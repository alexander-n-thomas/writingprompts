{"archived":true,"author":"prospectre","body":"It was 7:30 in the evening. A little bit after you would start a task, and a little bit before you would go to sleep. It is the worst time for a guest. I do not like guests. I prefer to be alone. That is why I moved to these apartments. Size was not important. Sound proofing and privacy were. This way I could sit in my silent home and not be bothered. But the incessant pounding on the door to my apartment would not relent. I heard #BADWORDS#uely claims that they were police officers.\n\nI open the door as far as the chain will allow. I see two men in standard issue police uniforms. The taller man holds up his badge and starts talking at me. I do not like to be talked at. He does not seem to care that it was now 7:31, and not a good time for me to have guests.\n\n\"Mr. Faulk?\", the tall officer asked.\n\n\"Yes\", I replied. I do not like talking with people. I want to go back inside.\n\n\"Mr. Faulk, there has been a lot of reports of missing people around these buildings. I'm sure you've heard. Would you mind letting us in so we can talk about this further?\". Troubling... \n\n\"I was not aware of anyone missing. I live alone and I keep to myself. And yes I would mind if you were to come into my apartment. It is now 7:32, and I do not like to have guests\". \n\nThe officer was put out by my refusal. I anticipate he will try to intimidate me. \"Look, Mr. Faulk, we've had reports of strange noises coming from your apartment. People have said you're a little shady as well. Now, you don't want this to look bad, do you? Because me and officer Pendelton here will come back with a warrant to search your home.\"\n\n7:34 now. In one minute I would have been pouring a cup of milk to drink. \"You are mistaken. I do not have any device, or perform any activity that would make noise. I live alone. I read. If you were to ask the landlord, you would find that I have never had a complaint against me. It is now 7:35. I have missed my glass of milk. If there is nothing else, I would like to go back inside.\"\n\nThe tall officer placed his hand on the door, even though I made no motion to close it. He is frustrated with me. Anger is a waste of time. \"Mr. Faulk, do you want to be arrested for interfering with an officer's duty to investigate a crime? The penalty for obstruction of justice is steep. And it's not looking too good for you right now.\"\n\nI looked over the other officer. He had placed his hand on his gun, but had not unfastened the holster. 7:36. This would be my second sip of milk. I do not like to miss my milk. \"I have done nothing wrong. I have been home since 4:55. I always get home at 4:55. You can verify all of this information at the front desk. I do not know why you are troubling me. I do not want you inside my home.\"\n\nThe tall officer slowly moved his hand off of my door. 7:37. I have missed my glass of milk completely. I now have 2 minutes of time unaccounted for, because I do not need to clean the glass. I do not like to have wasted time. \"Ok. Have it *your* way Mr. Faulk. We'll be back. Don't leave town, we've got our eye on you\", the tall officer said as he moved away from the door.\n\n\"I do not leave town. You have made me miss my milk, and now I have time that is not accounted for. I do not like my schedule being interrupted. Please do not come back\", the other officer rolled his eyes as he muttered \"freak\" under his breath. Insults are a waste of time. It is 7:39. I would have finished my milk and started to clean the glass by now. I would have to have my toasted bread and jam without having my milk now.\n\nI place the syringe I had behind my back on the table next to the door. I do not like to use it. I do not like my schedule being interrupted even less.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388538596","downs":0,"edited":"1388538823","gilded":0,"id":"ceeh6gj","link_id":"t3_1u4g01","name":"t1_ceeh6gj","parent_id":"t3_1u4g01","retrieved_on":1427910060,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"mellow_gecko","body":"When she asked me out, I immediately began to fantasise about her neck, and how sexy it would look with a thick rope squeezing terror into, and eventually out of, her eyes.  And I've got to say, she's done well with her choice of accessories.  She's wearing a nice, tight scarf.  It's the same shade of purple her face might turn if I were to reach out right now and slowly tigten away her life.  The thought pulses its way down my loins.  So I reach up to feel the texture of her scarf, which she let's me do without a blink, and I say \"This is a very well-chosen scarf, it suits you.\" The momentary flash of pride in her eyes betrays the hours she spent choosing the right scarf to meet me in.  It's always more enjoyable to alleviate a girl of the necessity to live, once she has begun to consider you as a potential partner for helping to create new life.  I'd already impregnated the last girl I strangled.  It'd be nice to do that again sometime, get confirmation of the pregnancy first, but I can't wait.  It needs to be tonight or I will explode in a pool of my own desire.\n\n\nI take her hand and walk us towards the pier.  \"You've already eaten, I take it?\"  She nods her head, pulls herself close to my arm and uses her other hand to stroke my fingers.  \"It's a beautiful night.  Let's live a million year old cliche and watch the stars, ey?\"  She smirks and something about her smirk unsettles me.  Perhaps I'm just nervous.  It's been a long-time since the last time I shared a woman's last few breaths.  Almost seven-months.  Blimey.  But, you've got to be careful.  There are people who care about women all over this world and some of them don't take too kindly to my little hobby.  I look at her and she's smiling, still stroking my fingers.  I'm just unsettled because I'm nervous; this has to go well.  The desire is reaching breaking point.  She's not quite ready to join me in my ba#BADWORDS#t of asphixiation, not quite yet.  She's submissive and willing to follow me, but she's still not in the right mood.  I want her eyes to swell with Romance.  I want her swimming in lust and trust.  It's no good if they don't want me or feel safe around me.  They have to feel completely safe.  I've been working on this girl for a few weeks.  We're almost ready.\n\nThe ocean is calm tonight and there are no clouds in the night's sky.  The stars are there, shining for us.  It's late on a Monday evening.  We're the only ones here.  I've put us in a Romantic cliche on purpose.  This girl is an absolute vacuum for this kind of stuff.  In a few minutes, I'm going to start talking about constellations.  Seriously.  She'll suck it all right up.  I take a deep, audible breath.  \"The ocean air is marvellous, isn't it?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" She exclaims.  She's like a teenage girl watching *The Notebook* for the first time.  \"I was brought up in Hong Kong.  The pollution there is terrible, you can hardly breath to save your life sometimes.  When I first came to this city and stood right here, where we are now, I felt like I could breath properly for the first time in my whole life.  It's wonderful. I love the fresh air.  I can't bare the idea of going back to Hong Kong.\"\n\nAll her talk of breathing and fresh air is making me hard.  I try stealthily to adjust myself.  She hasn't noticed; she's looking at the stars and breathing.  The ocean air is cooling her breath.  Soft, white whisps of life.  Rhythmic, gentle, counting down to her last.  I'm getting excited.  I need to relax or I will blow this whole thing.\n\nShe turns to me and something in her expression has changed.  She takes my hand and looks at my fingers.  \"You have such gorgeous fingers,\" she says.  \"I just want to keep them in my pocket.\"  She takes out a handkercheif.  Something is concealed inside it.  She pauses and then looks towards the stars.  \"I can never remember any of the constellations, can you?\"\n\nI leap to my chance like a well-trained toad.  I start gushing about Orion and pointing out the Big Dipper.  I begin my well-rehearsed anecdote about being a kid on a school trip watching the stars with my class.  We all decided the 'Big Dipper' was, in fact, just a nice big pot for boiling water and making tea.  I don't notice that she's taken something out of the handkercheif before something cold, hard and metallic is already deep inside my stomach.  I turn and look at her.  She's smiling.  There is a glimmer of lust in her eyes as my hands fall to my stomach.  Blood.  I'm in shock.  I don't move.  She hits me on the side of the head, knocking me to the ground.  She ties my legs and my arms behind my back.  She puts the knife against my cheek.  She kisses me.  She kisses me like I kiss them before their last breaths. I almost fall in love, but blood is so messy.  Her technique is not well-practiced.  All her weight is on my legs and lower back.  I feel the knife against my fingers.  A sharp sawing pain richochets through my little finger.  She's cutting it off!  She shows it to me, wraps it in its own handkercheif and then kisses my forehead. \"Be brave,\" she says.  \"This won't take long and then it will all be over.\"  She sounds like me.\n\nShe does this for every one of my fingers and she keeps them in her pocket.  Then she slits my throat and pushes me over the pier.  My body lands with a sonorous splash and for the first time, I think I understand what it means to be loved.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388545224","downs":0,"edited":"1388547570","gilded":0,"id":"ceej8pt","link_id":"t3_1u223u","name":"t1_ceej8pt","parent_id":"t3_1u223u","retrieved_on":1427909046,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Kenji, he’s casting smoke rings into the air and making faces at the people who are walking by.  Few stare, and even less make faces back, but most don't even see him.  For hours, he has been on the bridge leading to the train station at Hon-Atsugi, and you could say that this is the story of his life.  Being on bridges, that is. In a metaphorical sense.\n\nHe says that ugliness can be found everywhere, but every so often he proves himself wrong by admiring the scattered graffiti along the sides of the bridge.  Taking a finger, he enjoys tracing the outlines of what he calls messages from God, as though each stroke could change the fact that he often says he does not believe in such things.  Can you hear them, he asks, the voices in these walls?  I shake my head, and he gives me a look of pity.  Kenji insists that they are hints to the mystery of life, tempting and elusive secrets waiting to be discovered, but I am reminded of Kenji’s perspective of life: a long tube that grows smaller and smaller until we are unable to move forward.\n\nTatsuo believes in the opposite.  He is sitting on the side of the bridge, trying to predict the destinations of each person walking by.  The woman in white is going to meet her friends at the department store.  The young teenagers are headed to soccer practice.  The married man with the briefcase heading to the escort service will soon attend his own funeral.  The elderly man with a hunchback, who has walked by twice, is God and he is going everywhere and nowhere at once.  He stirs when Kenji speaks of the graffiti on the wall, and shakes his head.  He argues that these writings are only truths we already know but choose to ignore.  All in all, they are there to be observed and have their existence acknowledged.  Reminders, not instructions, the difference is monumental.\n\nMe, I’m just checking my watch.  Your train comes in half an hour, and soon I’ll meet you at the station.  We’ll catch the express to Shinjuku.  Maybe we’ll walk around.  Get some coffee.  People watch.  Fall in love.  Who knows.  Kenji and Tatsuo, they're still arguing about the messages you left on the wall, and even when we’re far away, they’ll still be there forever trying to figure out what you’re trying to tell me.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388553522","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceelhp7","link_id":"t3_1u4z4t","name":"t1_ceelhp7","parent_id":"t3_1u4z4t","retrieved_on":1427907952,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

His eyes were filled with sorrow, self loathing, and a story never told. I am sure it had everything to do with The Raid. That's always been the case.\n\n\"You think I'm a damn coward,\" he proclaimed in a shrill voice, perching the tension.\n\nI was shocked.\n\n*This man has never said a word.

{"archived":true,"author":"BigGreenCountry","body":"His name was Irving Beltram, I should say is but despite him living through the ordeal, the Irving Beltram that was born and raised in Southern Oklahoma is no longer the same man. He came from a wealthy family, an heir to a great oil fortune. Normal enough as a child as far as appearances and at#BADWORDS#ude go. He was from good stock and generally good people. Wealth does not always account for taste but his kind were well enough to get by in this small town. What really set Irving apart from the rest of us, was his uncanny ability to hit whatever he was aiming for, whether he was throwing a rock, shooting skeet with shot guns, target practicing with pistols, air rifles, paint balls, or assault rifles, the boy was a natural gun. Projectiles became his passion. Several boy scout medals, and high school skeet team awards, and he was hooked. \n\nNaturally this was only the beginning of a young mans passion. He had to continue on in life and find his way as a professional. He worked at a local pawn shop for a time selling guns and making a few repairs for people. Done a little bit of private coaching but this was not it, there was no college for s#BADWORDS#, and that is what he was. After seeking out his opportunities that pleased his family he was still not satisfied. They wanted him to stay home and watch the family ventures, and were happy with his hobbies attempting to coax him into keeping them as such. But it couldn't be, the boy had a sincere passion. He only knew of one career that would fulfill his desire for the true science of a s#BADWORDS#, an Army Special Forces Sniper. His thickness tuned him out of world politics, or even friendly advice, and his determination led him to the recruiter. Being an outdoors-man of sorts his physical condition was fine enough, and his shooting was excellent, he proved himself over time after his initial enlistment. It was everything he had hoped for the raw firepower the comradely the focus. He made it through sniper school. The time had begun.\n\nUnfortunately Irving was as I said a good man. He was an extremely determined individual and was ready to set aside his emotional attachments to pursue the ultimate challenge. His first assignment had came Uruzgan, Afghanistan, a mountainous region in Southern Afghanistan, his heart pounded his adrenaline pumped, the chopper ride in with his team was quiet and intense. The mission was mute, the test was in him, it was all about him. They had a target,  a name he couldn't pronounce, it was for the best though. \n\nThey rappelled from the chopper onto a rocky outlook, his mission was simple and he was already in his location. His spotter nearby his camo deployed. It was time to make his calculations. He was to cover his team from ambush as they made entrance to the cave down hill of his position. The time ticked by, what felt like hours into the night, his eye caught movement in the sights his heart pounding in his throat, goosebumps on his skin and the hair sticking up on his neck. He peered through his sites to the scene in front of the cave the team had entered. His breath steady. The air calm. The mountain was calm, he was right at a mile away from his target area, a shot he couldn't miss. The team reports they have captives inside, they are taking prisoners no shots had to be fired yet. The sight flickers again, this time men, armed about to breech the entrance of the cave, he looks closer the men are not men at all mere children, not more than 8 or 10. The weapons look ridiculous in their small hands. It finally hits him what he's about to do. It makes him sick, almost violently so. His stomach wrenches his eyes tear up. He fires. \n\nHe and his spotter are the only two of a six man team to return home. His discharge is honorable but no one believes that. His mental health has deteriorated quickly since he's been home. He no longer owns a gun. He leads a simple life, never goes out much, never married. The business went south after a few bad decisions. Irving Beltram is still around, and he's a good man..in a bad place.

They say that the outsiders have corrupted people in Krasnostav , and we have a riot on our hands. Half of the guys think it's #BADWORDS# , just to take our minds of the hunger . The other half , well , they finished polishing their Carbines . \n\n\nI was sitting close to the door , so i  get to ride shotgun. No turret-duty on this one! \n\n**27th of March**\n\nI haven't found time to write in the last week or so , with the revolution and all . The Great Leader is dead they say . I don't know what to believe any more , since the seconds the seat was empty , another one came in . Some  Vasili Ivanovich Golovkin, a diplomat they say . \n\nHe keeps promising to get us food from the outsiders , and that we will establish contact with them . With him being a diplomat and all , he may just do it . But the border guard keeps getting reinforced every night.\n\n**29th of March**\n\nI signed up for a special program , asking for volunteers to go out and establish contact with the Outsiders . I never believed in them , or the propaganda fed to us about them being evil , so i signed up to satisfy my curiosity . And they gave out a free ration of meat for every signature , so i couldn't resist.\n\n\n\n**30th of March**\n\n\nI've been chosen to lead a small team , and sent to a training camp out in the countryside .They gave us new Avtomats , new uniforms , a new pair of leather boots and briefed us about how to act . We were to scout out the terrain , report back , and ,if conditions seem favourable , escort a diplomat to whatever they used as administrative centers .  \n\nWe were given classified phrasebooks ( very short , mine was 15 pages , mostly insults , hellos and asking for food) , and ordered not to shoot unless directly endangered .\n\nI even got a new notebook , and some kind of pen who did not need constant refilling with ink !\n\nWe were 6 in total , and we were given a new transport vehicle , with extra armor and a small cannon on top . Most of them were city folks like me , except Vitaly , who was  a border guard , and Ivan , who was  a peasant.\n\n**1st of April**\n\nWe exited the country through checkpoint F . One of the few holes in the \"Great Patriotic  Border Wall\" , and strangely, the only one where the wall was pink , instead of the usual grey . It wouldn't have been wise to ask , but i had my theory on why . \n\nFor a few hours , this looked like the old country . Then , after riding through fields and a hills , we got to some kind of road . Not a dirt road like the ones in our forest , but more like the Great National Highway back home . We followed it , and soon we laid eyes on what looked like another car . We got closer , but saw it was just a burned-out wreck .\nUp to this point , we all imagined the Outside was some kind of utopia , or some kind of hell , as described in our books . But this car was a familiar sight - sure , it was bigger and looked sturdier than our little toad-like People's Car , but it was the same concept .\n\nWe decided it was safer to sleep in the armored vehicle , as Ivan spotted a bear earlier.\nWe all were a bit disapointed , except Vitaly . He was always very cynic , probably because his job implied killing civilians running towards what they hoped was freedom .\n\n**2nd of April**\n\nWe kept heading across the road ,  and got to what must be one of the wonders of their civilization - a huge road , suspended above the ground , with six lanes on each sides.\n\nAs soon as we saw it on the horizon , we heard a deafening roar , and saw clouds of smoke pouring from it . We decided to head closer , but found no way of getting on . The radio was picking up all kinds of signals , mostly strange music resembling the sounds of the computer at the People's Science Ins#BADWORDS#ute i visited as a child . We decided to try speaking on the radio , but to no avail , so we fired of burst of tracer ammo into the night sky . \n\n**3rd of April**\n\nThe tracers were of no effect . A group of young people dressed in skimpy , bright clothes , like the ones used by construction workers ,passed by us . We tried talking to them , but to no avail. We hypothesize they are deaf , as they have wires coming out of their ears . This would make communication difficult .\n\nThey stopped under the bridge , and started drinking from a brown bag . One also injected some form of medication in his arm , then promptly passed out . As good natured as he is , Ivan suggested he was sick , and that bringing him to a hospital or healing him ourselves would win us the natives approval .\n\nWe got close to them , but we were still ignored . \nWe suspected their eyesight was poor , and confounded our uniforms with the grey-green background. There may be more phisiological differences , our doctor proposed , as they differed greatly from us . They were short , fat , had dark skin and brightly coloured hair . \n\nWhen we picked up the sick one , a female threw a bottle at us , but it fell short , and broke . We picked up the smell of alcohol , and suspected our first contact would be with inebriated individuals , so we quickly backed out . \n\nTwo of them tried to give chase , but strangely fainted after a few hundred yards . Physical activity does not seem their strong point.\n\n**4th of April**\n\nWe returned after at dawn , but there was no-one left . We came to the conclusion that this was insufficient data to bring back home , so we kept going until we reached a small settlement . As our supplies drew low , we decided we should engage in a trade with the local population . Vanya proposed we give out bullets for food , but the cashier ignored us when he found out we did not have any of his currency.\n\nIvan kept banging at his transparent window , but he ignored us . Ivan pulled his pistol out , and shot the glass , but it was apparently invincible . The owner , visibly frightened , pushed a button which triggered a strange alarm noise , and pulled out his own rifle . \n\nThe reason he kept a rifle was beyond me , as he looked civilian , but i suppose their military uniform may be different , as he wore a strange , white dress like garment and a towel on his head .\n\nWe quickly ran away , but small , black and white cars not unlike those of the Peoples Peacekeepers gave chase , with howling sirens and bright lights . We cut it through the woods , and decided to shoot them with our cannons and return to the Homeland without further disturbing them \n\n**8th of April** . \n\nWe reached the border , and were greeted back like heroes . After the debriefing , however , the general staff quickly sent us away , commenting on how we gave up too easily , and that our action may have endangered the Homeland. Further incursions into the Outside were banned , and it seemed the country returned to the conditions before the revolution .\n\nI am scheduled for trial tomorrow , as are my teammates , but we suppose it is just a show trial , as we did nothing wrong . I am eager to return to my post with the 2nd Cav. Division .\n\n\n*Sergeant Yuri Feodorovichi Samoylov was found guilty of the following*-**High Treason**\n\n**-Incompetence**\n\n**-Fraternizing with Outsiders**\n\n**-Attempted Robbery**\n\n*And was summarily executed on the 9th of April , by a firing squad of the People's Peacekeepers. All the other members were convicted to a Re-Education Labor Camp of their choice*\n\n**This is my first time posting , and i am not a native english speaker , so any advice/criticism would be welcome!**\n\n**I may have gone a bit off topic ,not having the king part , but i kind of like it !**\n\nEDIT: My formatting sucked","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388677618","downs":0,"edited":"1388683476","gilded":0,"id":"cefi5sq","link_id":"t3_1u80n1","name":"t1_cefi5sq","parent_id":"t3_1u80n1","retrieved_on":1427891125,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

The moon hovered like a far-off saucer, shining dimly, reflecting light off its silent face. Fog stole to the streets, filling in the emptiness. Janice woke with a start. Cold sweat trickled down her spine and she opened her eyes, shivering. She lay on her bed quietly when suddenly a wave a nausea hit her. She gagged but managed to contain the slimy sickness from coming out her mouth. A cramp hit her, pressing up against her abdomen like a hot iron. She gasped, clutching her stomach, waiting for the pain to subside. Minutes passed and she stood, walking to the bathroom, feeling her way through the dark. She dizzily opened the door and sat on the toilet. As she pulled off her panties, she noticed a few blood stains on them. \n\n\"Dammit\" she groaned under breath. She stood and went to the cabinet, but couldn't find any #BADWORDS#s. \"#BADWORDS#.\" She pulled back on her panties, pulled on some sweatpants and a sweatshirt, grabbed her keys, and walked out the door. Yawning, she unlocked her car and climbed inside. She put the keys in the ignition and watched as the car flashed to life; the orange digital clock shone through the gloom. It read 2:13 a.m. as Janice pulled out of the driveway. She drove slowly, careful of the creeping fog that lingered about her car. The pharmacy was only about three miles away, but it took her longer than usual to get there. She pulled in just as another cramp hit her side hard. She got out of the car slowly and walked to the front door of the pharmacy. The inside shone brightly and she saw the man at the front desk talking with a customer. As her hand reached for the door something grabbed her. She turned around, only to see three hulking men crowding behind her. A scream escaped her throat as one of the men wrapped his hand around her mouth. She resisted with all that she had, but the three of them were starting to drag her away. As they quickly pulled her in their van, she managed to let out one final cry for help. She bit down on the hand that had gagged her and screamed as loudly as she could.\n\n\"Help me! Help me please! Don't let them take me. Don't let the bad guys take me!\" she begged, tears streaming down her face. The two men in the pharmacy looked her way, but just stared at her, immotile, watching as two large hands grabbed her face and pulled her into the van- her refulgent blue eyes pleading to be saved.

{"archived":true,"author":"mnemoniac","body":"Legendary inspector Joachim Javert, JJ to his friends and papers had traveled a long road to sneak aboard Dr. Isabella Swan's orbital station.  Navigating its security and personnel to get to Dr. Swan herself had been the greatest challenge of his professional career, but none the less he stood before no less a person than Dr. Swan herself.  He hadn't made any sound on his entrance, and she didn't know he was there yet.  She was gazing out of the large shielded window in her office at the enigmatic ship she'd been building there for years.\n\nIt was a massive affair, larger than the station it was docked with, and nearly complete.  Divining the purpose of the ship had been what started JJ on the case those many months ago, and although he'd learned that Dr. Swan was behind its construction both financially and intellectually, the purpose of the ship remained a mystery.  The many abductions of scientists Dr. Swan was also responsible for seemed to suggest the massive vessel was some sort of warship, so the fields of the missing personnel seemed to suggest.\n\nDeciding the time was right, JJ announced himself, \"Quite the view, Dr. Swan.\"\n\nShe didn't seem surprised by his voice, and turned to face him.  She wore the skinsuits mandated by station policy, much as JJ himself wore,  Although it was form-fitting, it was not terribly thin, and any curves her figure might have held were concealed by the suit, although it preserved her general form.  Her face was carefully neutral as she answered, \"Yes, Inspector, quite the sight indeed.\"\n\nThey were usually surprised, but no matter, it was time for JJ to learn the truth, and through the transmitter he wore, time for the Earth to learn.  \"And you wanted to be close to oversee the final stages of construction.\"\n\nShe smiled a little, \"No.\"\n\nHe feigned surprised and stepped closer, keeping enough distance to keep the advantage of his low-velocity pistol, \"This must be one of the most expensive sight-seeing trips in history then.\"\n\nShe glanced down at one of the screens on her desk and smiled more broadly, then turned back to the window, \"Rather that trying to needle out why I'm here, why not tell me why you are here, Inspector?  You've snuck aboard my station without permission, at no small cost to myself.\"\n\n\"I'm not the one who needs to answer questions here, Dr. Swan.  You've left a lot of mystery with your ship there.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you must answer my question.  You are here in my realm, you may use your pistol to kill me, but ransacking my records will get you no swift answers, I assure you, and you may not leave by the path you entered.\"\n\nJJ resisted looking back at the vent he'd used to enter, no use giving that away, and let an easy smile fall onto his lips, \"Maybe a bargain then?  You answer a question, then I answer one.\"\n\nStill facing away she spoke, \"My question first.  Then I will answer one of yours.\"\n\nJJ frowned, but waited no more than a breath before answering, \"I'm here to discover what you've done with the people you've kidnapped.\"\n\n\"A lie of omission is still a lie, Inspector.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I am trying to engineer a simple and honest exchange of information.  So allow me to be clear.  I will be just as evasive or honest as you are with my answer.  I will give you one more chance to answer my question.\"\n\nSilence stretched out into discomfort before JJ answered, \"I'm here to determine why you've built that ship, what purpose it is to be put to.  Why you've been kidnapping brilliant scientists, and whether they're still alive and safe.\"\n\nShe nodded and turned back to JJ, \"A more complete answer, although I notice that you've omitted who you are working for.  You are correct in believing the abductions are tied to the ship, but not in the manner you suspect.  You've been wrapped up in looking at me, have you paid any attention to the world stage lately?\"\n\n\"An answer for an answer Dr. Swan, now you ask another question?\"\n\n\"An answer in and of itself.  We are at the brink of disaster.  Those with power hunger ever for more and care little for the consequences.\"  She paused and looked at JJ for a moment, \"But then, I don't suppose my reasons matter to you.  All you want to know is what that ship is and why all those people have disappeared.\"\n\nJJ was quiet, waiting, this was the moment when silence would weigh heavier than anything he could say.  Dr. Swan began again, \"That is a generation ship, Inspector, and all the people I've taken are for its crew.  The expertise your superiors are so worried about could be bent to weapons, yes, but it is also useful for any number of peaceful purposes.  You have your answer.  Now what will you do with it?\"\n\nJJ glanced out the window at the vast ship, it no longer seemed sinister, only ponderous.  \"Rescue those people, arrest you.\"\n\nShe smiled again and shook her head, \"I think not JJ.  The transmitter you're wearing cannot broadcast beyond this room, and there is no way to leave other than through the use of my terminal, which is quite locked.  And even if none of that were true, you're far too late to effect a rescue.\"\n\nAs if on queue a brilliant light stream through the window for a heartbeat before the window tinted so heavily anything beyond it was an obscure shape.  Even then the light of the massive ship's engines could be seen.  It was moving.  JJ took a few steps forward, then raised his gun to Dr. Swan, \"Stop that ship!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nJJ rushed a few steps closer, \"STOP THAT SHIP!\"\n\n\"No.\"  She was calm, looking at his gun with a kind of easy relaxation one most easily finds in a person after a satisfying day at work.\n\nJJ pushed her chair aside and frantically typed on her computer, but it quietly insisted on a password, and JJ had no idea.  \"Dammit Dr. Swan, please stop the ship.  Those people are losing their families, they don't deserve it.\"\n\n\"It is an interesting thing, Javert, that human beings often see only what we want to see.  It takes much training and careful diligence to see beyond our limitations.  You have the training, but were lax here.  Those people I took, took their families with them.  Very few were truly unwilling to make the journey, and none were forced to leave behind loved ones.  Such a thing would poison the future.  As I said, you are too late to stop it.  To stop anything, really.\"\n\nThe last sentence Dr. Swan spoke made JJ's blood run cold, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I've been planning this for so long in secret, you have no idea how liberating it is to see just how effective my precautions were, and how fulfilling it is to fool the world's greatest detective.  Allow me to explain.  Your arrival here, which you believed a secret, was no such thing.  I will tell you what the world will believe.  A heavily decorated inspectors sneaks onto the world's foremost research and development station pursuing a lead on his latest case.  But, treachery!\"  Dr. Swan stood again, silhouetted against the black and white of the tinted window.\n\n\"Your own superiors were working against you all along.  They used your clever adventure to get a bomb on board the station, for fear of the device being constructed, and used that bomb to destroy the station along with the mysterious construction.  There will be no trace of the construction, and no one will survive the bomb.  No one will look for the ship.\"\n\nJJ looked at her in horror, and there was time for nothing more, for the station was torn apart by an explosion, and the parts not immediately destroyed were cast into dangerous orbits to decay and burn up or drift lifelessly.  The #BADWORDS#anic initial burn of the generation ship was expended, and now it drifted forward on subtler drives.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388686554","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceflsdf","link_id":"t3_1u1bpd","name":"t1_ceflsdf","parent_id":"t3_1u1bpd","retrieved_on":1431768955,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

An army was only as strong as its weakest link and the same was true of the imperial bodyguards, the brotherhood sworn to defend the emperor to the last man. But no one had told him what to do when he was the last man.\n\nThe emperor rose from the jade throne. \n\n\"What is your name son?\"\n\n\"Higen, Sire\"\n\n\"Higen. That is a strong name. A warrior's name. Why are you here Higen?\"\n\n\"To defend you Sire, to serve and defend the state and the divine emperor\"\n\nThe emperor smiled and looked at Higen for a long time. Explosions shook the palace and the courtyard rung with the sound of clashing steel. To enter the holy city without the leave of the emperor was punishable by death. But rules seemed to matter very little at the moment.\n\n\"You don't actually believe that do you Higen?\"\n\n\"Believe what Sire?\"\n\n\"Please don't call me that. You don't actually believe that I am divine, do you?\"\n\n\"Sire?\"\n\n\"I am just a man Higen, exactly like you. I am as much of a God as you are, no more and no less. When the rebellion executes me, my supposedly sacrosanct head will be removed from my body with surprisingly little opposition from above\"\n\nHigen did not know what to say. Was this a trick? Another test? Perhaps the emperor was testing his loyalty in these last moments. Higen watched as the emperor rose from his chair and carefully removed his royal crown and robes. In his undershirt and without the rich garb, the emperor could have been a fishmonger.\n\n\"We have our roles to play Higen, for better or worse. I have often wondered where will ends and destiny begins, but this much is certain. You have not been alone in writing the story of your life. Maybe it was a cruel joke that fate had the pen when he wrote you into this room with me. At least you can decide how the next few lines, perhaps your last, will read.\"\n\nHigen looked down at his clutched hands. He had so many regrets, so many things he wished he had done differently, so much time he had wasted.\n\n\"If that is true Sire, then you don't have too many lines left to write either. Perhaps we can both end our stories in a manner we may be proud of.\"\n\nThe emperor smiled. With great care, he put on his robe. Higen placed the crown on the emperor's head and helped the old man onto the throne. Together, they waited as the screams and sounds of pounding feet edged nearer.\n\nOutside, it started to rain.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388691143","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cefny2y","link_id":"t3_1u8n2y","name":"t1_cefny2y","parent_id":"t3_1u8n2y","retrieved_on":1431769953,"score":14,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":14}

I'm afraid I am the ORIGINAL inventor of the time machine, not like the weirdo who stole my plans when I never returned to my original timeline. Once again I seem to have #BADWORDS# up.\nThis all started a few weeks ago; when my good for nothing boyfriend dumped me. After graduating with a first in astrophysics at the age of 14 this was humiliating. 21 and my boyfriend for the past 3 years leaves without a word. So I did what any angry jealous ex does when she believes her previous partner is a lying evil prick, she builds a time machine to ultimately destroy him and whatever #BADWORDS# he ran off with. \n\nAfter a few weeks I calmed down a bit. I ultimately decided that killing them would not be worth the time or effort, nor the jail sentence, so I set my mind to broader horizons. Dreams of Nobel Prizes fueled my work till the portal-esque machine was finished. It was like a metallic gate way, smooth with doors that slid to each side when a date was confirmed on the panel. I obviously assumed that my primitive version would be kept on display so that when I stepped into the future, to see where my obvious genius would get me.\n\nSwirling lights of blue passed around me and as I stepped into the sun light I could feel the dust in the air. This certainly wasn't right. This was MY house surly it must be a national monument to science??! As I looked around, dazed I heard yelling and shouting. Some one was pulling me and grabbing my arms, I was so tired. I woke up in this prison cell. Technology has massively advanced since my original timeline. Apparently time travel is \"not permitted\" now-a-days. I am to be put to death for a law I didn't even know existed while someone else takes the glory for inventing the machine I built.

{"archived":true,"author":"kingofchairs","body":"I think it was something I did. The children must understand that I didn't mean to let my heart die. I wanted it to live and give them my song. I wanted my bars to ring and resonate with the blissful melodies. What could I have done to destroy my own heart? I cannot fathom what force could have stopped its beating. It must have been me. There must have been something I could have done differently, some way I could have shown my heart that I am the perfect home, the perfect place to make its song. But what more could I have done? Could it not feel the love I felt for it? Could my heart not feel the love from the children, as I could? I must not have been the best home that I could be. But how? We had made beautiful music together, filled the house with song.\n \nThe children often gathered around me to watch. Their faces were so bright. They would sometimes purse their lips and whistle along, in tune with that of my heart. They loved me, and they cared for my heart, giving it food and water so that it could sing for them day after day. In the nighttime, they would d#BADWORDS# a cloth over me. It would calm my heart, and quiet my song. I would spend all night waiting, while my heart rested, for morning to come so that I could see the children again. They would remove the cloth and my heart would awaken, singing, and I would feel the love wash over me, every day, again and again. I wish I could know what I did.\n\nWhy did my heart stop beating? I loved my song so much. I loved being loved. When they pulled out my heart that painful day, I saw that it was no more than a cold husk. It had no more song to give. And so I am. A cold husk. The children didn't look at me the same way after I lost my life. There were no more smiles. There was no more laughter. They would give me only an occasional passing glance, as if they were looking straight through me. It hurt so much to lose my warmth, my song, but it hurt so much more to lose their smiles. They pulled the cloth over me for the last time and all has been dark and cold ever since. Can there be an existence worse than this? What torture! I can no longer give song. I can no longer fulfill my purpose, so therefore I must be dead, I must be. This is what death is. You lose the essence of your being, never to return. I can never create another smile in this house, nor can I even look upon those who used to smile. When I had my heart.\n\nWhat is this? Is my imagination taking over in this infinite darkness? I can hear my song again! As if it were right here, in my body! Oh! The children have lifted the cloth! I can see light again! Am I dreaming? I find myself surrounded my smiling faces. I haven't seen these children in so long, this must be an illusion! The child that stands directly in front of me has a smile wider than I have ever seen. Who would smile so brightly at an empty husk like me? No! It can't be! The child smiles even wider and raises his finger, on which is perched a new heart, even more beautiful than the heart I lost. It is so vibrant! Greens, blues, and reds dance around each other on its vibrant coat. My God, it is just as beautiful to see as it is to hear! My new heart gazes into me, joining the joyful gazes of the children. It chirps beautifully. I can feel my entire body resonate with each note. I had forgotten this feeling! The child delicately places my heart on its perch and I am resurrected. I am living! My heart beats stronger than ever before. The children gather around me now, as they always had. Surrounded by smiling faces at last, I fill the house with song once again.

Unless you’ve got a criticality event.” He pronounced the last two words slowly. “But we will teach you how to fix our reactor in case something goes wrong.” He turned to the wall on which drawings and procedures were beamed for two long semesters. Up until that last month, when we got to the red console. A replica was on the instructor’s desk when we came in. “This, ladies and gentlemen, is judgment day. All wrapped up in six seconds.  Say all systems are mobilized, you’ve done everything by the book. But it’s not your lucky day. The universe has chosen to take a massive #BADWORDS# on you.” I blinked. I had never heard this almost retired officer come even close to a swear word. He pointed at the red metallic rectangle in front of him. “This, the red console, replaces your usual controls. It’s the computer’s way of saying ‘I am too chicken #BADWORDS# to take a decision’. And you’ve got six seconds.” I never knew exactly why it was six, not twelve or three. Six seconds to push that button and jettison the whole compartment and most of the ship’s water. Or not. And risk a catastrophic containment breach. A *cri-ti-ca-li-ty* event. \n\n“If you jettison and are less than a hundred years in, you can turn around and come back home”, the instructor had said. “More than that and you can’t. It’s quick burning death or slow, kill-your-neighbor-for-food death. Until the lights go out. And you know how many years we’re in.”\n \nA one in ten thousand event. The training room has been very silent back then. Nervous cadets were picturing themselves in front of that red console. Counting to six silently. \n\nThirty-seven years since I’ve taken the helm of the Glory, on its grand mission to fly mankind’s last children to Alpha Centauri. On the overhead display, surrounded by blue light, I was watching the recovery procedures fail one after another. Error messages I never knew existed flashing at increasing speed. It was nighttime on Glory. I called my crew. And before I could fully describe the chain of events, the console appeared. With its outdated looking bulging, analogic red button. That’s how it went. 5. Your eyes bulge out of their sockets. You start to shake. 4. Somebody says something, in high-pitched horror, but your brain is so focused on the button that… 3. Something warm creeps into your jumpsuit. You just peed yourself. 2. With a primal scream you never knew you had, like a man about to hit a wall in a fast moving car, you smash the button. Then there is silence.\n\nSensors tell me there’s only two of us now. A one in fifty billion event. One other guy siphoning what’s left of the life systems. And me, in my mahogany cabin, behind the blast door. Lights have been gone for two full days. Or maybe more. I can’t even see my hand and the gun that I’m holding. I used our last resources to turn Glory around. In about a million years, we will crash somewhere in the solar system. To be home at last. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388711113","downs":0,"edited":"1388760372","gilded":0,"id":"cefwokg","link_id":"t3_1u9f4j","name":"t1_cefwokg","parent_id":"t3_1u9f4j","retrieved_on":1431774146,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":true,"author":"Jamesev93","body":"She was so perfect. It had been atleast 6 months since they had met, but in those 6 months what a transformation she had undertaken. She shed 40 kilos; none from her breasts; the perfect hour glass figure.\n\n She claimed she wasn't doing anything different, since she came back from her holiday in central Africa. The number of attentive friends that surrounded her signaled that something must have changed. No one knew what it was though.\n\nThe coroner couldn't work it out either. \n\nShe was the image of health; beauty even. Every inch of her supple skin, perfection personified. It was a shock to all when her boyfriend woke to find her without a heart beat, though she was more radiant than the day previous.\n\nThe death was treated as su#BADWORDS#ious. After all, a beautiful girl who'd made an amazing transformation, from anonymity to near s#BADWORDS#om, in a matter of months; someone had to be envious. Men would walk from their wives, enchanted in the streets. The pied piper would have turned green with envy at the sight. \n\nThe coroner checked the skin. Supple and soft to the touch, it was unblemished - despite the families assertion of scars and stretch marks. The coroner checked the hair for toxins. Nothing but the sweet smell of strawberry shampoo. The coroner then checked the blood. The red blood cell count, the white blood cell count - not just within toleration - it was scientifically perfect. He double checked, and triple checked. Truth be told he was sure of his work, but he could not bare the thought of having to ruin this masterpiece with a scalpel. Alas, the decision was made. The organs were revealed; Perfect in size and colour. The body was unparallelled. It was as though there was nothing left to improve.\n\nBack at the funeral, open coffin of course,  the crowd had turned out in droves. There were men swooning at the coffin side, women both enchanted and envious of a corpse's ability; perfect as it may be; to take their mans' attention from them.\n\nShe coughed.\n\n Silence fell upon the room. She coughed and spluttered and they came running. All crowded beside the coffin. The eager want for this snow white to wake from this slumber was palpable. Then she opened her eyes. Her eyes wide with fear and pain. Her mouth, agape, let out a great puff of orange mist. It covered the beautiful black gowns of the women, the solemn silk suites of the men, even the garb of the attending priest. With that last breath of life, she was gone. Her aura had faded.\n\nThe rest of the funeral went smoothly, relatively speaking of course. But when he went home, Jim felt the wanton need to sleep, and sleep deeply he did. The next day was uneventful, and the day after, and even the days preceding it. \n\nUntil one day he felt the eyes upon him.\n\nSurely enough, he would find himself catching the glaces of women at work. Huddled around the water cooler they whispered and murmured, stealing as much of a glance Jim's way as they could. Walking the street, women would stumble in his presence. Usually an unknown, at clubs he was approached endlessly by loose women ready to give their lives for him.\n\nHe looked himself in the mirror. He looked the same as he always had. He picked up a picture from the funeral. He, in his faded black suit, stood gaunt over the other attendees. His arms were too long and his hair was messy. But his face. His face was, different? He held it beside his face in the mirror. His nose wasn't crooked anymore. His eyes, not so sunken. His jaw, chiseled. He took of his shirt. His muscles, defined, made the perfect guiding lines down... He extended his waste band, well, there was definitely a big improvement to say the least.\n\nThe next day, he walked like a new man. Astute in his conviction and self esteem. His tongue, once quivering at the though of talking to Ashley, was made of silver this day, and from this day on. It was Ashley who found herself at a loss for words. Jim's interest in her was something she had dreamed of, if only recently. She had not noticed him before in the office, maybe, through the barrage of unwarranted sexual advances, he had avoided her gaze. Yet, here she was, quaking, giddy as a school girl. She was at a loss for words. She could scarcely remember how the conversation went. She knew she had to be ready at 6pm, dressed to the nines, but apart from that, Jim's eyes, his beautiful blue eyes, the conversation was a sweaty palmed blur. She was under his spell, and she knew it. \n\nThe next 5 and a half months were the best of Jim's life. His career had jumped, due in part to his confidence, but in greater part due to his ability to stand out in the crowd. Ashely was wonderful, an eager lover with the fervor of youth, attentive and dependable. Although their time together had been brief, he knew it in his heart: this is how his life would continue. \n\nHe had purchased the ring. Held it in his pocket for the last two days. The next day he would wake early, make breakfast and slip the ring on one of the roses he had bought, ready for Ashely to wake to. \n\nHowever, he did not wake. Ashely found him, without a pulse. She screamed bloody murder. The knife was further twisted when she found the ring. She was inconsolable in her grief.\n\nAt the funeral the crowds turned out in droves. Work colleagues, friends and acquaintances he'd met along this last 6 month journey all felt a deep sorrow for Jim's passing. The coroner could not explain it, nor could he explain the deaths of the 150 other random men and women in their sleep that same night. Their only apparent connection was their beauty. As though they were angels that were returning to heaven. Jim looked as such. A body of a god, the face of perfection and a heart of gold. But he had passed, and the ceremony had began. The coffin was open, of course, for all to marvel in his beauty. Then, Jim coughed, and spluttered, and all crowded around with bated breath, eager for Jim to rise.\n\n He did, with pain in his eyes, his mouth agape...\n\n\n\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; Haven't written much, constructive criticism welcomed! \n\n\nEdit: Wrote this all and then emergency maintenance &gt;:(\n\nEDIT2: Changed some words and grammar so it reads like I want it to.\n\nedit 3: Someone gave me gold :D that was very nice of you.

You looked up at me, unafraid, from two beautiful, stormy gray eyes above  a perfect button nose. You had two perfect hands and eight perfect fingers – your pinkies curved in on the edges, just like mine. At least I gave you something.\nI wish you could know how much I love you. I want you to have the life you deserve, and, for that reason, I could not keep you, no matter how much my heart aches to keep you. \n\nInstead, I gave you to your parents. I’m sure you’ve seen pictures. Your mom, she had the brightest smile when she held you in her arms, tears falling down her face as she kissed your rosy little cheek.\n\nYou were the son they couldn’t have, and they were able to care for you in all the ways you should have been cared for. They could give you the life I couldn’t. No matter what the songs say, sometimes love isn’t enough.\n\nThey have cared for you in all the ways you should be cared for. On that first day, they wrapped you in a soft, forest green blanket crocheted by your new grandmother. Your baby blue cap was  a gift from your uncle; your first rattle came from your cousins. They took you home to their four-bedroom house in the suburbs where they work good jobs and gave you everything you could ever need.\n\nI loved you just as strongly – no more, no less – from my tiny apartment, just me and my demons. \n\nYou are the angel in my world, Gabriel. Perhaps you could have saved me, but I couldn’t take the chance I would condemn you.\n\nLooking back, all I ask is you do not see me as a monster who abandoned you. Don’t ever think I didn’t love you or that there is anything wrong with you. It’s me. I will never be able to give you the life you deserve, and the life you need. You, my son, are perfect. I am the one who's broken. I could not leave you with the scars my parents left me.\n\nIf, today, on your eighteenth birthday, you have any questions for me, you can come ask me. I will be in the corner booth at McNary’s café down on First Street at noon on Sunday. I’m going to order the pecan pie.  If you don’t come, I’ll understand.

So, I dragged her out and placed her legs under my car.  I tell ya, she sure caught her breath enough to scream as I slowly rolled over 'em.  Figurin' it was time to be gone, I straddled her screaming, flailing body and let the blood out of her throat.

{"archived":true,"author":"hamsterling","body":"*\"After darkness falls,*\n\n*And the light fails to return,*\n\n*Only one child, of mixed blood born,*\n\n*Can bring back our salvation.\" -- Unknown*\n\n__\n\nI remember hearing the old story when I was a child.  Teased by young and old alike for my half blood, the ancient story was ever present in my life.  As if I hadn't heard it before; each person who retold the ancient tale of the endless dark was convinced that they were more clever than the last for thinking of it.  But they always quick to add, that my older brother would have quite a burden if the old story ever proved to be reality.  Some were also quick to add that it could never be our tainted family line that would be responsible for bringing about any sort of \"salvation\".  \n\nI tended to agree.  My orc blood certainly hadn't brought about any luck for our family.  If anything, it had only made things worse.  Merchants charged us more, the tavern made us sit in a special section so that the regulars wouldn't be tempted to stare, and I often felt like it might be better for our family to just find a new place to live.\n\nNot that there was really any other place we could go, that is.  After my father left us, mother traveled to many towns, just looking for one that would tolerate us at all.  She was mocked, disparaged, and once, even spat upon for merely asking a question.  She wasn't the most beautiful of orcs, not many were, but humans with their disdain were the better alternative, even with the poor treatment.  The orc clans only promised death for her crime of marrying outside her race.\n\nSo we settled in a town that would have us, and prepared to live our our days just making ends meet and keeping each other company as best as we could.  But the old story followed us, and on occasion, my brother would take a moment to remind people that they ought not treat us so poorly, or he might not bring the light back.  What reason would he have, after all, when the world was a cold and dark place to him already, even with the light?\n\nI could tell that he kept that knowledge close to his heart, and as we grew older, I watched my brother turn colder and more distant.  Even though he wouldn't talk about it, I knew he was resentful of the fact that he had to step up and help take care of our family, instead of ever having hope of having his own.  He was the man of the house, in a society where men were often valued above the women.  And his half-blood often afforded him the lowest seniority in town, despite his demonstrated intelligence and skill with a hammer.  Mother and I helped him when we could, but as time went on, her strength began to fade, and my attention had never really been on reality, so that help was very limited and often not present at all.  He scolded me when my mind would roam elsewhere; it was true, I preferred learning and daydreaming to any sort of physical work.  Not the best assistant a blacksmith could have, in his opinion.\n\nSo I spent my days, looking forward to getting my hands on a book, and reading what I could, hiding from people in town and my family in almost equal measures.  The day I found the book with the supposed prophecy was not really a memorable one, but I remember being pleased that I could finally read it for myself.\n\nThat fateful morning when the sun didn't rise, I recall running to the window, seeing the darkness, and then waking my mother and brother up frantically.  They told me to go back to sleep, that I'd just woken up early, but I had a sinking feeling that I had not, in fact.  Once more hours had passed, and it was clear that the light had left us, fear rattled my stomach as I glanced at my brother.\n\nIn the pale light of the candle, I could see that his fantasy was coming true.  He would deny the world its light, and he would do so with pleasure.  In his haste, we dressed and went into town, to see what was happening there.\n\nA large crowd had gathered in the center of the city, near the town hall.  Citizens were holding large torches aloft to light the area, and voices could be heard rising in anger and panic.  When we arrived, one by one, the voices started to silence, and then a great murmur arose from the crowd as it seemed that everyone had stopped to remember the prophecy at the same time.  As the mayor gestured toward us, a path cleared through the crowd, and I hesitatingly followed my brother toward the center.\n\n\"Save us!\"\n\n\"Bring back the light!\"\n\n\"End this curse!\"\n\nVoices started up again, threatening to deafen my ears, but my brother raised his hand to the sky and then pointed around at the crowd, stopping on those speaking, until everyone had fallen silent again.\n\n\"You ask me to save you?  Those who have treated me like I was nothing since the day I arrived here?  Now that you need me, suddenly I am to do something for you--for all of you, as if we're good friends and care about one another?\n\n\"No,\" he said.  \"This is something I will not do.  This world can rot in darkness, and you have only yourselves to blame.\"\n\nHe lowered his arm to his side, and looked down at me.  For the first time in longer than I can remember, he smiled.  It was genuine, despite his harsh words, and left me feeling more confused and conflicted than I had ever been before.\n\nThen he grabbed his chest, gasping.  There, jutting out from his ribs were two arrows, one near to his heart, and an expanding circle of blood began to appear through his shirt.  He fell to the ground, and drew his last breath, while the crowd looked around for his attacker.\n\nWhen I raised my eyes, I saw my mother, holding her bow in her hands, another arrow drawn, and aimed at me.  As I met her gaze, she lowered her bow.\n\n\"It is not my son who can bring back the light...\" \n\nAll at once, I felt many eyes upon me as I continued to stare at my mother.  She'd never once mentioned the prophecy to either of us, and I was at a complete loss as to what to do.  Fighting back tears for my brother, and anger at my mother, I clenched my fists together and stood my ground as she steadily approached me.\n\nHer voice was low, so that only I could hear her, \"Do you want darkness to remain?  Or do you wish for the light to return?  The choice is yours.\"\n\nI did the only thing I could.  I knelt to the ground and wept.  I cried for my brother, and myself.  For this world, with all it's cruelty and hardships, and it's mysteries and wonders.  Nothing more had I wanted than to just be part of the very world that had shunned me, and for an instant I imagined what my brother had wanted.\n\nThe very fact that he had wanted to be part of the world, and treated like everyone else so very much impressed upon my heart that no, he wasn't evil.  He was desperately in love with the world, and terribly jealous and bitter he couldn't have it as he wanted.  To my immediate horror, I could relate to his plight, but at the same time, I realized that if we wanted to be part of this world so desperately, it must be because there was good to be found there... somewhere, even if that meant I'd never find it.\n\nMy voice was just a whisper, and I closed my eyes, blocking out the dark reality surrounding me.  \"I wish to bring back the light...\"\n\nAs mysteriously as it had come, the darkness was undone by the glorious light.  People fell to their knees, some crying, others screaming, but the world was silent for me, as I searched my mother's unreadable face for the answers to my many questions.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388733560","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceg5on2","link_id":"t3_1u9lp2","name":"t1_ceg5on2","parent_id":"t3_1u9lp2","retrieved_on":1431778554,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":8}

{"archived":true,"author":"Koyoteelaughter","body":"**(Part 3)**\n\nIt wasn't working. Fearing frostbite, I surrendered to the need and necessity and pulled the Hot Hands heating packet from the pocket of my coat. It was my last one. I opened it, applying it to my foot. The oxidizing iron went to work warming my frozen appendage. I kept it in place until it no longer produced any heat. I slipped it under my back and tried to milk the last vestiges of warmth from it. My foot was saved, but I still had six hours to go before first light. I pulled the blankets close and left my breathing hole once more. I woke off and on all throughout the night, waking with a shout as the nightmare of the fire intruded itself time and time again.\n\nIt was three thirty when next I woke. Outside the wind had died. The sleet was done and the sky had cleared. The moon had come out from behind the clouds, and the trailer was glowing as a result of its pleasure. Somewhere beyond the creek, the coyotes were laughing. Their mother, the moon, had decided to show herself. Somewhere out there, they ran in their little circles and called to her. *Look at me mommy. See what I can do.*\n\nI lay there for a long time, shivering so hard my teeth chattered and clacked. I had no ability to make them stop. I couldn't understand why they were laughing. The cold was horrible and cruel. How could they find joy in this winter waste land? I pulled the blankets close and tried to shut out the sound of their rejoicing, but even in sleep, my mind wondered at their mystery. \n\nI woke twice more that night, and by the time of my second wakening, I had given up. I was crying. Not for my pain, but for the futility that was my life. I was broken. Life, as impossible as I thought it was, had broken me. I didn't care. I actually toyed with the idea of crawling out of bed and going down to the creek one last time. It would only take a few minutes of being submerged for the cold water to finish me off. I lay awake until the alarm clock sounded.\n\nI dressed hurriedly, slipping on long johns and blue jeans, three pair of socks and my boots, three t-shirts, two button up shirts and my winter coat. My feet burned inside my leather boots. I pushed the door away, letting it fall to the side. I didn't care anymore. I marched across the field, my eyes going to the glowing horizon. The morning cold bit my flesh with wicked teeth. I crossed the fence, and followed the cord to JoDan's trailer.\n\nThe car wouldn't start. I got out, raised the hood and sprayed a mist of ether into the carburetor. I climbed in and tried it once more. It finally started, spurting to life. A moment later, it was dead again. I repeated the process and soon, it was roaring to life once more. I kept the engine revving till the motor started to warm up. I tried the defroster, but it was working intermittently. It wouldn't defrost my windshield. I could leave because I couldn't see. \n\nI climbed out of the car and shouted at the forest, directing my fury toward the horizon. There were no words or meaning. I poured my rage out in that scream. While the last of my scream echoed through the forest, the sun berthed in the east. The bite in the air disappeared immediately. It was like an answer. I climbed back inside the car and struck the dash. The defroster started to work. A short time later, my windshield was clear. I turned the car around and headed into town for work.\n\nI had an epiphany during that drive; short of death, that night was the worst night of my life. It would probably always be the lowest night too. It was the night; the night I broke. By contrast, every day of my life after that night could only be better. It was also the night I heard the coyotes laughing. I took that as my moniker, and the moral of the story that is my life.\n\nEven in our darkest hour, there is always an opportunity to find joy. The coyotes found it. I can too.\n\nI wrecked my car twenty minutes later. I'm still here.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388736682","downs":0,"edited":"1388758370","gilded":0,"id":"ceg6gri","link_id":"t3_1u9acx","name":"t1_ceg6gri","parent_id":"t1_ceg6gbl","retrieved_on":1431778922,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"javi720","body":"Debris was dwindling, the pokecenter was no more.  A charred up Luminose City sign just hanging on for dear life gave its final breath. Clunk. There were severed pokemon bodies and poketrainers everywhere, some indistinguishable from the next. The professor ran as fast as he can from the parked taxi a block away. When he finally reached Ash it finally hit him all at once. The professor crashed to his knees, whimpering, crying and murmuring all at once. He could have prevented it but it was too late now. \nAsh nowadays was known for his new gym in LC. There was quite a bit of opposition from the other trainers, but just a bit of dissatisfaction. The real hate spawned out Cafe Olive who was known to be nefarious enough to make team rocket and team flare look like children. \nIt had been unbeknownst to Ash that this group was harvesting pokemon organs. Ash being the brazen boy that is known around the city got too close on his first visit to Cafe Olive. He introduced himself and said they were welcome anytime to his gym.  The bodyguard made an offhand remark about Raichu and nothing was ever the same. The first attack that the group did on Ash was to delay the buidling of his gym for as long as possible. The typical intimidation of the workers, making parts deliveries go missing, and lastly trashing the work site anytime they had a chance. Ash would not back down, he had faced threat all his life. The first thing Ash did was to throw a big party for the town. He had announced that he had been careless in his planning and that he would need the town to come help him build his gym. The fact that Ash did not acknowledge the group was what angered them the most. The day of the rebuild Ash's wife, Molly, told him that it was not too late to take this to the Pokemon High Council. Ash had never seen eye to eye with the council as they too were political in their approach and things never seemed to get done. In addition Ash was skeptical that the earnings the council was showing were legitimate to any degree. So he went about his way anyway. Molly had been the one that alerted the professor a week ago. Proffesor Oak's safari had taken longer than anticipated and he got the message too late. \nThe crowd was gathered round, cheering and ready to work. For a few hours the work was nonstop and the smiles were cheek to cheek. Some trainers had brought their pokemon to sing to them to pass the time. Others brought them to help with the build. Around lunchtime a tinted car appeared and a message was left behind. It said: \"You have five minutes to disperse.\" Ash got on a crate and said: \"All my life I have been fighting against the oppressive. There are always people that let the malice enter their heads like it's a form of defeat. Well, not me. Not now and not ever. Those of you that wish to leave feel free, and those who want to stay behind, do this not only for yourself but for the future of  this city.\" A few trainers left but only because they had children to think of. The work went on for ten minutes, and no sign of the group was seen. Relieved Ash called Molly to tell her that everything was going to be alright and that the voice of the people had spoken. Right as he said this Ash looked out the window to see tinted truck parked infront of the loading area. Ash came out and started yelling at the driver. There was no response. Ash looked at the bed of the truck to find a tarp. Ash lifted the tarp with no hesitation. Afar someone took a picture of Ash's face in disbelief. There were explosives covering the full length of the truck bed. The blast went off without a hitch, the trainers working the front of the building got the worst of it. A few in the back would be paralyzed for life and all the pokemon were gone, as most tried to shield their trainers from the blast. Luminous City had just lost their beacon of light.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388776673","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceghnj2","link_id":"t3_1ub9h9","name":"t1_ceghnj2","parent_id":"t3_1ub9h9","retrieved_on":1431784263,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

{"archived":true,"author":"Will_Write_For_Karma","body":"I could hear the sound of a struggle off in a distance, wings beating against the floor and each other. Suddenly, the struggle stopped, and the only thing that could be heard was the sc#BADWORDS# of claws being dragged across the floor. *Looks like the Sheriff's got another victim*, I thought, a chill running through my bars. *I just hope he's kinder to this one than he was to Archie.*\n\nThey appeared suddenly out of the gloom, a pair of The Sheriff's cronies, big old macaws colored different shades of greens and blues, carrying a tiny white bird between their claws. The bird couldn't have been more than five, six inches from beak to tail. His translucent talons, which seemed barely strong enough to wrap around a tree branch, dragged across the ground, and his pure white feathers were stained crimson by the blood that leaked from his wounds. *He never stood a chance, a little guy like him.* But they always had to try.\n\n\"Well, howdy-do, Sheriff!\" I said as they dumped him on the ground in front of me. \"What'd this here low-lyin', two-timin', yellow-bellied, garbage-eatin' --\"\n\n\"Shut up, simpleton!\" The Sheriff screeched, fluttering to the ground next to the white bird. \"If I wanted to listen to your mindless squeaking, I would have said so!\"\n\nThe Sheriff was a fearsome bird, a huge Scarlet Macaw, with wickedly sharp claws and a beak that he honed every day with a stick. His cronies liked to say that the scarlet color of his feathers came from the blood of the \"criminals\" that he dealt his justice to. I liked to think that the blood from his victims was what had driven him insane, his victim's memories forever etched into his plumage. It appeared that he'd be getting a fresh coat soon.\n\nHe peered down at his prey, his beak an inch from the white bird's eye. The little bird opened up his good eye, saw curved death staring him right in the face, and pushed himself backward with a squawk of terror. The Sheriff laughed and placed a foot on the little bird. \"So, vermin, are you ready to confess to the robbery of the Treetown Federal Bank?\"\n\nThe little bird shuddered, a look of defeat in his eyes, and quietly muttered, \"Yes.\"\n\nThe Sheriff's feathers ruffled in pleasure. \"Good, good,\" he murmured, slowly taking his foot off of the bird and turning around. \"Might be I'll let you go, since you were so brave to confess.\"\n\nA note of hope could be heard in the little bird's voice as he spoke. \"Really?\"\n\nThe Sheriff laughed again. \"No,\" he said as he turned around, grabbed the bird, and flung him back into me. I could feel his body slam against my bars and fall to the ground.\n\nHis cronies laughed as The Sheriff closed the cage door and peered at the small, huddled form on the ground shivering in fear. A gleam appeared in his eye as he said, \"This one won't cause much trouble. He already sang like a canary for us, and I don't think there's much singing left in him. But if he does try to escape, make sure to tell me, and I'll be sure to deal him the proper justice.\" With one last glance, The Sheriff flew off into the gloom, his cronies huge shadows next to him. \n\nI looked at the little white bird on the ground and felt a stab of empathy. *He won't last a month.* \"So, sonny, what's yer name?\"\n\nThe little bird struggled to his feet. \"Polly,\" he muttered dismally.\n\n\"Well, Polly, yer gonna have a dandy of a time here. The Sheriff may seem like a tough ol' fella, but on the inside he's all for supportin' the law and dealin' swift and sure justice.\" *If you're lucky.* \"Ye'll get along great here, so long as ye jest do what the Sheriff asks ya to do.\"\n\nPolly blinked his good eye. \"And if I don't?\"\n\nI could hear Archie's screams reverberating through my memory, shaking my bars. I had to remember what The Sheriff had done. I had to wait, to play his games and believe his lies, because eventually - be it weeks, months, even years - there would be a chance to repay him for the \"justice\" that he had dealt. But until then...\n\n\"Well, sonny, jest make sure ye do.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388785838","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceglvul","link_id":"t3_1u92ye","name":"t1_ceglvul","parent_id":"t3_1u92ye","retrieved_on":1431786400,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

He bore a thick, disheveled head of hair, and a thin beard that sporadically inhabited his face. He gazed upwards towards the sky. The open roofed shed was consumed with the light of the sun above. The wooden walls creaked and moaned with the rise of the wind. His hair moved in the air. He looked down towards his toes and the tattered ends of his pants. Loneliness gripped him as a snake grips its prey. It wound its bleak hands over his face and crushed his soul.

{"archived":true,"author":"Koyoteelaughter","body":"\"Beneath the wall. Three black stones and stop. Pray, stay, and see.\" He shook his head in confusion. *Why'd I say that?* A candle, black and short, flared brightly, the flame standing nearly a foot above the wax. His vision swam. He held his hands up to block the light.\n\n\"Where am I?\" He asked the darkness. At least, it looked like darkness. The candle flared again and once more his vision swam. His brain couldn't seem to focus.\n\n\"The thirty, the twenty, and the goat. Pray, stay, and see.\" He rubbed his head in frustration. *What does that mean?* The candle was giving him a headache. The light seemed brighter than a normal candle, like the arc of a welder. He started to open his mouth to speak again, but changed his mind. Everytime he talked the candle flared, causing his brain to hurt.\n\nHe had been a mason once, sometime in his past. When he could not say. He just remembered laying stone. He also remembered how to lay the stone. He surveyed the room with an expert eye. The stone wasn't put together overly well. The stones were crooked with sloppy mortar, like the places the immigrants built. He studied the walls closer. There were words written on many of stones. He tried to read one of them. \n\nThe candle flared brightly once more, and once more he looked away in pain. His vision swam and the pain in his head felt like he was being tortured with a vise. \n\n\"I demand to know why I am here?\" His voice echoed through the room. No one answered, but when he opened his mouth to ask again, the candle flared and he collapsed. He beat upon the floor with his fist, fighting the pain with rage.\n\n\"The hidden door will open. Follow me three left, two right, one forward, three left, two left, one forward, leap the last.\" He didn't know why he felt compelled to spout the nonsensical information. It was like he had a mental disability he couldn't fight. \"Leap the last. Yes. I'm sure.\"\n\n\"For the love of G--\" The pain took him to the floor. It wasn't the pain the candle caused. It was worse. So much worse. His stomach felt like he'd swallowed hot coals, and they were burning him from the inside out. His head felt like it was being pulled apart. He raked at his face with his own nails, digging deep bloody furrows in his flesh. \"I'm sorry.\" He shouted. The pain continued for several long agonizing moments, but it did grow more manageable, as if his apology had been taken into consideration.\n\nHe repeated several more lines of the same ambiguous crap and suffered it.\n\n\"No more,\" he said finally, fighting the compulsion to respond. He tried to knock over the candle, but his hand passed right through it like it wasn't even there. That gave him pause. The urge to spout more nonsense came over him.\n\n\"No more.\" He snapped. The candle flared, but he accepted the pain and fought his way through it. \"No more!\" He shouted. For a brief moment, he thought he saw someone sitting to his right.\n\n\"Twenty steps. Stop. Turn--NO MORE!\" He roared, breaking through the compulsion. He blinked in surprise. There was a man sitting to his right and another sitting to his left and his left and his left. He was surrounded by men and women. They were all wearing robes. He saw the candle dim and realized the men and women were tired.\n\n\"Who are you people?\" He demanded. The candle flared, but it was half hearted. The pain was more of an annoying throb this time. There was a box of matches nearby. He reached for one. His hand sparked just shy of them.\n\n\"The man before him spoke. \"What is the combination of the labyrinth's seventh level?\" It was a question, but he delivered it like it was a command. The compulsion to speak was weak and barely registered.\n\n\"Who are you?\" He asked, reaching for the candle again. He felt some resistance, but still his hand passed through it. The flame dimmed even lower.\n\n\"We have to stop. We can't match his power much longer.\" A woman to his far left announced on the edge of panic. He looked at the writing on the wall. He couldn't read it yet, but the harder he concentrated the clearer they became. The words were meaningless, but each word was followed by a symbol he was familiar with. The all seeing eye. He remembered this symbol. It had been important to him. Why? He could not fathom.\n\n\"Who are you?\" He asked again, reaching for the matches. His hand sparked against the barrier again, but after a couple more tries, one of the men to the right collapsed. He seized the match in his hand and rolled the squared edges of the match between his finger and thumb. He looked at the candle and seem to understand immediately what he was supposed to do with the match. He scratched the match head with his thumb and felt better when the men and women gasped in fear.\n\n\"Who are you?\" The man before him said a word and the candle flared, but the man with the match no longer cared. The compulsion was more of a hunger pang than and urge now. \"I'm only asking once more, he said, bring the match toward the dying candle's wick.\n\n\"Send him away. Do it now. Send him away!\" Several of the people in attendance shouted, dropping their pious decorum. \"Send him--\"\n\nHe set the flame to the wick of the black candle. The confusion vanished. He no longer wondered who he was. He no longer sat in the center of a room. He was no longer confused by the writing on the walls. He was no longer confined to the pentagram on the floor. He smiled a slow cruel smile filled with hundreds of sharp teeth and flared his leathery wings. Fire blossomed from one hand while a wicked forked trident appeared in his other. The men and women screamed and trampled each other in the rush to flee the evil they had summoned.\n\nHe cackled with glee and rushed forward to do the Devil's work. The arrogant man who'd sat before him pulled out a ceremonial dagger and plunged it into his own chest. The demon grabbed his arm and stopped him before the tip of the iron blade could pierce his heart.\n\n\"You die, when I let you.\" He rumbled, rasping out the words one by one. The man screamed, the demon laughed, and people died. \"Only a fool invites the devil in.\" The demon sang, sinking his trident into the back of a portly man. \"Every child knows that.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388794796","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cegpsor","link_id":"t3_1uaxvu","name":"t1_cegpsor","parent_id":"t3_1uaxvu","retrieved_on":1431788225,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"virbirations","body":"I really didn't know why they picked me to do it. Maybe because it was that I was the new guy, or maybe it was because everyone else opted out because I was sick that day. The information I received was both blatant and blunt, but seemingly sickly resting in the same manilla envelope that had oftentimes held good news. This time, it was different. Headquarters called me in and instructed me the day prior. I was greeted by an elder man who had death in his eyes and wrinkles over every visible flesh area on his body. He was grim and solemn, and didn't look me in the eyes as I left. He gave warnings and re-confirmed to me that I was going to be the only one going in on this mission. It was practically suicide- but the haz-mat gear I had obtained gave me a strong chance against contracting the new contagion. \n\nThe family lived in a spacious home deep in the rockys. The architecture plans, family pictures, and backgrounds were given about each member. They seemed like a pretty normal family, a lot like my own, even. It was a shame that it'd emerged and happened to them, but at least it occured in isolation.\n\nIt happened on a brisk morning. The nature around the house held it's breath, as if waiting to see this go down. The door to their house finally gave to my kicks after a few strong blows, caving and creaking as it swung on it's hinges. The house was utterly silent, but not sick like the envelope. I loaded a new round into my cartridge, and surveyed the area. The house was contemporary and modern, hard wood floors kissing egg-shell walls in most places. From where I was, I had a full view of the living room, stair case to upstairs, and spacious kitchen. On this floor sat the master bed room and stairs down, also. I decided to head to the master bed first, because that was probably where the mother and father were located. Silently, I slipped across the floor, tip-toeing and checking my back every few seconds. As the door neared, I kicked that in, too, only to find an empty room. There was no sign of sickness as I quickly scanned the room- everything looked pristine. After checking the closets and master bath, I retraced my steps and decided to climb the stairs. On both sides of the stairs hung family photos on walls- I stopped for a brief second to check them out. The two youngest and one eldest's school pictures hung there, along with family portraits and antique photographs. I shook my head to rid any emotional connection and continued up the stairs. An eerie sense of still wavered over my senses as I traveled down the hall. Finally, I reached the end room, and peaked inside. The 5 members of the family sat huddled in a corner, hugging each other, eyes closed and unmoving, as if they didn't know of my presence. Finally, after a few moments of studying their faces and making sure I trusted my protective equipment, I managed a sentence. \"Hello. My name is John and I was sent here from the Government.\" The family turned to me, sadness in their eyes and quivering in their bodies. \"My god, John, please, no.\" The father spoke up, shrouding his family with his arms. \"Listen to me, and listen quick- we have a misunderstanding.\" And so I did, at least for the time being. These people were supposedly very dangerous, but their sense of fear was overwhelming. \"The government sent you to kill me because I found the cure for this disease which the government has been keeping in their labs. They have been tampering with it to use next year either as bio warfare or to control the masses. They didn't want a cure because they wanted death.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388802501","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cegsxc8","link_id":"t3_1t3m72","name":"t1_cegsxc8","parent_id":"t3_1t3m72","retrieved_on":1431789786,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

She captured the setting sun, reflected on the cold ocean. She couldn't wait to send the pictures to him. He had sent her the camera for Christmas, along with a book on how to take pictures properly with a DSLR. He had took pictures of himself, their friends, and their family. (And some naughty ones of himself, but he hid those just for her). She missed her husband. This was the longest they've been away since they've been together...but she had to go. She continued snapping away, checking the exposure, the focal length, shutter speed... she captured the blue sky melt into purple and the purple melt into the dark blue of the night. She missed him so much and longed for his embrace. She imagined his strong arms guiding her and showing her the way as she snapped pictures of the stars peeking out. She couldn't wait to go back home to him.\n\nShe never came home. He stood there in the beach, over looking the Atlantic. It was freezing. The sea breeze was salty and it stung his face.

Tonight was lasagna night! \"Mom, Dad, Phoebe, dinner is ready, come on down!\" he shouted from the bottom of the stair well. The other family members lazily slouched their ways down to the table, silence was in the air, you could tell no one wanted to be together today. Edward didn't mind one bit however, he was just glad everyone was home tonight, for he had a special announcement! \n\nThe family took their plates and began eating at the table. Edward was the first to take his food, and he hastily ate every bit of it. He was anxious and very nervous. Phoebe took her last bite and looked up from her plate. Dad was adjusting a napkin that lay on his empty plate, and Mom was starting to stand. \n\n\"Mom wait!\" Edward shouted.\n\n\"What is it sweet heart?\"\n\n\"Actually, I have an announcement to make, to the family.\" Edward stood. His eyes passed over every member of his family, everyone aside from his father showed anticipation in their eyes. He glanced over at the wall that bore a metal cross with the words *'God is great, god is good'*. Suddenly, Edward felt flushed and dizzy. He staggered back and thought hard about what he was going to do. \n\n\"Everything okay sweetheart?\" Edwards mom asked.\n\"Yes, it's just,\" Edward began.\n\n\"Im gay.\" \n\nThe air grew cold and Edward felt the stares from the table. Jaw agape, Edward's sister took her plate and quickly retreated to the kitchen, her mother following close behind. \n\n\"What the hell do you mean you're gay?\" Edwards father spoke in a low groan. \n\n\"What the hell do you mean you're gay?\" he spoke again, but in a yell. \n\n\"Edward goddammit answer me!\" tears swelling in his eyes. \n\nEdward dropped to his knees, \"Dad, I- I'm so sorry. I just,\" Edward was interrupted by his father's fist lunging straight for his chest. He felt the air leave his stomach and began to cough. Another blow was sent towards Edward's neck, and his dad began to choke him. \"You'll burn in hell you gay bas#BADWORDS#! #BADWORDS# you! How could you do this you bas#BADWORDS#!\" screamed from his father. Edward's mother ran in and tried to pull him off, but the adrenaline made him much to strong. Blow after blow the threats and screams filled Edward's dizzy head. Edward felt another blow into the side of his head, and he knew this was it. He was much to small to fight back, and he'd already been hurt too much. His mom's tears flowing to the floor like waterfalls. The sister, crying from the kitchen. Edward took it all in, \"look what you've done you #BADWORDS#\" echoed in his mind \"why couldn't you just keep quiet #BADWORDS#. Now you've ruined your family.\" The onslaught ceased and Edward's father stepped away from his almost lifeless body. His mom holding Edward, like a baby, apologizing for what his father had previously done. He tried to say something, but it was inaudible. Edward's head fell back in his mother's arms. She held his battered body, crying, screaming, wishing this all would be over. \n\nEdit:Spelling","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388810146","downs":0,"edited":"1388810413","gilded":0,"id":"cegvww2","link_id":"t3_1ucwks","name":"t1_cegvww2","parent_id":"t3_1ucwks","retrieved_on":1431791174,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Vanguard and I were joined at birth. Each Union captain is chosen in utero, and an AI is created based on our genetic structure. Vanguard has been with me my entire life. It has been a small, fast scout ship, a vast battleship, a supply freighter..\"\n\n\"Which was terrible! The stink of those cows will haunt me!\"\n\n\"shut up Van. We both know you can't smell anything, you don't have any olfactory sensors. It has been my constant companion and best friend. We are linked via implants in my frontal lobe, we communicate instantaneously, it can utilise my eyes and other senses to gather data\"\n\n\"I told you I could smell those cows\"\n\n\"Shut up Van!\"\n\nKirk grinned \"I see he has a sense of humor\"\n\n\"Not 'he' captain. It. Vanguard is neither male, female or trah. It knows it is a machine. But just because it has a brain made of Dilithium rather than neurons does not make it any less sentient than you or I.\"\n\nThe trip back to Earth took no more than a week. During that time, Captains McLaren and Kirk became well acquainted. Vanguard had made fast friends in Commander Spock and Lieutenant Commander Scott, beating Spock at Kal-toh and discussing the nature of Dilithium and Federation technology with Scott. Vanguard was towed along by the tractor beam from the Enterprise. Upon arrival at the San Francisco Fleet Yards, Vanguard was placed in drydock and pored over by Federation engineers and scientists. They showed a great interest in the tear drive, but once it was discovered it damaged subspace, yet did not utilise it, they decided the risk was not worth the reward and discontinued their research. The crew was left in hibernation. McLaren decided this experience did not need to be shared by the Vanguard's novice crew and extremely xenophobic political officer.\n\nThe day Vanguard was due to leave, a small fleet of hostile ships was detected at extreme range, attacking a Federation colony. McLaren contacted Kirk.\n\n\"Jim. I have heard you are mobilising to defend the outpost. Let us take care of it for you, as a token of our extreme gra#BADWORDS#ude. With all of our systems powered up, we can show you what a Union ship can really do.\"\n\n\"Acknowledged Captain McLaren. I have relayed your request to Starfleet Command and they have allowed it. Happy hunting. We will follow you as backup, and captain, it has been a pleasure to know you these last few weeks. Kirk out\"\n\nMcLaren smiled and settled into the command chair, information flowed into his vision, co-ordinates, ship status, star charts, weapons systems, targeting scanners, everything he needed to know available in a small corner of his vision.\n\n\"Okay Van. Take us out of the shipyard, half throttle. Once we are at a safe range, open a tear and get us to that outpost. I want the armour powered, kinetics, missiles and drones ready to fire, and let's pay back the favour the Federation did for us\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, Captain\" Vanguard chirped.\n\nThe chemical rockets at the stern of the vessel fired, leaving a trail of luminous green plasma. Vanguard accelerated at an astonishing rate. Once it was safely out of range of the planet, the armour powered up, a web of red fiery lines encircled the craft. Flat muzzles emerged from concealing doors in the hull, likewise pylons covered with angry, black missiles emerged from the left and right sides of the ship. Vanguard grew larger and flatter, changing shape for the most efficient heat radiation and smallest possible profile. The tear drive engaged, a ribbon of white energy emerged from the nose of the ship, concentrating on a point just in front of the bow. A blinding flash and a rip in space opened, through which was a grey nothing. The chemical engines fired again and Vanguard flew into the tear, vanishing in an instant. The tear stayed open for exactly four minutes and twenty seconds before collapsing.\n\nSeconds after entering the tear outside Earth orbit, Vanguard arrived at the Federation colony. Kirk had said the attackers were \"Ramulans\" and that they were fierce fighters with ships that could turn invisible. Four Ramulan ships were in orbit around the planet.\n\n\"no bigger than Krull Suicideships, Bruce. This will be fun\" Vanguard sounded happy to be back in combat.\n\nThe Ramulan ships were slow and unweildy, their weapons unable to follow quickly enough. Vanguard flew rings around them. Heavy kinetic rounds slammed into hulls, throwing the ships off course, drones attached themselves to the sensors and blinded them. Missiles bored through the hull, searching for the largest power source they could find. In three minutes, Vanguard had destroyed the four Ramulan vessels and secured the colony.\n\n\"Okay Vanguard. Let's head home. I want you to scramble all logs from the time we emerged into Federation space. The Union doesn't need to know about the Federation. Overwrite with garbage, make out there was a disruption with the tear drive that damaged the logs.\"\n\n\"I understand. I will make the necessary adjustments. No point scaring the warmongers back home, is there?\"\n\n\"Too right. Open the tear Van. The next thing I want to see is Alpha Station.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388826326","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceh0rv9","link_id":"t3_1uccwk","name":"t1_ceh0rv9","parent_id":"t1_cego1q7","retrieved_on":1431793593,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"lockleon","body":"This won't be seen by many as it's pretty late, but thought I would post anyway. I don't write much but am making a point to do moreso as of this year. Would love to hear your criticisms. :)\n\n------------------\n\nAt 12:00:03 AM, the first of January, 2014, Alex kissed the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life while colours exploded in the night sky. Her name was Annika, or Anastasia or something like that, and she was literally flawless. Her almost symmetrical face was only disrupted by a strand of saffron hair falling to the right and obscuring her large, deep emerald eyes. Her torso waved from the swelling of her breasts in to her plump stomach and back out again for her hips. Her toned arms and legs looked as though their length had been calculated by some complex computer algorithm. Even her posture was damn perfect. Alex had no idea why an ancient deity of beauty would incarnate as a human woman, place her mouth against his mouth and move her tongue around his tongue, as a crowd shouted “happy new year!” and cheered for him.\n\nThe doctor confirmed the diagnosis a week later. Alex noticed the initial symptoms when we woke up in the first afternoon of the new year, though he did not immediately recognise them as such. His acne, having plagued his face and back since middle school, looked rather clear that day. His haircut seemed to flatter his face particularly well, even if it was greying a few decades premature. Over the week he found his teeth looking straighter, his shoulders feeling broader, and his jawline becoming more pronounced. It was only after he noticed a dramatic increase in the size of his #BADWORDS# did he book an appointment with his doctor and feared the worst.\nThe doctor arranged an overnight blood test and rang the next morning, seven days into the new year, with the bad news. All the websites Alex looked at said the same thing as the television warnings: Aphrodisis was becoming an epidemic due to the new year’s celebrations and accompanying traditions. It seemed unfair to Alex. He was considerably intoxicated at the time and she was the one who turned to him and grabbed the side of his face. She had to know too, she was too hot. The average person would get about 6-8 months of life once infected with the virus, throughout which their appearance would slowly improve until they reach perfection and die. Recent innovations in antiviral therapy had increased life expectancy to around a year, and if you started out particularly ugly it could be extended for a few additional months. The doctor estimated 14 months remaining for Alex.\n\nWith his dreams for the future dashed, Alex quit his job as an IT support officer in March and found one as a model. The modeling industry was booming thanks to the aphrodisis epidemic. Companies were big money for patients and aphromodels were in huge demand. Plus the work was easy. Certainly more boring, but everything was. Your lust for life tends to diminish when you know it’s ending. His hair had stopped growing (and had regained its colour) entirely by now, he was a good seven inches taller than he was last December, and his chest bulged from under his skin with pectoral and abdominal muscles. He had stopped showering and ate five meals a day, never feeling satiated and never adding a kilogram.\n\nLeaving his job also had the unintended consequence of cutting all ties with anyone he considered a friend. No one at the agency would associate with him, knowing he was an aphro, and so he would keep quiet about his disease on the odd occasion he did meet someone new. This usually occurred at the bar down the road from his apartment, where he would drink all night but never feel anything more than a slight buzz. Women would approach him every night, and although he struggled through mundane conversation with them they would always compliment his natural charisma and confidence. He made a pact with himself never to engage too heavily with these women, lest they make the same mistake he did bringing in the new year. However one night in early June, while drinking a whiskey highball and feeling bitter about his conflicting life, he asked a girl whose name he never learned to take him back to her house and there they had sex. It had a been a year since he last had sex and found that his new physique lended itself to the experience. Having not slept that night, he quietly gathered his belongings before the sun rose and ran home, not stopping once in 40 minutes to catch his breath.\n\nWhile shooting an ad for a vodka brand, Alex got to talking to the woman whose role was to d#BADWORDS# over him in lust while he held a shot glass of water. Her name was Sarina. She had become infected in February when her husband cheated on her with an aphro and unknowingly passed it onto her. It resulted in their divorce. Sarina showed Alex a photograph of what had to be her mother: an older woman with grey hair, wrinkles around the eyes, skin sagging around her cheeks, the cracked lips of a smoker. \n“That’s me” she said. “Or rather, was me.” Sarina was 53 years old but passed as 25 with no troubles. “It’s what I always wanted, but not like this.”\n\nBy August, Sarina had moved into Alex’s apartment permanently. She would often talk of her old life – of her husband, her two sons and one daughter, her parents. Alex never felt his life was worth chatting about, but she would manage small bits out of him on occasions. They had sex twice a day, once at night before bed and again as soon as they woke up. She would cook for him and clean the house, and painted landscapes of parks, rivers, coffee shops, whatever she could bring to mind.  Alex would read biographies of famous celebrities, medieval warlords, cancer survivors, anything really. Material possessions became meaningless to him and he threw out things until the apartment was almost empty. Even the books he read he burned in the brazier on the balcony as soon as he finished them. He took all the photographs he had collected and placed them in a box labeled ‘mum’. The photographs were replaced by Sarina’s paintings, though he wanted to burn those as well.\n\nIn November they both left the modeling agency as they could no longer leave the apartment without being stared at and mocked. Their perfected bone structure, impeccable fitness and undeniable attractiveness meant they stood out in a crowd of perfectly ordinary people. Once Sarina had saved enough money for her children’s inheritance, they both quit the job and never left the apartment again. By that stage eating was purely a habit leftover from their old lives; their bodies were capable of sustaining themselves now, so it was not a problem when the food ran out. For Christmas, Sarina painted a portrait of Alex. He never told her how much he hated the painting because it was not a picture of him – it was a picture of aphrodisis.\n\nAlex never really cared for Sarina until the day she died. He was never able to rouse her from her sleep on the morning of December 29th and he cried in bed next to her beautiful, sublime corpse for the entire day. He phoned the hospital the next day and paramedics wheeled her out of the apartment covered by white blankets. Her death certificate said the cause of death was perfection.\n\nBecoming perfect scared Alex. Nothing was perfect, not the world, not God, nothing but Sarina. At 9:00 PM on December 31st, 2014, Alex sat on his balcony and watched the colours of the sky explode above a crowd of celebrators. He remembered Amanda or whatever her name was, and how flawless he thought she was a year ago. She too had reached perfection.  Looking back he could perfectly recall her in his memory, but not what he saw in her that night. He remembered her eyes that were too large for her head, a seaweed green that clashed with her pumpkin-coloured hair. He remembered the way her body protruded and enlarged at particular areas, but shrunk at others randomly. He sat there for hours with Sarina’s portrait of himself leaning against the wall in front of him. His face looked jagged and boney. Sarina had reached perfection and died, but no one else had the right to ever do the same. Awaiting midnight, Alex sat atop the wall his feet dangling over the edge. He could hear the jubilance of the crowd, laughing and screaming and then counting him down from 10. Once they reached “happy new year!” and cheered for him, Alex pushed himself off the wall and hit the concrete walkway below at 12:00:03 AM, the first of January, 2015.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388844908","downs":0,"edited":"1388845149","gilded":0,"id":"ceh3v2d","link_id":"t3_1u9b9r","name":"t1_ceh3v2d","parent_id":"t3_1u9b9r","retrieved_on":1431795044,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

For me, it's tough to deconstruct a romance if I can't write romance in the first place. I've always enjoyed Supernatural when it's on in the morning. I grew up on Scooby Doo, so a more serious and mature take on it was very entertaining.  I do enjoy that episode when they deconstruct slash fic and everything about the rest of the series. It's very meta.\n\nYeah, I'd pay to see a movie with 'nids'. Though my absolute favorite faction is the Death Korps of Krieg. The first Siege of Vraks imperial armor is straight out of the First World War. If only I had three thousand dollars just sitting around.\n\nWell that's nice! It was a really excellent prompt. I enjoy educated writing prompts. \n\nYeah, the feeling of helplessness is never a fun one. Reminds me of Doppler in Treasure Planet. \"Dangit, Jim, I'm an astronomer, not a doctor!

Not because of the company policy, or that he and everyone he worked and lived with were condemned to a slow and ugly death. All that he could deal with. But not Brenda dying. He still loved her, even after what happened between them. He told her earlier that day. \"Did you know? I never stopped loving you,\" he said. \"I knew,\" she replied, eyes pinned to the floor, \"but I didn't think I deserved you anymore.\" He took her in his arms then, both cursing and blessing her answer. He believed her, it was a typical Brenda statement. They spent the rest of the day lying down, locked in an embrace. They barely spoke in those hours, but their feelings caught up with lost time.\n\nTomorrow we'll be probably both be dead, Burt mused as he threw his empty glass into the shrubs, but these are our best moments yet.

If I did, I don't remember it.\n\nThe glass bowl has always been my world. The constraints of the glass learned to me by the time I was but a few days young.\n\nI grew up with my school. The elder Golds teaching us how to survive within the invisible walls. How to get to the food before anyone else, how to entertain the overlords so the wouldn't send you into the porcelain portal, how to hide from the blue scoop. \n\nBut alas, my day had come sooner than I expected. It was much more frightening than you would have anticipated. Than anyone could have possibly anticipated. I remember seeing the fear in the eyes of many friends who had been taken away to live in their own Glass Bowls with their own personal overlords.\n\nI never honestly thought it would be me though.\n\nSoon enough I was being pulled from the only home I had ever known, my air stricken from lungs as the water washed away below me. I fought and struggled in the blue scoop. And was more than grateful when I was dropped back into water. Sucking in that sweet sweet oxygen and looking around helplessly. This was not like my old home. The world around this new bowl was distorted, the water slightly tainted. I shot forward and slammed head first into a new invisible wall, one that gave way easily and was not nearly as strong as the old one.\n\nI could sense myself being moved within the walls. My new home being jostled around and transported to somewhere strange.\n\nSuddenly a giant face appeared in front of my clear and distorted prison. It scared the #BADWORDS# out of me, literally. There was silver sitting upon the white teeth. Its skin was rather tan and its hair was blonde and rather nice, I must say.\n\nSoon enough we arrived at their domain. I watched as they carried me to the second level of their home, and they placed me into what is now my lovely home. I have a castle, a lovely red and blue floor and wonderful foliage to play in whenever I like.\n\nI have watched my master grow over the last year and I in turn have grown with her. She has always treated me well and kept me fed healthily.\n\nI may not have lived as nature intended, but I lived well nonetheless. \n\n[-002](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1uclgs/wpeu_the_american_government_abolishes_all_paper/cegvxdy) ***Link to previous entry***","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388871254","downs":0,"edited":"1388964231","gilded":0,"id":"cehdldf","link_id":"t3_1uebxy","name":"t1_cehdldf","parent_id":"t3_1uebxy","retrieved_on":1431799698,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

Nothing lasted. I never felt a spark. \n\n\n\nThen my ex-boyfriend introduced me to his sister, Clarie.

She was,perfect, and I fell head-over-heels for her.\n\n\n\nI broke up with Clarie's brother, and fell even harder for her. I fell into a depression because I wasn't normal. Nobody would accept me, but my feelings were too real. I couldn't get over them. When my Dads found me passed out from a suicide attempt, I knew I had to tell them. After I had been treated, #BADWORDS#d, and put on medication, I figured myself out. I was straight. Clarie wasn't, but I'd find somebody.\n\n\n The day I came out, I was shaking. My Dads had never forced religion upon me, but I knew their standings on heterosexuals. I say my parents down and choked. Dad came and patted me on the back while my other Dad asked what was wrong.\n\n\n*You're unnatural.*\n\n\n*Everyone will hate you.*\n\n\nThoughts rushed through my head and I thought I was going to puke.

{"archived":true,"author":"chanceguy123","body":"A very unique take on the prompt which is also a sequel to another work of mine.  The elf narrates most of it.  The story KIND OF breaks the fourth wall talking to the reader until it turns into 2nd person.  Also, a note about verb usage if you don't mind small spoilers:\n\nThe elf is telling you this from a timeless place, where he has witnessed it all.  When he speaks directly to you, he talks about 2014 as the present, but it's long past for him.\n\n\nAuthor Notes: um... what?  This is... interesting...  You should get some sleep, self.\n\nSanta arrived back on base after losing his heat.  Flashes of what he had just done burned into his brain.  He was finally grasping the events of Christmas eve.  Scrambling for a pen and paper, he began writing down the events.\n\n\"Santa Claws and I went to fulfill the Christmas wish of a girl wanting daddy out of prison.  Claws rescued the dad but was shot down by police and prison guards.  The dad has been delivered.  I will deliver presents tonight.\"\n\n\nJanuary 4th, 2014.\n\n\nThe matches that sparked a new order throughout the North Pole were cast to flames not by Santa, but by his elves.  See, unknown to the outside world, the North Pole was a communist nation.  Years after the fall of communism, Santa \"revised\" the program and enlisted it.  The big man was no longer good and jolly.  He was fully evil.\n\nOn that day, January 4th of 2014, the day the revolution had been planned for the past 7 years, one little elf took matters into his own hands.  Banding together, he doused Warehouse 1 in gasoline and lit it up.  Fleeing to warehouse 2, the elf broke into the ba#BADWORDS#t, where they had been making guns out of what could have toys for the little boys and girls.  The work ethics of elves allowed them to take the materials that were reserved for next Christmas and fortify the base, making a training grounds, in just hours.\n\nThe mass numbers armed themselves.  Gre#BADWORDS#es, AKs, M4A1s, you name it, they were going to use it.\n\nBut how could Santa defend himself? He didn't have an army.  No, he did.  Half of the elves split with Santa and half worked for the revolution.  The fight was set to begin that day, and no one could prepare for what would happen, not even the mortals.\n\nYou see, when Immortals wage war, or even have little arguments, a war happens on earth that represents what is happening.  One side always represents good or evil.\n\nLet's take a flashback to World War Two.  What happened back then in the 40s was a clash of epic proportions.  Santa Claws had just come back from the depths of hell.  He brought his minions, gangs of which he had banded together for one purpose: taking over the Immortals.  Claws himself was a Defiant.  He was one of the Immortals that separated in the beginning of time, secluded himself, so to speak.  Claws was still different though.  He never liked to band together with other Defiants, almost as if he wanted to start his own faction or branch of the Immortals.\n\nSo, in the 40s, when World War Two rolled around, the embodiment of Claws is what you mortals referred to as Germany: The Nazi Party.  Claws was basically the Adolf Hitler.  Santa was of course part of the Allies; he actually fought in the war.\n\nBack to what happened in 2014, what we've learned here is:\n\nALL IMMORTAL ACTIONS HAVE MORTAL REPERCUSSIONS.\n\nSo, are you getting this yet, Mortal?\n\nYes, you.  I'm talking to you.  The reader.\n\nSomething is going to go down in the world of the Mortals.\n\nNow that Claws is dead, there's no leader for one side.  That means that someone unexpected is going to rise up show his true colors.\n\nAre you getting this now, Mortal?  What I'm telling you here is from the future.  You better be understanding this, because you have one chance to prevent this all...\n\n*Boom.* Another mortar shakes Santa's shelter.  Again and again.  Screams of terror and bloodcurdling sounds that could only be the sound of jugulars being ripped out one by one by invaders.  Heat that could only be the feeling of nervous sweat and heavy, red, jolly clothes.\n\nSanta gathered his men.  He gave them firearms, knowing they could use them and use them to kill.  The peacekeepers were already all dead.  Now was the time for action, and the only available opportunity they'd get for another day.\n\nFighting was just dying down.  Believing they had won, rebels sat down to rest, eat, and tend to their few wounded.  Santa sent stealthy groups to start, and waited to send an all out assault.\n\nThat's when the light machine guns started warming up.\n\nRows upon rows of innocent elves fighting for their leader loyally were mowed down.  It was almost as if the rebels were under mind control.  They didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that they were relentlessly killing neighbors, brothers, sisters and parents.\n\nVia radio, Santa's snipers began marking and taking out targets, focusing the ones that were on the LMGs.  After what could have been hours of fighting was done in minutes, Santa sent wave after wave of elves rushing in to murder rebels.\n\nWhat could Santa have done better to overpower the rebels so easily, even after taking out the LMGs?  The rebels certainly had time to finish eating and resting.\n\nIf you remember anything about mind control earlier, you might have guessed that.\n\nVia a button, Santa turned his loyal army into expendable killers on command, with great accuracy and no attention to pain.  The elves withstood bullets before being injured to the point of not being able to move anymore, without slight grunts whatsoever.  Santa was able to individually deactivate units, and he waited until they were dead to do so.\n\nElves were not mortals; they did not have the chance to regain life forces and heal up after near death as their soul tried to escape like immortals.  They just died like humans.  That made the war easy for both sides, not having to kill something that was already dead.\n\nJanuary 5th, 2:51 A.M.\n\nFighting came to a short lived close at 2 A.M.  Retreating for healing and food and rest, both sides made battle plans.  Which side had more casualties?  This time, it was the rebels, being overtaken by mind controlled elves and running out of ammo.  The controlled elves awoke as murderers for their cause, and that only raised morale...\n\nNews reports everywhere, throughout the entire world of the forming of a Middle Eastern Coalition and taking over resource rich parts of Africa and spreading all the way to China were rampant.  In the Mortal world, the repercussion was World War Three.  Although barely a day in fighting, the world was already devastated by the war.  Although no Geneva convention rules were broken, this was the worst world war in the known Multiverse.\n\nHey mortal, you had the chance to prevent this and you never interrupted me.  You never asked how.  You just let me carry on talking.\n\n\"Enough.\"  A voice you haven't heard in what sounds like years carries chills down your spine.  Could it be yours?\n\n\"Do you even know where you are, child?  You are in the depths of Hell right now.  I snagged you from the mortal world to speak to you.  Nothing you do matters here.  This is my playground,\" the voice narrating the story says.\n\n\"It's all clear to me now.  And what my refreshed mind is telling me is that I will kill your ass right now.\"  Seeing arms and legs move, you feel yourself leaping out of your seat and putting hands around the nearest neck, which happens to be the owner of the voice.\n\n\"I am important here!  I don't need you!  I was educating you, you worthless...\"\n\n\"You are just a butthurt, shellshocked elf.  You just want to take your rage from destroying both the Immortal world and MY WORLD out on me,\" you say, or at least you think YOU said it.\n\nFinally killing the elf, you wake up in an interrogation cell in a facility.  Less than ten minutes after getting back into the real world, a small booming sound reaches closer.  You realize it's not just one sound, but a quickly moving string of sounds, like a chain reaction.  It's a familiar sound, from your last service in the armed forces.\n\nPlastic explosives.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388916573","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cehscaf","link_id":"t3_1uffu1","name":"t1_cehscaf","parent_id":"t3_1uffu1","retrieved_on":1431806863,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

I’m sure you’ve heard of American Psycho—that book, while fictional, does a stellar job of portraying—“\n\n“I’m sorry, what?” The chair’s become too uncomfortable to sit in silence anymore. “You’re saying I’m a real-life Patrick Bateman?”\n\n“Well, no, you—you don’t seem to have any, uh, murderous tendencies, but, given what you’ve described to me—the boredom, the inability to connect with others, the way you carry yourself—“\n\n“The way I carry myself? Come on, doc, you can’t be telling me that because I like to laugh and make people laugh, and because I understand how to get what I want that I’m some sort of—of—lunatic?” This goddamn chair. Why doesn’t he understand that I can’t be myself when I’m uncomfortable? I’m not coming back here if he doesn’t change it.\n\n“No, of course not, Jack, it’s just—you’ve told me yourself, about the way you never understood your siblings, how they annoyed you when they cried or talked about their concerns, how everything you do inevitably becomes dull—you’ve changed fields three times in a decade, for Chrissake!” The doc’s getting nervous, I can see. Sweating too much, and he keeps clicking that huge pen of his. I hate it. \n\n“So, I get bored, big #BADWORDS# deal, everyone does it.” I smile again—it’s pained this time though, just like my back. He sweats some more. “I’ve never—Jesus! What kinda nerve do you have, calling me a—“\n\n“Jack, please. You asked for my professional opinion. Everyone harbors some degree of psychopathy. Your case is just particularly pronounced. It doesn’t mean that you’ll hurt or kill anyone, it just means the inhibitions present in others are not there for you.” He keeps clicking that pen, back and forth, back and—\n\n“Could you stop that? I’m trying to think here.” Thing’s almost as bad as the chair. \n\nIt stops. “My apologies.” He’s still sweating, flicking his eyes from me to the pen.\n\n“Thank you.” I make a grimace that I hope passes for forgiving.  “I guess this explains why I killed that kid who took my tricycle in the third grade, huh?”\n\nHe starts. “I’m sorry, wha—“\n\n“Oh, come on, Doc, give me a #BADWORDS# break.” I laugh a bit, but he doesn’t seem convinced. “Of course I didn’t kill someone over a tricycle.” \n\nHis mouth curls up hesitantly. “Of—of course. That kind of pathological lying, though, is also indicative—“\n\n“Oh, come off of it!” I stand up and pace around the spacious office, glancing at him as he shrinks back into his chair. “You think because I hit my sisters a few times when I was a kid and never said sorry for it and lied to my parents when they asked me about it and lied to my friends when they asked me what my dad did and lied to my girlfriend when she wanted to visit my folks but I said they were dead that I’m a—“ #BADWORDS#. \n\n“—I think our time’s up, Jack.” His voice squeaks out as he clasps his pen, clicking the point out one more time slowly. “I think a different the#BADWORDS# would serve you better.”\n\nI nod slowly, breathing deep. The pacing’s brought some sweat out—I’ll have to change this shirt—but it’s better than sitting in that chair. “Of course, doc. Send me some recommendations. Thank you for the… diagnosis. It’s very enlightening.” \n\nHe nods, loosening his grip on the pen. “No problem, good luck.”\n\n“Thanks.” I stride towards the door, pausing for a second. “One more thing—about that kid?”\n\nHe stares at me, eyes blinking steadily. “Yes?”\n\n“It was a bicycle, doc. My favorite bicycle. Only bicycle, to be honest. And that #BADWORDS# took it from me. I didn’t kill him, course, just broke his arm. And his leg. Well, both his legs. Told the neighbors he fell off while riding. Which he did.”\n\nHe won’t stop looking at me, his face scrunched up like he’s about to either scream or pass out. “Jack—I really think you—“\n\nI shut the door behind me.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388974443","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceich8y","link_id":"t3_1uhaef","name":"t1_ceich8y","parent_id":"t3_1uhaef","retrieved_on":1435537072,"score":14,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":14}

I didn't know anything, but these primal urges kept coming, and they were telling me to kill.\n\nThey shoved a sword in my hand, strapped a plate of metal to my chest, and sent me to war. I wasn't fully conscious. They told me to run, so I ran. They told me to fight, so I fought. They didn't tell me to be angry, but I was angry anyway. I would be running, and feel some flash of pain from before, a vision from another time, and all I would want to do is fall and weep. But it would pass, and I would still be running, and I would be even more angry, and not know why.\n\nI killed a lot. It seemed as natural as breathing. Sometimes I would wonder why, but I would see the others killing and any thought of stopping would leave my mind. Sometimes I would have flashes, I would think of all those I killed, the men and women and children, but they went quickly and I just became more angry.\n\nOne day I was killing, and I came to realize that all the others were dead, and I was alone. The men we had been fighting were coming towards me, and for the first time in my life I felt fear. I wanted to be angry and to kill, but no others were around to show me how. So I ran.\n\nWhen I awoke I was truly alone. No men, no others like me, just a vast wilderness. I saw my blade, with the blood of so many years of killing, and I was ashamed. Suddenly I thought of all those I had killed, and there was no one no wake me from my thoughts, and I fell and wept. Again and again I wept, until I couldn't anymore.\n\nI threw away my blade, and the metal I was wearing. Now I only eat what's already dead, or the plants along the river, although at first they made me sick. Sometimes I have another flash, and I have to curl up and weep until I forget. I don't know what will happen to me, but I know I'll never kill again.\n\n---\n\n-005","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388986367","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceihox5","link_id":"t3_1uij2u","name":"t1_ceihox5","parent_id":"t3_1uij2u","retrieved_on":1435536892,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

His Waagh had just laid siege to an Imperial Forge World and by Gork and Mork that was the most fun he had ever had in all of his years of existence. \n\n\nA solid two years of nonstop fighting with those 'Ummies' and those 'Space Marines', he wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the Galaxy...well that wouldn't be exactly true, he'd definately trade it for a chance to fight in Ghazghkull's Waaagh on Armageddon, now that was a War Boss to end all War Bosses. \n\n\nBut alas, the Planet was most obliterated after a Warp Storm had suddenly occurred, tearing the Planet asunder with it's otherworldly wrath. Daemons and Chaos forces ran rampant on the Planet, killing Ork and Imperial alike, the Storm had occurred so suddenly that neither side was prepared for it despite being in the middle of fighting. Once the Storm cleared, Nazgrig awoken to find himself pinned under some rubble in a burnt out husk of what used to be some form of a refueling station.\n\n\nRubbing the kinks out of his neck and popping his dislocated arms back into place, the Greenskin found none of his kind to be in sight. The Warboss was missing, the Nobz, the Shoota Boyz, the Biker Boyz, the Rocket Rangerz, the Grechins, the Squigs, not even a simple Snotling could be found anywhere. Although he had survived the war, what good was an Ork without another Ork to share in the Orky victory? \n\n\nAlone and without a Waaagh or a means to leave the Planet, Nazgrig spiraled into a depression which seemed endless. There were no bodies of his kin so he couldn't simply wait for them to return, even a Snotling being welcome at that point if only to relieve the tension of having no Greenskin kin by his side. Alas, what little Ummie survivors there were in the Forge World were hunted down by the depressed Ork, knowing it to be pointless again without Orks to share in the slaughter with, he couldn't quell his own violent nature nonetheless. \n\n\nAnd so, Nazgrig the Mad Dok was forced to pillage and plunder an entire Imperial Forge World alone, his loneliness only becoming more apparent whenever signs of his former Waaagh could be found be it in the form of a discarded Shoota or the crumbling scrap heap that used to be a Killa' Khan. Truly, an Ork was never more pitiful then when he was alone.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1388991225","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceijcys","link_id":"t3_1uij2u","name":"t1_ceijcys","parent_id":"t3_1uij2u","retrieved_on":1431819951,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

He had climbed Mount Everest 74 times, and had successfully jumped off each time and lived to tell the tale.\n\nHe was also the most handsome hot guy who ever graced the ladies' eyes ever, and there was also no disputing that (in fact, there wasn't much to dispute about John Smith at all, because he was indisputably totally #BADWORDS# awesome). He had perfect face structure, flowing blonde locks (which he could immediately change into short hair, if that's your thing, babe), and muscles that bulged so much that they ripped his shirt open every time he put one on, so he just walked around bare-chested because he was starting to spend *way* too much money on shirts. His eyes were also a deep and beautiful blue (which he could change to green, by the way, if that's your thing, babe), a deep that was deeper than the Mariana Trench.\n\nJohn Smith was also very popular with the ladies. Everyone else was jealous of his ability to attract the hottest babes around. All he had to do was stare at a lady and they would swoon. (Thankfully, he was skilled in medical stuff too, so he could instantly revive them, after which they would thank him profusely and then they would enjoy a nice date together). He was so hot that he had 700,402 girlfriends, and he knew all of their names, birthdays, addresses, families, and favorite colors, because his memory was *that* good. He could also attract men, because he was so hot, but he wasn't into that.\n\nAnyway, John Smith, the most manliest manly man, who was also handsome and popular and skilled at practically everything you could ever think of ever, had just one problem: he had yet to find a lady as perfect as he was.

Thursday is just too, I don't know, before friday ish. It's unimportant. Wednesday, it's always been there for me. My worst day. You know she left me on a Wednesday, then died in that car trip away from our apartment on that same Wednesday. I lost my job exactly one week later. And every one since I've planned how I could do this. For example, here is the only building in the city tall enough to see all the way from our little apartment on the west side back to the suburbs she lived in as a child. And there, look there, we had our first walk by that river where I told her I was afraid of heights and she told me she hated spiders... and the middle of the week, because nothing ever happens then. And there well, there's where our son could have been born. Please don't ask what day she miscarried, I'm fairly certain you're seeing this trend. No, today and right here, I think I'll do it. It's just  that now that you're up here, I can't seem to do it without you first.\"\n\n\"Damn, you've kind of planned this all out, haven't you?\" Mary says now sitting.\n\n\"Yeah, of course, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Nah, not really. I mean, I have my reasons. You know that bully you had in class? The kind that would combat-boot crush all your toys, he'd put his licey cap on your head to watch you itch, and he'd make a point everyday to let you know how worthless you are. Well he lives inside my head. He wakes me up every morning pouring a cup of hot anxiety in my face to let me know this day will be just as horrible as every other one. Today I figured I'd hit him first. Plus this kind of things runs in my family. We haven't had a girl die from external forces since women were actually stoned for adultery. Old family habits die hard you know, and a girl should follow her mother's footsteps.\"\n\n\"You're taking this pretty lightly\" Tom tells her.\n\n\"Well, I figured it would help me fall a bit slower you know. Light like a feather.\" Mary says before Tom sends her a disapproving looking. \"I deal with things that way. I used to cry a lot, like my mom did. I used to make everything my tragedy, then I stopped. I stopped cutting, I stopped crying, and I stopped caring. It hurts less just to scab and scar but never bleed.

I also wanted to make the sunrise. I've never missed one, and needed to see it today, one last time. \"\n\nMary looked out past the horizon. She saw her old home, out past the river where she'd pretend to be the water spirit. In that sunrise, the water looked like golden. Those waves of gold covered up the little holes where fishes hid before coming out. It covered up the burial place of her dog which fell in before never coming out. She remember her mother telling her never to play to close or she'll fall, but she jumped in herself. She had nearly froze to death when her mother finally fished her out, gave her hot chocolate, and sent her back outside to do it all over again.\n\n\"So are we going to do this? I can race you. You know, I may look skinny, but I was a diver in college. I'll beat you by nearly 3 seconds.\"\n\n\"Nah, how about this. You and I get some real food, and we'll come back up here this evening. We'll both have a real last dinner to be proud of, and then we'll do it.\" Tom said, taking a step backwards\n\n\"Sounds good. I need more than deep fried chicken in my system to do something like this.

{"archived":true,"author":"GoAheadMakeMyPie","body":"(Prompt includes some references to J.R.R Tolkien's books and his fictional mythology.)\n\n\nWe've all seen Orcs in battle. Fearless lords of death and steel marching with anger and courage which silenced many of our allies, march united with hungry eyes that wish nothing upon you but death which will never satisfy their desire to kill and conquer. An Orc is a foe which is to be respected in the battle but annihilated with no indifference mercy to young or old. They bring nothing upon this world but barbarism, violence and unsettlement to other races dwelling on this land. \n\nOrcs are mindless we say. Orcs are barbarians. Are they all? They don't wield in arts of magic. Nor do they study and practice the cultured history and origins of Middle Earth, or our creator. Doesn't it seem weird that every other race has rich and beautiful culture which is with pleasure and awe gazed upon, but Orcs's entire history could be reduced to mud and tears? I you think such matter is peculiar, you are on the right track. \n\nYou see. I was quite an adventurer myself in my days of ripe youth. I used to travel and slay many of Sauron's minions. I also was the one of not many to survive an orkish night raid. Just like poor Frodo, I was unconsciously taken by force to their land, where I was to serve as a slave till blood flows from my eyes and feet fall off from filthy root. Oh yes I seen their distasteful and repugnant ways. I know first hand that on the battlefield, those foes deserve no mercy. Their homeland is indeed just as pleasant as their breath and teeth. You see, I was the only one form  my kin to be taken alive. Although my experience was dreadful, what my eyes have seen than made me wiser than any book and any lecture.\n\nOrcs are born into full adult-like bodies. Born form mud of the Valar, they arise to live a life which is worth living. For most unfortunately, influenced by merciless culture and longing form glorious battles, they strive to become an ''true'' Orc. A warrior. As you can imagine just like us humans, some are born wiser and some are not. Orcs aren't that different. Yes by nature their appearance is aggressive and of Melkor's nature, but some indeed see beyond the mantra of endless violence. Those which question, whose which think, those poor which dare to ask ''Why?'' end up either as a dinner meal, or even worse. They are sacrificed to Melkor by being burned alive and dipped in hot oil. Screams of Orkish sacrifice serve as music and inspiration to Melkor to anguish his pleasure of death and destruction of what is noble and beautiful.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389059691","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cej6t3o","link_id":"t3_1uij2u","name":"t1_cej6t3o","parent_id":"t3_1uij2u","retrieved_on":1431831220,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}
{"archived":true,"author":"modog11","body":"Long before the war had ever truly started, both sides had begun their preparations. Vast armouries stored away in the hearts of suns and megaplanets, numberless fleets of planet killing starships drifting silently in the cold hard space between galaxies, and legions of carefully bred and built warriors were prepared in secret. Fortification systems larger than a galactic spiral arm were constructed in the aeons-long build up, whilst minefields capable of laying waste to a galactic cluster in a single moment if triggered were laid around the borders and flash points of the brewing and inevitable war. In planet sized laboratories weapons of all kinds were built and held in reserve against the dreaded day when defeat might raise it's head. Biological weapons like viruses, plagues and tailor-made predatory monsters were pitted against matter-eating concoctions brewed up by sick alchemists and the reality-warping devices of the quantum mechanicians. Whole galaxies were seeded with peaceful races or natural wonders to blunt the will to destroy on both sides, but often forming vast traps waiting to be sprung when the enemy had been calmed and pacified.\n\nWhen it eventually came the war was fought on a truly universal scale. A single skirmish may see the rise and fall of a dozen interstellar civilisations, each unwittingly pressed into service as weapons or warriors, or exploited for resources or ideas to further the war effort in some small way. The greatest battles were destructive beyond measure - planets themselves became bullets in time, their doomed inhabitants often unaware of the great war being fought around them. Such was the scale of the conflict that the many truces, armistices, ceasefires and peace accords that were reached were invariably broken and rewritten a thousand times before even half the combatants knew that they had occurred.\n\nBut one side was winning. Slowly, achingly, they were winning. It had long been forgotten who was fighting for who and what for of course, but nevertheless it seemed something of a victory might be possible in the next few mega-epochs.\n\nBut in a quiet and relatively unscathed corner of the universe, one of the last-minute experimental weapons was finally beginning to show results. None amongst the few enlightened beings still aware of the universal war's true nature could remember which side had created them, but finally humanity had occupied all of it's home galaxy and, convinced of it's loneliness in all of existence, was reaching it's sad and self-destructive pinnacle.\n\nUtterly assured of their omnipotence and mastery of the universe, humanity slowly let go of it's ideas of a greater purpose, and began to rot and collapse. Desperate to find a way out of their meaningless lives, the great and the powerful slowly gathered in the heart of the human hegemony, and planned for the final, ultimate end for not only their own kind but the apparently empty vastness of space. Dispossessed of the possibility of fulfilling their racial need for meaning, humanity began to put in motion the long awaited Big Crunch, in the hope that some meaning could be found by some other version of humanity in the next universe.\n\nThe ultimate doomsday device was ready.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389060205","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cej71x3","link_id":"t3_1ukefq","name":"t1_cej71x3","parent_id":"t3_1ukefq","retrieved_on":1431831339,"score":11,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":11}

{"archived":true,"author":"Space-Hamster-Deluxe","body":"The apartment building's stairwell smelled terrible, almost as if the access doors hadn't opened in a decade. How that was possible with an elevator that had been broken for at least as long I didn't pause to reflect on. I hurried my way downstairs instead. There was no way I was going to risk being spotted by nosey neighbours, or worse, caught by the cops. \n\nThe execution had been too messy for my standards. I had made two big mistakes. The first was forgetting to double check if the kid had left for school. She hadn't. The second one I made the night before, when I went a little too far in my exercise routine. There's always the risk that an execution is preceded by a struggle, a fight, or worse, a chase. You need to be in top shape. Strained muscles are a bad asset then. \n\nAs I left the stairwell and casually crossed the lobby, there was no sign of any commotion yet. That meant that the girl hadn't found an adult yet. I smothered a sigh of relief, went through the door and blended in with the crowd on the street. I entered the first subway station, bought a ticket and boarded the first ride towards my place. I sat down in a stained bench between two commuters in suits. Overhead the lights were flickering.\n\nI had finally gotten the bas#BADWORDS#. The man who triggered my gift roughly a decade ago, when we were both living two cities away, down the coast. He stood next to me, while we were waiting in line for a big concert. When I first looked at his face, I felt a #BADWORDS#ue recognition, like we had met before. But when I looked again, I saw another face, and suddenly a wave of memories came washing over me. Scattered fragments of a whole life coalesced into the sudden realization that, somewhere in asian history, I had lived a life, loved a woman, lost a son and died of a stab wound. My dying moments were spent watching that madman, who somehow was the same man standing next to me, ordering his soldiers to pillage, burn and #BADWORDS# my village in the name of some rebellion that was tearing the lands apart. \n\nThe experience ended with me throwing up on the backseat of a driving car. My friends later told me I'd gone pale and fainted, so they put me in a cab and paid my fare. That way they could still watch the concert. We lost contact after that. I was miffed to say the least about the cab thing, but the real, more pressing reason was that I kept having similar visions around certain people. The woman serving my coffee during lunch used to be someone I worked with in a Russian labor camp. The old man living across my street used to be a kid I ran into with my camel somewhere in North Africa. My supervisor at work had helped me steal food for my siblings from a temple in a tropical jungle. \n\nThe visions increased, up to the point where I'd have a dozen of them on a daily basis. Suddenly, friends and acquintances could become bitter enemies, or people I disliked staunch defenders of my cause. Even total strangers would turn into lovers, friends or sworn enemies. Hundreds of thousands years of human history went through my mind in a few months time. Ultimately, I quit my job and moved away from the city, away from the masses of people who reminded me of imaginary lives. \n\nFor over two years, I thought I'd gone completely bonkers, until I connected seemingly random dots between two footnotes in a history book, and a picture I saw in a small historical museum in the middle of the countryside. I didn't sleep for three days after I realized those experiences had been real. For some reason, however strange or fantastic, whenever I met a person who made an impression on me in a previous life, I would instantly recall that life, both happiness and hardship. I wasn't crazy after all, but I knew that if I told someone about it, they would call me just that. And many times I wished for the realization that it truly was madness.\n\nBut that only happened on bad days. Days where my courage dwindled, or the burden of my gift proved too much for my mind to bear. On most other days, I burned with conviction. Shortly after my visit to the museum, I got into a fist fight with a drunk at a truck stop. He got mad for staring into his face, but I saw the face of a nun who drowned babies that were conceived out of wedlock. I knocked him over, and he broke his neck. It was considered to be an act of self-defense, and I was acquitted of charges. Now, I had never been a man of God, but after that I stumbled upon shores of faith. Wickedness couldn't hide from my eyes, and I felt I owed the world the effort of cleaning it up. To punish those who had done wrong, and attempt to right the suffering that dripped out of every page of every history book. \n\nAnd so, I hit the road. Doing small jobs left and right, earning my keep and constantly moving. And when I met someone, man, woman or child, whom I'd met in an earlier life, I'd let my memories speak. Were they good people, I repaid them in kind. Had they done acts of evil, I provided punishment. It could be in the form of a simple prank, a knife to the throat and whispers in the dark, and in some cases, death. \n\nBut no matter where I went, who I met and what deeds I punished, the most intense vision had always been my first. The desire to pay that man back burned brightest of all. The passing years only stoked the fires of vengeance. And that was why I eventually returned to the city, despite the overwhelming amount of visions I received there. Several months I spent on the East Coast, going from one major population center to another, my search remaining fruitless, until we bumped into each other next to the stand of an asian grocery vendor. It was an uneasy moment, and it almost felt like he recognized me as well. He mumbled an apology, and continued ahead. I turned around and followed him. \n\nThe rest was almost too easy. I found out where he lived, where his kid went to school, where his wife was buried, what two jobs he did, and all the other information that allowed me to make the perfect silent kill. All that and my preparations took under a week. The deed itself hadn't gone exactly as planned, but he was dead, which is what mattered. All that was left for me to do, was wait until the adrenalin subsided and let the relief take over. With that thought in mind, and while stretching my strained muscles, I got up out of the subway seat. My stop was coming up. I got off, climbed the stairs and entered the neighbourhood where I was staying. It was a seedy part of town, but the rent was cheap and people minded their own business. \n\nMy head was still too occupied and the sun shining too bright to notice the kid sneaking up on me. He was still young, but big and strong. He pushed me up against the wall, my face slamming into the bricks. He wanted my money, wasn't making any jokes, was going to kill me, had iced people before. He added weight to his words by holding a pocket knife to my throat. My instincts kicked into gear, and I resisted my robber. This was the second struggle with another full grown man my strained muscles had to endure that day. But this one proved too much. I tried grabbing his arm and twisting it, but he was strong enough to resist and kicked the back of my knee. I only barely avoided falling over, but not without relinquishing control of the hand holding the knife. That's when he stabbed me. \n\nThe blade had entered my chest in a deadly spot, where I could feel my heartbeat throbbing against the edge of the blade. I looked up to the face of my assailant, expecting to see a murderous youth from society's cesspool, but all I saw was a mixture of fear and surprise, and the face of my son. The same son I lost to famine so many years ago, that had died in my arms because he secretly fed his rations to his little sister after the soldiers had stolen our food right before winter. \n\nWith trembling hands he pulled back the knife and ran off in sheer panic. I stood there, alone, leaning against the wall with my hands trying to stop the bleeding from a mortal wound. If there had been any witnesses, they'd already ran off. I sank to the floor, overwhelmed by sadness. Not because of my impending death, but because in that moment I realized the past eight years of my life had been a gruesome mistake. And in my dying moments, I wished my next life on this planet would be denied to me, or at least make me pay for what I had done in this one.

{"archived":true,"author":"Eryx897","body":"Latvia had little opportunity for a private art dealer, as this old man was. And oh how the locals annoyed him! They just accepted his prices. Nothing was talked about, sales was such a private business here! No social interaction. And if they thought the price was only a few dollars too high, they would only leave.\n\nOne night, he developed a plot. He would simply make his prices higher. That would make people ask why his prices changed, wouldn't it? If they could get the old price, for being an old customer? Yes, he thought, logical enough. So he did, pushed his prices up $10 dollars a piece. He sold art from around $10 to $50, so the prices on some of his pieces doubled. People still only accepted it or walked away. He grew angrier at this point, but finally, on the end of day seven of this trial price-raising period, an olive-skinned man approached his stand. He looked down at a small glass mosaic, a well-done piece depicting a dog in the middle of a street. Price tag, $40. He looked up to the seller and answered his prayers.\n\n\"How about $30?\" The old man sat down.\n\n\"What did you say, young man?\" He folded his hands, tears almost coming to his eyes at the words. The middle-aged man looked apologetic, he felt as if he had offended his elder.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's just that I've only $35 right now, and I'd love to have this piece before someone else comes along to buy it.\" The Arabic man looked down nervously.\n\nThe old man simply nodded. \"Yes, yes $30 would be just fine.\"\n\nSeeing an opportunity, the man joked. \"How about $25?\"\n\nThe old man laughed. \"I'm old, not a fool!\" And the young man joined him, paying his dues and taking the piece. He left with a smile, nearly the same smile he gave the old man.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389132358","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cejwc8j","link_id":"t3_1unix8","name":"t1_cejwc8j","parent_id":"t3_1unix8","retrieved_on":1431843452,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}

Ten seconds later, a figure in a long coat and sneakers passes through the same door.*\n\n\"I suppose you think this is funny?\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\"\n\n*Sneakers lingers at the gift shop, looking through magazines as Suit goes to the front desk.*\n\n\"The same cycle, over and over. Since Cain and Abel.\"\n\n\"Good work with that, by the way. Very compelling narrative. Did you ever give them a good reason?\"\n\n\"Giving them reasons denies faith. It all worked out for those two in the end, anyway.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how many have you lost because they couldn't fathom your motives?\"\n\n\"True faith doesn't waver from lack of evidence.\"\n\n*Suit enters the elevator.

I just meant it looks to be a good show.\"\n\n\"I thought you would be more interested in the outcome, all things considered.\"\n\n\"Me? I've got plenty of souls coming my way. I can afford to be patient.\"\n\n*Sneakers bursts through the door, breathing heavily. He catches a glimpse of Suit turning a corner, towards the parking garage. Patting his coat pocket, he sets off in pursuit.*\n\n\"This one at a time business is getting old.\"\n\n\"I've been trying to lead them away from their old mistakes. I can't entirely burn violence out of them, but I can keep them from completely destroying themselves.\"\n\n\"I just think you're lazy.\"\n\n\"Omnipotent, remember?\"\n\n\"Sure, but just because you have the power doesn't mean you have to use it, right?\"\n\n*Suit tries frantically to start the car. He sees Sneakers emerge from the far end of the lot and pull out a gun. He ducks just in time to avoid the first bullet.*\n\n\"Ooh, close one. Seriously, though, you've never given me a straight answer as to why you allow this at all. Not that I mind, but it's a bit puzzling.\"\n\n\"What is faith without trial?\"\n\n\"I think there's something more than that. I think you enjoy it. Like that last big war. You could have just had a bunch of people die and be done with it. But you had to have the drama, the ebb and flow, the big climax.\"\n\n\"I don't kill simply to kill. Every bit of that time served a purpose, or will serve one someday.\"\n\n\"Someday?\"\n\n\"I've got the entire span of the universe, and only so many lessons I can give.\"\n\n*The engine finally catches, and the car screeches forward. Sneakers fires again and again into the driver's seat. Too late he realizes that the car is headed right for him. He reaches for his rosary. The last thing he sees is Suit's body, crumpled and bleeding.*\n\n\"Huh. Didn't see that coming. So what lesson did that teach the teeming masses?\"\n\n\"That lesson wasn't for them. It was for you.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"See them?\"\n\n\"They're...both coming up here? What...?\"\n\n\"Violence is terrible.

It was such a heavy storm that the moment I walked out, my hair became stuck to my face and my leggings were soaked through. I loved that. I loved the feeling that I was vulnerable to nature, that nature could do what it liked with me. At the same time, I felt safe, as if I felt that nature would never allow me to die, for it would take pity on its creations. I breathed in the sharp clear air, surprising my throat. Then I ran. I ran past the lampposts, I ran past the abandoned umbrellas, I ran past the shops. I ran, continuing to gasp in the pure icy cold of the air, attempting to preserve it. I laughed as I ran, as rain bombarded my face until it was almost painful, and the thunder and lightning continued their delightful orchestra. I never could understand why some people hated storms. For me, storms were clarity. They were freedom. They were beautiful.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389200368","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cekiody","link_id":"t3_1upc8k","name":"t1_cekiody","parent_id":"t3_1upc8k","retrieved_on":1431854360,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"MattNextus","author_flair_text":"http://nextuswriting.tumblr.com","body":"I enjoy waking up from a good night's sleep. That in-between time where I'm not quite awake but not quite asleep either is my favorite. Sometimes I fall back asleep just enough to start dreaming, and sometimes I drift into awareness. The best part of waking up, though, is that my wife is almost always beside me, snoring lightly.\n\nThis morning, though, something was wrong. I didn't drift awake as I usually did, instead I was woken up by a bloodcurdling scream. I'd never heard my wife scream like that, but I knew it was her voice. I quickly looked around, trying to find the source of her fear. My eyes adjusted to the dim lighting and I saw her staring at me, frightened out of her wits. She had a sheet pulled over her body and was backing away from me. Something was terribly wrong.\n\n\"Who are you? Where am I? Why am I here?\" She asked quickly, out of breath from her screaming and scrambling.\n\nIt was like she had stabbed me right in my chest. Who am I? She didn't remember? She had been awfully forgetful lately, but to forget me... I didn't know what to do.\n\n\"Claire, it's me. Theresa. Your wife?\" I said, unsure.\n\n\"My wife? I'm 17 years old, I can't be married! Why aren't I at home?\"\n\nHolding back tears, I drew a deep breath. I tried to keep my voice as steady as possible. \"Claire, you're 36. We got married 12 years ago. You don't live at home anymore, you live here, with me and with our daughter. Do you remember Aeru?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said adamantly. \"I'm 17, you're lying! Take me home right now!\"\n\nBy the time she was dressed and downstairs, she had remembered. Luckily, Aeru hadn't had to see what happened. But I was scared.\n\nSomething was terribly, terribly wrong with Claire, and I don't know if I can fix it. I only hope that I can make it through this with her.

{"archived":true,"author":"LovableCoward","body":"He may have been silent drawing his blade, but he was no craven coward. With a shout he entered the field from the forest, caracoling with his mount, yelling out a challenge. We all looked up from the string of mounts we were tending. A hussar. With his massive amount of braid and his fur trimmed pelisse and busby, he cuts a fine figure on his bay horse. We smirk at one another. Hussars are dandies and popinjays to a man regardless of nationality. They consider themselves the greatest swordsmen and hor#BADWORDS# in any army. Perhaps. They are favorites of the women, what with their sharp uniforms and their dashing lifestyle. They drink champagne straight from the bottle, smoke constantly and chase women incessantly. They are the best dressed thieves and scoundrels the world over. They are in a word, vainglorious.\n\nOne of my lieutenants starts to climb into his saddle. I stop him. What better way to improve the morale of my men than to see their commanding officer fight and win in single combat. I grab my shako from the field table it was laying on and buckle it to my chin. I look down at my uniform to make sure I'm presentable. My dark black outfit with green facings is certainly more subdued than the hussar's getup, doesn't matter. I do not know what regiment he is from, they certainly know mine. The 1st Royal Lancers is the continent's premier cavalry unit, the chosen bodyguards of the King himself. There are no better wielders of the lance anywhere.\n\nI start riding to the middle of the field. One of my troopers tosses me a lance. I catch it without looking. As I ride to meet the hussar, his eyes flare as he catches sight of his opponent. He cannot withdraw now, not without humiliating himself in front of his fellows. Still, if he slays me, his leader would promote him to Colonel on the spot. We get within twenty feet of one another. We nod and acknowledge the other. I break the silence first. \"You know who I am, I am afraid I do not who you are.\" His horse sidesteps ever so slightly. \" I am Captain Francoise Gagnon of His Imperial Majesty's 3rd Hussars. It is an honor sir.\" \"So it is. Shall we begin?\" He smiles and nods cordially. \"Absolutely. At once!\" \"Very well. Good luck.\"\n\nWe move away from each other, counting out the distance, making sure there's no rabbit warrens that could catch a hoof. Once we're three hundred yards apart, we turn. He waves his sabre, I raise my lance in salute. We start off a canter, never wavering from one another. After a hundred yards, I break off in a gallop. He follows likewise. The horses are flying towards each other, clods of earth being thrown in the wake. With my lance, I have reach and the first strike. I aim towards his torso. Right before I run him through, he throws his body over the left side of his horse, hanging off the saddle with just a hand. My lance hits empty air. Both sides cheer at this marvelous display of horsemanship. We turn, and commence another attack. This time my lance punches into his left shoulder, throwing him back in the saddle. Before I can twist it deeper into him he hacks at it with his sabre, leaving the lance head and six inches of ash wood sticking in his shoulder. I toss my broken weapon aside and draw my blade. We circle, trying to find an opportunity to strike. He is bleeding, he needs to defeat me before blood loss weakens him. He charges. I block the overhead strike, and duck a wild horizontal slash. He could have decapitated me if it connected. I stab at his face, and he desperately knocks it aside. I then make a feint at his thigh with a quick stab, he swings his blade to block it. That leaves his head and right shoulder exposed. With a flick of wrist, I turn my stab into a high cut, chopping clean into his neck where it meets the torso. It sinks in two inches. He drops his sword and throws his hand on the wound, blood seeps between his fingers. It is a lethal injury.\n\nHis eyes meet mine. I nod my head in respect. His face, though pale, does not show fear. I grab the reins of his horse to steady it. I am inches from his face. His pupils are massive as endorphins flow through his system. I am the last thing he sees. A normal sort dressed in blacks and greens. \"When you meet Death, tell him Colonel Schneider sent you.\"                ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389215578","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cekpuz1","link_id":"t3_1uqh12","name":"t1_cekpuz1","parent_id":"t3_1uqh12","retrieved_on":1431857868,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

I had a concert tomorrow, in front of an audience of thousands. Beethoven, Bach, Chopin. Old standards, yet everyone's favorite.\n\n\"HELP! PLEASE!\" The woman sounded like she was being mugged, or maybe worse.\n\nI couldn't just stand there and do nothing. I had to act, to do something. I went to form a fist, held it up, determined to protect this poor woman. And slowly, almost as if by their own choice, my fingers uncurled, my hand fell back to my side. I couldn't risk my hands, my livelihood. If I went to save that young woman, I might break my hands. I might never play again. And I couldn't sacrifice my music for a stranger.\n\n\"SOMEONE! ANYONE! Oh god, no! Please!\" I closed my coat tighter against the chill of the night. \"PLEASE!\"\n\n\"Shut up, #BADWORDS#!\" This time it was a gruff male voice. \"You #BADWORDS# shut up. You like this.

{"archived":true,"author":"PainterlyWitch","body":"It was the best sort of night.  The receipt from the liquor store stated it was the twentieth of March.  First day of spring, and what a beautiful beginning.  Not too cold yet not hot enough for the bugs to start botherin' you in the night.  I sat down on a park bench by a patch of trees to shade me from the sun come morning and began my decent into drunken sleep.  Again.\n\nAt least I would have, if a black blur of long iron-scented fur hadn't have knocked my drink to the cracking, grass-patched pavement and wasted last week's begging money.\n\n\"Scat you sonuva-\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry mister, I swear I didn't mean to! I'm so sorry!\" The black blur sobbed.  What I thought was fur turned to hair when a cloud finally passed from in front of the moon.  Standing before me was a girl that couldn't have been but 16.   She was barefoot, and wearing nothing but a thin nightgown.  A thin nightgown soaked through with blood.\n\n\"#BADWORDS# Christ lady, where's the cut?!\"  I grabbed her hand but that only made her wail harder and kick out at me.  She lost her balance and fell to the ground, and in panic scurried up against a tree.\n\n\"Please don't hurt me please, I'm so sorr- Oh!\"  I traced the path of her eyes with mine.  She'd noticed, even in her distress, she'd noticed the scars.  They're nothing near as bad as they look, just the burns from upturning a pan of hot oil on my face when I was little.  My mother was planning on making french fries, and I just wanted to help.  She learned a good lesson from that though.  Don't keep a pan handle facing out with kids in the house.\n\n\"All right, I know I'm a looker but don't stare now.  You don't seem hurt so whose blood is this?  Are you alright?\n\n\"M-my dad's,\" She finally stammered.  Her gaze was firmly on the ground.  \"He tried to- I hurt him!\"  More sobs.  I held out a hand and offered a place on the bench.  Then we got to talking.\n\nI managed to get out that her mother wasn't in the picture.  Quite a shame for a young lady, certainly.  Her father was a nasty character, gone bitter over his wife's flight, and had been taking it out on her.  Everything out on her.  Obviously without his wife in the picture he was feeling lonely, and with a pretty daughter the spitting image of his wife. . . well.  You get the picture.\n\nI patted her on the back as we talked and she slowly began to unwind once she realized I was genuinely wanting to listen and help her out.  Apparently this time she wasn't going to let daddy's antics fly and took it upon herself to defend her body.  Power to her.  She'd started with the no's, then came locking herself in her room.  I was surprised she didn't call the cops at this point, but we do some crazy stuff in a panic.  Like smash whiskey on the ground.  He managed to break down the door and she was ready with a knife.  Daddy didn't back down, and now he can't really stand up.\n\nI listened to all this and my heart really broke for the little girl.  Obviously the best thing for her was to get out of the cold and into some professional hands. \n\n\"Lets go down to the police station and-\"\n\n\"No!  Didn't you hear me!  I killed him- I killed my #BADWORDS# dad!  He's dead now and it's on me and if they find out and if they find me. . . No!\"  She wrenched away from my consoling pats and glared the sharpest daggers at me.  Almost literally.  It was at this moment that I saw the knife in her hand.  #BADWORDS#.\n\n\"They're not going to do anything to you, I promise.  You acted in self-defense, didn't you?  You're alright, they'll help-\"\n\n\"They didn't help my mom, why do you think she ran away!\" The girl hissed.  \n\n\"I promise, I'll be there to help you through it, it'll be alright I swear.  Just come on, we'll get you cleaned up, and all of this sorted out.  Just put the knife down.  It'll be alright.\"  I slowly stood up, extending my arms in the most cautious and passive way that I could.  She didn't bite that bait.\n\n\"Of course I'll put down the #BADWORDS# knife!\"  No, I think she bit me.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389246736","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cel3tgm","link_id":"t3_1uqlr1","name":"t1_cel3tgm","parent_id":"t3_1uqlr1","retrieved_on":1431864648,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Demrec","body":"I sat there on the park bench. The jail was three states over, I was truly a free man again. I threw my hands up in the air triumphantly and laughed to myself. Free. What a glorious feeling it was. I dug into my bag and pulled out the half drunken bottle of whiskey I took from the truck I hijacked. Sweet lord, I missed this. I tilted my head back and looked at the stars. I took another swig and wiped my mouth of the excess that escaped me. I closed my eyes in sheer pleasure with myself and just let myself relax as I hummed to myself. I felt the wind kick up the hot summer air and listened the crickets, frogs, and birds. This is great.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes I saw that the stars were now blocked by the clouds that had come rolling in. Crap, it might rain. I need to find a place to keep dry. I stood up and took another swig. After a bit of walking I found a tunnel, it felt just a little colder here but I'd rather be a little cold than soaked. I couldn't hear any of the animals any more either just the clopping of my boots echoing. Whatever. Plenty of time to enjoy that crap later. I still had my booze to enjoy. The tunnel started to feel colder so I again, took another swig.\n\nI saw a small shadow moving in the distance. The fog from my breath hazed my view at first. I got closer, slowly, to inspect what this little thing was. As I got closer I could make out the shimmer of blonde hair. Then I saw her, a little girl no older than 10 sitting there in rags holding a beat up stuffed dinosaur.\n\nWhat luck.\n\n\"Hey there sweetheart, are you all alone in this tunnel?\"\n\n\"Uh huh. My dad and I had an arguement and he kicked me out of my home. He out me in a bad place with bad people and I got away not too long ago.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" I said sweetly, \"How long ago? Do you have a mommy?\"\n\n\"As long as I can remember. I never had a mom, just my dad.\"\n\n\"Aw well are you cold? You gotta be cold, how bout you come snuggle up with me, I have a blanket and I can show you a fun game!\"\n\nShe looked at me for a bit meekly. \"Why do you have all those scars?\"\n\n\"Oh well, I just got out of a bad place full of bad people too. Where I came they didn't like me very much.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because of who I love. I love princesses like you and the bad men didn't like that. So they used to hurt me. But it's okay because now I'm not at that bad place anymore\"\n\n\"This is a bad place,\" she said sternly.\n\n\"Aw it's not so bad, plus we have each other. We can be warm together come on I'll show you.\" I inched closer.\n\n\"Im used to the cold.\"\n\nThis kid is working my nerve. But I need to make sure she won't scream, I ain't going back that easily. If she keeps this up I'm going to enjoy killing her probably more than I will raping her.\n\n\"That's a bad thing to think about,\" she stared at me. \n\n\"What did you just say?\"\n\n\"You're thinking about raping and killing me. I heard you.\"\n\n#BADWORDS#, did I say that or think it? Wait, I definitely didn't say anything. At least I don't think I did. Waits how does this kid even know what #BADWORDS# is?\n\n\"I think you misheard me sweetly, what I meant was...\" I began.\n\nShe stood up. \"Shut up, I'm already bored with this. Your kind always think they're so clever.\"\n\nI stared blankly at this child. A cold chill swept over me and carried down to my toes. She just stood there, staring at me. I had never felt so uneasy since my first day in jail. Her eyes seemed to go through me.\n\n\"Jonathan Myers,\" How did she know my name?! \"Your scarred skin reflects the very nature of your scarred soul. I have come for thee...\"\n\nWhat the #BADWORDS# is this kid on? Is this a setup? Are the cops about to jump me? Was this all just a sting?\n\nI hear cracking behind me. I look over my shoulder to see the concrete floor give way and sink into a swirling abyss.\n\n\"Now you will go where there is no escape, where everlasting torment awaits.\" Her eyes glew red. \"I will rip your very soul from your hideous body and drag it down into perdition.\" Her nails grew long and sharp. \"You have been judged!\"\n\nShe lunged at me as I threw my arms up in defense I could feel her ripping the flesh from my arms and chest. Something grabbed me by the ankle. I heard a snap. I looked down to see a shackle around my ankle leading towards the abyss. The chain snapped tight as I felt it pull me closer. I lost my balance and fell to the ground. I tried grabbing anything to stop myself. Chains flew out of the abyss and latched onto my arms and remaining ankle.\n\n\"You thought you were FREE?! YOU WILL NEVER BE FREE OF THE TERRIBLE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE! I will see to it that for all eternity your immortal soul will burn in the hellfires of Dis!\"\n\nThe chains pulled me into the air and twisted my limbs as they yanked me into the abyss. Screams were all I heard.\n\nI woke up, sweating. Where was I? The tunnel? How... A dream. It was all just a dream. Oh god. I guess whiskey will do that to you after being sober for so long. I collected myself for a bit and chuckled to myself. God I was a real baby, I couldn't believe a dream #BADWORDS# with me that bad. I stretched my legs and made my way out of the tunnel. I saw a convenience store across the street outside of the park. Time to get me some smokes. I headed towards it and waited at the light.\n\n\"I'm waiting.\" I heard a familiar voice behind me.\n\nI turned. There she was. The little girl.\n\n\"NOOOOOOO!!!\" I screamed.

{"archived":true,"author":"Perish_In_a_Fire","body":"Macx knew the first rule, \"Never walk like you have a purpose.\" It wasn't just the motion of your legs, the swinging of your arms and the weight of your pack. Its the moment you are moving forward with scarcely any thought of what your limbs are doing. It becomes one of those fancy movie camera tricks, with the added benefit of feeling the air on your face and the drips from the branches above.\n\nIt was this frame of mind that he needed to be in. Not buried in the bustle of life, the chaos of intersecting needs and wants from random strangers. Walking without feeling the ground. Breathing without forcing in air.\n\nMacx stopped by one of the larger trees. He had been walking for... well, it was hard to tell. He never brought anything to anchor him to the outside, just his senses and a walking stick and pack. The sun was lower, casting deep orange beams that were split and redistributed to fine photon-sized slits further in the distance. Nature's own physics experiment, except with hundreds of tree trunks and waving leaves.\n\nScience in the woods, that would be something.\n\nMacx imagined a large cyclotron, magnets ribbing each segment arcing out into the woods and beyond. The liquid nitrogen chilled cylinder suspended over a stream, propped by a crude rock bridge. Scientists wearing hiking boots and leaning on the gleaming chromed tube, worrying over the alignment of the beam inside, oblivious to the world around them.\n\nBut there was no science, other than the large feedback loops present in the forest, the bustling of leaves doing their quantum trick, teasing light into nutrients. It would be like someone conjuring gold out of thin air, Macx thought. Just a wave of the hand and \"presto!\". Macx hopped back as the imaginary pile of gold bars hit the leaves, scattering them in his mind.\n\nAnother direction then, this is all looking a bit familiar.\n\nMacx closed his eyes and turned slowly. Not a dizzy spin to a random vector, but more of a careful tuning to invisible lines of force. Some joked with him when he did this, but Macx knew it was part of the secret. Be open and receptive, he thought. You can't go somewhere new if you don't let yourself be guided by outside influence.\n\nYes, this is it.\n\nMacx strode forward, hiking stick picking out small divits in the loose soil, layered like peeling wallpaper in an abandoned house, with leaves and smaller bits of bark, splinters of wood. He knew that his wandering was doing an essential good, the pits from the stick turning into homes for insects, gathering rain water for those living on the forest floor. He imagined the circle of good insect friends gathering and chatting. \"Isn't it wonderful we have such a thing!\", while preening antennae and folding translucent wings.\n\nMacx shook his head, climbing over a fallen tree trunk. If only it was that easy.\n\nThe sun was lower now, making its final transit below the horizon. Everything seemed larger now, emphasized shadows arcing out in impossible geometry, low rolling fog cresting the far edges as the temperature dropped. Macx adjusted his rain hat, and sat down on a nearby stump.\n\nHere. This feels right.\n\nHe stopped and listened. Simply taking in the sound, the absence of sound and all of the other faint echoes through time. It was here, the locus. This was where it should be. Macx dropped his pack, rain pattering on the slick surface, rolling off in quicksilver drops. He felt the energy building. That prickly sense on the back of his neck, the fine hair on his forearms.\n\nIt shot through straight from his feet to the top of his skull, head pulled back, mouth open to the rain.\n\n\"We.... are.... here....\"\n\nThere was so much to learn.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389298027","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"celir77","link_id":"t3_1uszga","name":"t1_celir77","parent_id":"t3_1uszga","retrieved_on":1431871856,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"NeoMegaRyuMKII","body":"Claustrophobia. That is the first word that comes to my head when I awaken with a hiss all around me. I see very little as I open my eyes. How long have I been frozen? 100 years? 200? 1000? As I push the glass above me, it releases and I take my first breath in I do not know how long. Next to me is a set of white clothes. My size. I wear them as I look around. A broken window lets in the orange sky. It is not as I remember.\n\nAll around it looks like nothing has gone right. \"Why am I here?\" I wonder. There is a machine, resembling old data storage tools. I think it is called a \"computer.\" I learned of these, I think. I step forward towards the machine and hear a loud creak. Under my feet the floor begins to crumble. I step backwards just as cracks begin to appear. The small area surrounding the computer collapses. There is no way out. Except... the window... I find that in my previous home of until a few moments ago there is a sheet. Can I use it to climb down? As I secure it, I see it will suffice. I go out the window and can see what is left. Almost nothing. A small hut, more damaged than the building I had just left. A tower, its use I know not. A broken stone figure. The skies above me are indeed orange. I see no source of light but there clearly is something making it.\n\nI enter the small burnt hut, to perhaps find an answer. Indeed I find something as a step i take sinks my foot into the earth below me and hits something. A metallic box. I know not how it survived. But then again I know not how I survived. I open the box and find a few pages. I read.\n\n\"To the one who finds this:\n\nThe Earth has used all of its resources in 2078. In an effort to continue to function, humanity has agreed to end conflict with each other to search for more resources. It began well but with increasing populations, even in other worlds, we had to search farther. Eventually we got so far it would be hard to go back. With humans reproducing with beings on other worlds, that which defined human has began to fade. In the year 2491, an experimental program named Project Survive was established. Twenty thousand pure humans, half male and half female, from across the planet have been chosen to stay. They would stay in specialized cryogenic suspension that can withstand even the worst. \n\nAs the decades passed, it became clear many of the explorers were not coming back, at least not in our lifetime. More and more humans could not withstand simply waiting. By 2712 nearly all humans have disappeared. There were so few resources that most people died. None could enter the facilities where the subjects of Project Survive did stay.\n\nI write this as I die, watching the last vessel leave in search of...\" \n\nI turn the page\n\n\n--------\n\n\nFor the more serious ending: [a place to live. It seems no ship will ever return, and I know not why some humans had to stay. Was there any doubt that eventually they will be left behind? As the year 3117 closes, I accept my life is to end.](/spoiler)\n\n[I can give you no advice on how to survive, and I know not how I managed it. All I truly know is...\" the rest is burnt to a crisp...](/spoiler)\n\n[\"I still don't know who I am,\" I think to myself. I walk around, feeling an urge to consume. But I have nothing. I search the hut and find nothing. No signs of life, not a single thing I can use to prolong this blessing and curse called life. All I know is that I want to know who I am, why I was released, and why I stayed where I stayed. ](/spoiler)\n\n[As I walk some more I see a glimmer in the distance. I go towards it. It seems I am not getting any closer. Is it moving away from me? Or am I seeing things? I move slowly backwards and indeed that which I saw is moving towards me. FAST. I finally see it is a small dome. Is that all? I try to pick it up and hear a rattle. A voice says \"speak your name.\"](/spoiler)\n\n[My name... I know it not... I say \"I don't know my name. I was frozen for hundreds of years\"](/spoiler)\n\n[\"Name accepted: Zenfo Rundre.\"] (/spoiler)\n\n[\"I have a strange name...\" I think](/spoiler)\n\n[The voice continues. \"Information: Your cryogenic tube has been set to open in the year 3128. You were programmed to say 'I don't know my name. I was frozen for hundreds of years' when asked for your name. It was to ensure none would speak the line and find this information. You were frozen not because you would be among the last humans but because you were born with perfect genetics. An absolute supersoldier. In the year 2489 we received a great threat of the removal of Earth from existence would come in 3128. Many were told it was the end of the resources and that it would be necessary to travel. In reality, they fled. They knew this not. A signal has been sent and a vessel will soon arrive to take you to the field of battle where you will defend humanity.\"](/spoiler)\n\n[Indeed, as the voice said, a ship arrives. Individuals in a dark uniform wave towards me, beckoning me aboard. I climb and sit in a silver room. Many others in white are around me. I am given an orange capsule and instantly recall everything and know it was the truth. As the ship leaves what is left of the Earth, and I await to fulfill the duties for which I exist.](/spoiler)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nFor the more amusing/\"why would you do this to me?\" ending: \n\n[resources for the ingredients for the greatest beverage we have seen: coca cola. It can only be made by the hands of a human\"](/spoiler)\n\n[A ship lands and strange aliens appear. They give me a list, thankfully in a language I can read, and many items.

Just about 3.5 pounds in weight, reddish-brown in color, and semi-triangular in shape, it performs miracles in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity.

You could look right at it and not even notice it.\n\n100,000 pounds of pure gold. Recognition by the king. Dukedom. Fame. It is burning inside me. It is too much for me to resist.\n\nI had always been a failure. I lost every tournament and faced constant ridicule from my peers. They'd call me the Vulture. They used to throw half eaten food at me and tell me I would never be more than an ugly beggar. All because the accident left me disfigured. Through no fault of my own was I forever to be the object of burning hatred. Their families would laugh at my father's face and talk openly of his defective son. My own father had never shown any affection towards me. He's ashamed of me. He tells me I'm the son of the devil. I've had enough and this is my chance.\n\nBut I know there is no way anyone could ever bring a dragon into the castle alive, unless he wanted to come. No one ever had. No one ever will. Many have tried, none have ever come back.\n\nThat's when the idea came into my head.\n\nImpossible as it may seem, maybe I could befriend the dragon. Maybe not befriend a real-life dragon, but at least beguile him to somehow get revenge on everyone else.\n\nAfter a full night's sleep, I made the journey across the range and through the forest. It was there that I met a hermit.\n\nI asked him what he knew about dragons. After some time of teasing the answers from him, he told me, cryptically, how to find the dragon I'm searching for.\n\nI thanked the man and traveled down the river and up the mountain. The trek lasted three days. My feet ached and my legs burned with the dull pain of long miles behind. I hadn't even told my father I was leaving.\n\nWhen I finally made it to the mouth of the cave, I knew that I would only have one chance at making this work.\n\nAfter some time slowly making my way down into the chambers, the heat began to rise and somehow I knew I was now in his lair. \n\nThen the gleam of thousands, possibly millions of gold coins and jewels broke through the darkness, burning with a radiant glow. Never before could I have imagined that such an enormous amount of riches could exist in the entirety of the whole world.\n\n\"Hello?\" escaped my breath, shaking.\n\nNo answer.\n\nAfter a pause, \"Hello!\" I said again, with a bit more bravado.\n\n\"There's no need to shout.\" whispered a voice very near behind me. \"You must be a very courageous... what are you?... to come here.\"\n\nAfter a few moments of being shocked with fear, I mustered, \"I'm a man, just a man, a bit extra skin and hunched over. A humble man\"\n\n\"Ha, never have I seen a man like you. You resemble a vulture,\" he laughed. \"I wonder if you taste like a man, or like a chicken. You certainly smell enough like a man.\"\n\nHow could he have known my shame? No matter. I can persevere a few more words of jest if it means my hopes come alive. His purpose is to become the agent of my glorious retribution.\n\n\"Well, before you eat me, I bring you a message.\"\n\n\"Pray, do tell...\"\n\nI then started to pour out my heart and my plan to the vicious beast.\n\nMy plan is such to let him know that I know the dragon's weakness. Not any physical vulnerability, but a weakness in his mind; The monster had an eye for gold and riches of all kinds. I knew from the stories that he craves all glittery things. That his heart burns for precious stones and bullion from the farthest reaches of the world.\n\nI then related to significance of what I am here telling him now.\n\nI spoke of the townspeople, bored and complacent. The dragon hasn't been seen for many years. The reward was nonsensical and people don't notice the posting on the tree anymore. The children don't even believe that the dragon is real, let alone had ever lived on this earth.\n\nI explained that he must make his presence known again. He must show the world what fear is, what respect is. \n\nAnd for his troubles: 100,000 pounds of pure, shimmering gold. Why shouldn't he have all the riches the world has to offer? It's as good as his. All he has to do is take it.  \n\nHe is a willing pawn in my game. All he has to do is complete my revenge. My only prayer is that he lets me live long enough to watch them burn. To watch them all burn. To burn just as I had burned all those years ago.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389340425","downs":0,"edited":"1389340650","gilded":0,"id":"cem04xz","link_id":"t3_1uuszi","name":"t1_cem04xz","parent_id":"t3_1uuszi","retrieved_on":1431880283,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

I learned that much at least.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" A soft voice comes from behind me.\n\nI look back in my lawn chair. Lauren is standing by the sliding glass door. \n\n\"Yeah I'll be fine.\" I'm always fine, i'm not sure how I feel about Lauren. Mother used to say the same thing about dad. But she learned to love him when he showed up too.\n\n\"David, do you think you could cook us some dinner? I still don't know how these...stoves work.\"\n\nI laugh, \"yeah its a little more complicated then what you're used to. I'll show you how it all works.\"\n\nShe smiles. Its a nice smile...yeah...I suppose I could get used to her living here. I scoot past her, careful not to invade her personal space. Right into the entry way. I take a left at the end of the hall as I always do. \n\nKitchen to the right, bedroom to the left. Same as always. But that's not the same. That door. That door isn't the same at all. Its brown, and tall. With a single gold handle. A plain brown door with a gold handle.\n\nI reach out and touch the handle, its cold. With a turn and a pull it swings open. The cream walls give way to a white hallway. There are other brown doors here. Endless in all directions.\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear.\" A soft cooing voice comes from above. \"There must have been a slight glitch in the software, we'll fix that real quick.\" A white...being drops from the ceiling. More energy then substance it waves two gold gloves around in a panic.\n\n\"What...\" David murmurs.\n\n\"Shhh, don't worry.\" The warden says. It waves a hand over his head, \"There, that's better.\" David's eye's lose focus. \"Are you hungry?\" David nods. \"Here you go sweetie.\" \n\nThe warden pulls out a banana from the nothingness within its center. The gold hands peel it and pop one end in Davids mouth. David instinctively grabs the end as he takes a bite.\n\nThe warden strokes his head as it turns him around and pushes him back towards the door. \"There you go, you cute little thing.\" The door slams shut behind David. The warden looks to the camera in the upper corner. There was no malfunction, its all just part of the show.\n\nFrom the observation deck above the houses the tour guide leads the crowd in a round of applause. \"Lets hear it for our dedicated AI!\" The warden performs a curt bow before drifting back towards the ceiling. \"Now, lets see what happens next.\"\n\n\"Ms. Vrit!\" \n\n\"One second dear.\"\n\nI'm standing in the entryway. Foyer? Is it a foyer...where did I hear that word. \n\n\"Is that a banana?\" Lauren asks from the other side of the glass door. Her feet firmly planted on the soft grass of the backyard.\n\n\"...Yeah.\"\n\n\"I didn't know we had any...\"\n\n\"Do you want the rest?\" I walk over to her, the curious banana still in my hand. I step out into the backyard. For a moment I look over the fence. Endless blue, a shimmer here, there, occasionally I swear I can see it. But no, mother said that this always happened. Just like it happened to her father and all the way back. I hand the banana to Lauren and she takes a triumphant bite. Yeah, I could get used to her living here.\n\nThe observation deck erupts into cheers. \"Well, it looks like Lauren and David have a bright future together.\"\n\n\"Ms. Vrit! What happened to the rest of of them?\"\n\n\"Oh, they're all gone honey, they only survive in captivity now. That's why this is so important!\"\n\n\"...Oh.\" The boy says thoughtfully, sticking his lower arms securely into his pant pockets. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389355548","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cem2nvp","link_id":"t3_1uveng","name":"t1_cem2nvp","parent_id":"t3_1uveng","retrieved_on":1431881475,"score":19,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":19}

{"archived":true,"author":"_AcrossTheUniverse_","body":"Life. \n\nStrangely enough it reminds me of a bullet, bursting through in a brilliant flash and piercing through the air faster than you can comprehend. \n\nAs I stand in a puddle of pooling blood, feeling numb yet alert, I sense that something isn't quite right. My heart hammers in my chest, yet my brain feels like it can't quite process anything. My body feels immobile and I get a feeling akin to that a person gets when they experience a drop on the roller-coaster; the feeling of uncomfortable weightlessness in the pit of their stomach. \n\n\"Psst,\" I hear a voice say and my head snaps up to find a grinning brunette boy smiling at me, \"Hello.\" I look at him, and feel my eyes narrow. \"Go away!\" I exclaim, \"You're nothing but trouble!\" \n\nThe boy grins sardonically but speaks innocuously, \"You should have listen to me. You know I'm always right.\" \n\n\"Shut up! Shut up!\" I shout, \"I should have listened to them, the doctors. They said you were trouble! They told me you were wrong. You're not real, you don't exist. Go away!\"\n\nThe boy shakes his head and says, \"They're wrong; you know they're wrong. They didn't help you when Clara broke your heart. They didn't help you achieve greatness like I did.\" \n\n\"Greatness? You made me bloody kill someone!\"\n\nThe boy frowns, I can see the amu#BADWORDS#t dance in his eyes, \"Did I though? I just gave you an idea, I never gave you the gun. Neither did I pull the trigger, you're the one who did that.\" I shudder and look away. He seemed so ingenuous; he looked not a day older than ten. \n\n\"Please,\" I beg him, \"Leave me alone. Please.\" \n\nThe boy chuckles, \"Didn't I tell you? I can't. I never can or will. I'm bounded to you.\" \n\nI feel tears streaming down my face. The wicked glint in his eyes tears through the innocent countenance he posses. He smirks as he says, \"Nothing can silence me. Not even the bullet that killed you.\" He points to my chest and I look down at my sweater.\n\nMy once snow white sweater has now been tainted with a crimson tone that continues to grow. I gasp and look up at him, \"What did you do? Why did you do this to me?\"\n\n\"I never did. You did. You tried to silence me, you can never silence me. You can't silence the demon of your own mind now, can you?\" \n\nDarkness begins to crawl into my field of vision, and I feel dread and fear curl within me. I tried to fight the monster that possessed my mind with all I had. The roaring creature in my head had impenetrable thick skin that was difficult to pierce through even with my spear of will. I stabbed it over and over again, but not once was I rewarded with even the sound of it crying in pain. Instead, each time I delivered a blow to it, it lashed out on me. Clawing or snapping at my will as I did so. \n\nFinally I gave up. Finally I took my spear and pierced myself. I had enough. I had to do it. I had to make the choice, because sometimes when you can't silence the monster, you have to silence yourself. \n\nThe logic seems nonsensical, but if you were in my armour, you wouldn't question it.\n\nThe darkness has now almost completely taken over my vision, a small tunnel is all that remains of my sight. It focuses on the boy whose smile has turned rueful as he watches my demise drag closer. \n\nIt strange isn't it? The very thing that reminded me of life, seized my life. \n\n\"It's really a shame,\" the boy who I notice is fading as my life vanishes, says. \"You fought against me even when I helped you. Saved you from insanity.\" Right before the last wisp of him evaporates into thin air, and my life slips completely away I hear him say, \"And here I thought we could be friends.\" \n\n~\n\nSpare me from any harsh comments. This is my first post here. I hope it was good enough (though I'm not quite sure it's all that good). Thanks for reading! I hope it's alright.

{"archived":true,"author":"the_phenom_imam","body":"**A Landscape of Dreams**\n\nI’d read that dreams are actually completely non sequitur, and when you remember a narrative it is your brain’s attempt to make sense of the detached world it had been imagining in the context of the ongoing narrative of the real world. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So your dreams aren’t actually what you were dreaming linearly, but your mind scrambling to make sense of what the #BADWORDS# they just saw. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just *just* saw. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the light of the light.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So I may have been dreaming about art class with my niece. It was two weeks ago, when we actually took the art class at the library. And by taken I mean stolen. Those moments in that place in time were mine to now recall whenever I wanted.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We were smearing green and brown and a mixture of orange red and yellow never fully mixed together on a canvas where we’d already painted a shimmeringly dark blue lake. It was a blob. A huge blob with waves a quarter inch off the canvas, but that paint would dry. Would add texture. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But we’d painted her on her bicycle. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But her smile. Her smile was genuine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, I may have been dreaming about the last time I’d truly felt in love, yes#BADWORDS#ay, at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. It was sunset and the sky over Baja blazed orange and pink against the blue like a neon sign. And under the shade of tinted car windows the colors paled to a mesh of warm tones and that sparkling blue and we kissed and I said “I love you Maria,” and with all of my cynical bones I meant it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But my love’s name is Penelope.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But the love. In the tingling toes and closed eyes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, I may have been dreaming about the night of the accident. A decade ago, so vivid. The streetlamps an objective light on the mess left of the couple who’d swerved on the empty road a half minute ahead of me. The near motionless scene like an oil painting drying in a room lit by a ceiling fan. Small shush of rear wheels on the upended car. Orange turn signal still blinking. The blue cast of moon on the dark, dark pavement around the bodies, the orange dress. The deep red blood pooled. Splattered. 911.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I remembered thinking *911*, emergency. I remember thinking “*Wake up.*”\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, I may have been dreaming of nearly anything before I awoke. Same as anyone. And the dream stuck with me, mostly in the brilliant colors. The mishmash of orange and red and yellow in the fall’s palate of oak, aspen, maple on the smallest of scales. The shimmering blue lake. The landscape below me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The wind at my face seemed natural. I’d been rushing through time at a steady clip.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, I may have been dreaming about anything when the plane tore apart. And waking, my mind rushed through its files to make sense of the situation. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But by then, well…\n\n-----\nWith the #BADWORDS#le it ended up 500 words on the dot.

{"archived":true,"author":"finspake","body":"Jack Lennox smiled as the detective entered the interrogation room, his gray eyes lit up with amu#BADWORDS#t. \"How may I help you, Detective?\"\n\n\"The name's Smith. I've got a case for you, Lennox. Figured I'd pick your brain about it.\" The man settled into the chair opposite Lennox, pausing to light a cigarette. Lennox wrinkled his nose as the smoke wafted towards his face.\n\n\"Of course, you know I'm always happy to assist. And, uh, these things...?\" he said, gesturing at the cuffs around his wrists. \"Are they really necessary? You don't actually think I'm a suspect in this murder, do you?\"\n\nSmith leaned forward, his breath so strong Lennox couldn't help but move back a little. He looked young, Lennox thought, and acted it too--the physical posturing, the poor attempt at creating mystery, the kitschy interrogation room. Obviously not used to dealing with someone as well-versed in crime as Lennox. \"How do you know I want your help with a murder?\" Smith asked, his blue eyes boring into Lennox.\n\n\"With all due respect, Detective, it's rather obvious, isn't it? Your office has never consulted me on anything less, and the fact that you have dragged me in here so unceremoniously, despite my long--and I mean long--relationship with this department means that the situation must be grave.\" Lennox shifted forward again, daring Smith's toxic breath to say, with as much disinterest as possible, \"So, tell me about this... mystery. And then once I've solved it, take these cuffs off me so we can end this farce.\"\n\nSmith sighed, settling back in his chair. \"It's the strangest thing, you know? A man, found dead in his own bedroom, no windows, six-inch thick steel door, locked from the inside. We had to jackhammer through the cinderblocks to get through, and the only reason we found him in the first place was because the housekeeper said the place was starting to smell. Last time he'd been seen was a week ago, going into that room just like always.\"\n\nLennox smiled with satisfaction at the description, thinking back. It'd all gone so well, hadn't it? But Smith was looking at him strangely. \"I'm sorry--it's just, i do love a good puzzle, you know? I assume you haven't any suspects? Classic locked room, really, textbook.\" He looked at Smith expectantly... but the detective was smiling back at him.\n\n\"Well, no, not exactly. We do have one suspect, you see,\" said Smith, with a grin that seemed to stretch out his entire face.\n\nLennox summoned up his most condescending expression. \"The housekeeper, I presume?\"\n\nSmith's grin disappeared. \"Well, yes, at--\"\n\n\"Come on, man,\" Lennox said. \"You can't possibly think it was her, can you? I knew you were green, but... if that's your suspect, why drag me in here?\"\n\n\"At first, Mr. Lennox,\" Smith continued smoothly. \"But then we found something, inside the room.\"\n\n\"What's that, Detective? A venomous snake? An inscription scrawled by the murdered man in his own blood? A forged suicide note?\" Lennox couldn't keep the contempt out of his voice, really, this man was so simple-minded, it bored him so much to--\n\n\"No, Mr. Lennox. We found fingerprints. On the door handle on the locked side. Your fingerprints, to be exact. And after forensic analysis, it appears they match the strangle marks on the poor man's neck.\" Smith stared at Lennox, waiting for his reaction.\n\nLennox's mind had paused for a second, knocked out of sync by Smith's second sentence. *Fingerprints?* He forgot--\"I forgot *fingerprints*?\" He felt the blood rush to his cheeks, the shame already building. \"#BADWORDS# *fingerprints*?!\"\n\nSmith just looked at him. \"I'll take that as a confession, Mr. Lennox. I'll see you in court.\" He stubbed out his cigarette, still smoking after the exchange. It'd been less than five minutes. He left without a word, looking back once to see Lennox bent over the table, his head in his hands, eyes blinking rapidly, muttering to himself.\n\n\"Of all the things to miss--fingerprints. Goddamn fingerprints.\" Lennox started to cry.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389415591","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cemq7xt","link_id":"t3_1uxkis","name":"t1_cemq7xt","parent_id":"t3_1uxkis","retrieved_on":1431892847,"score":19,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":19}

Just a highschooler with a history of #BADWORDS# english teachers, so c&amp;c would be awesome! \n\n\nThe wind sprinted across the dry, wheat field and filled the den with an all too familiar scent. \n\n\"*Humans...*\" the resting dragon wistfully whispered. \"*In your best intentions, I hope you've brought more than ten knights this time...*\" The resting dragon soon rose from the rough rock it called its bed, and strode around to warm its dormant muscles. \n\nAt a staggering 30 feet, the dragon knew it was death incarnate for cowardly humanity. It knew if a human managed to come close enough to smell its rank breath, they would faint from fear. It knew its intense fire breath not only engulfed people in flame, but also in dread. It knew its jagged claws and teeth, along with its blood red scales provided a nightmare for them. It knew all these things, and yet still was an herbivore. \n\nThe deafening galloping from a hundred, sturdy horses echoed throughout the field. The hundred knights glistening in their pristine armor shouted directions to each other and worried about their battle plans. The royal green and red flag of the King proudly waved to and fro in the mild weather. However, even with all the sunny weather and chaotic commotion, an ominous feeling subconsciously invaded the atmosphere.  The clear, blue sky shuddered at the thought of ensuing fight, and brought about another gust of wind. \n\n\"*Humans always want to be the top predator it seems. I've stepped back and allowed them to continue thinking that and living their lie. But they consistently wish to make their illusion a truth. Maybe it's time I reestablished why dragons are the apex creature.*\" \n\nThe scaled behemoth roared a deafening growl and leaped into flight with its powerful hind legs and equally mighty wings. After flying a considerable height, it spit its fire aimlessly in the air to put a display for the incoming warriors. The large gusts of wind from its wings threw rocks and loose wheat all around.\n\nThe wind propelled across the dry, wheat field and filled the air with an all too familiar scent. \n\nThe veteran knights resonated courage and fury. \"Dragon...this time we will finish this.\" ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389426259","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cemta6o","link_id":"t3_1uxjq6","name":"t1_cemta6o","parent_id":"t3_1uxjq6","retrieved_on":1431894519,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

His great find, the Omega galaxy, its faint light coming from so far away that it had no right to exist at all, the once in a lifetime chance at making an indelible mark into the annals of the history of science and earning his place among the pantheon of greatest minds, was not there anymore. \n\nHis great fear at seeing what had seemed too good to be true slip through his fingers gripped his most rational of bosoms in the tightest of grips. He spared no effort in recovering his galaxy, he peered heavenwise during sleepless nights through expensive apparatuses, cajoled, bribed and finally threatened his engineers into working overtime to find whatever was wrong with the optics, called in favors with other observatories and even got NASA's Hubble into his search, all for nothing. \n\nThe worst hit good De Havermeyer when his archrival on the East Coast, professor McKitrick, not only managed to lose a galaxy as well, but had the nerve to actually publish a paper on it. De Havermeyer's misery increased when his own confirmation paper, rushed before everyone else had a chance at misplacing galaxies, only increased McKitrick's fame. \n\nMcKitrick upped the ante with another five galaxies gone, de Havermeyer lost a whole cluster, McKitrick found that galaxies went out as in the path of an expanding sphere, de Havermeyer countered that the expansion speed of that sphere is accelerating, McKitrick observed that the rate of acceleration is accelerating and before de Havermeyer had a chance to publish the most important paper in the history of mankind with a precise expansion formula, a date for the End of Earth, as well as a most ingenious theory to explain it, the odious McKitrick robbed him again by simply going live on television and letting everyone know impending doom is seven days away, in a somber yet dignified speech that not only effectively disolved the ins#BADWORDS#ution of science, but every other ins#BADWORDS#ution of polite society as well. \n\nThe defeated de Havermeyer had nothing left but to take solace in the destruction of a world so filled with injustice. \n\nA jubilant Satan gloated as God hid His Face in His Hands sighing. \"You never learn, you keep hoping for a mus#BADWORDS# seed of faith to save the day.

He never listened to any real concerns, he mostly had favorites, who may I remind you were the WORST people on the floor, and Bart Gilbert hid in his office looking up #BADWORDS# on his smart phone while we all killed ourselves every night.  \n\nMonday was his birthday.  I tried to avoid him so I didn't have to say anything to him, especially happy birthday.  I really didn't want him to have a happy b-day, let alone wanted him to work at the same place I did.  I had a major problem with a couple that wanted to use a gift card that was very very expired but of course my fearless manager comes out and takes the card and they leave me little to no tip.  \n\nIt's a custom at my restaurant that on someone's birthday someone has a cake for them, we all gather and sing \"Happy Birthday,\" but today everyone was either too busy or too thick headed to remember it was our manager's special day.  Once we figured it out, we sent our least liked employee, Ninny(not sure if that's his real name or a nickname) to get an ice cream cake for our unliked leader.  \n\nWhen Mr. Gilbert saw the cake he was moved to a speech, which included how much we meant to him(not true), how valuable we were(total #BADWORDS#) and that the employees present are all on his goodlist(a #BADWORDS# lie if I ever heard one).  We sang a dishearted birthday song to him in between taking orders from our tables, or getting iced tea ready for thirsty guests, or taking a second before we dropped desserts and printed checks.  \n\nMr. Gilbert took his glasses off and wiped a tear away.  He looked down on the floor then up to the ceiling and said, \"Each one of you has a special place in my heart.\" It could have been special.  It could have been meaningful, if he wasn't such a son of a #BADWORDS#.  But he was a douche, and we reacted appropriately.  \n\nWhile he was wiping his tears away, everyone burst into laughter.

But once the story popped into my head, I figured I'd write it anyway.*\n\n\"Man, it's hot in here.\" Alan said, jamming his thumb down on the help button.\n\nIt had been no more than five minutes, and this idiot had said that at least twenty times, Paul thought. Look at him. Overweight. Balding. His clothes are cheap.  Christ, he's already sweating through his shirt.  What floor did this schmuck work on, anyway?\n\n\"I don't think the button is working.\" Alan said as he put his hands on his hips and sighed.  \"Alan.\" He extended a hand.\n\nPaul hestiated and then reached out.  \"Paul Goldfarm.\"\n\n\"Mr. Goldfarm? CEO?\"\n\nPaul nodded and raised his eyebrows.  Did the Armani suit and Rolex watch not give that away?  How many Paul Goldfarms did this moron think worked in the building?\n\n\"Never thought I'd be trapped in an elevator with a millionaire.\" Alan smiled.\n\nBillionaire, you #BADWORDS#. \"I'm just another guy at work.\" Paul said with a smile and shrug. \"I will admit, it is a little embarassing...this happening in my building.\"\n\n\"Yeah.  What can you do?\"\n\nA low rumble echoed through the elevator.  It was followed by sharp screams.  \"That doesn't sound good.\" Alan said.\n\nThanks for that, Captain Obvious.  \"No. No it did not.\" Paul said.\n\nThere were more shrieks.  \"That sounds close.\" Alan said, leaning to put his ear against the elevator door. \"I wonder...\" He began to pry at the doors.\n\nIs this guy really trying to force the doors open?  What kind of imbecile - wait, they're moving.  Paul stepped forward and began to tug at the doors as well.  As the doors eased apart, smoke drifted into the elevator.\n\n\"Something's on fire.\" Paul said.  Great, now he was doing it too.\n\n\"Just more of a reason to get out of here, Mr. Goldfarm.\"\n\nAs they pried the doors open, they could see that the elevator had stopped between floors.  Paul stood for a moment, befuddled.  Alan immediately began trying to pry the outer doors open of the upper floor.  Paul again followed Alan's lead and started yanking on the door.\n\nWhatever this is, Paul thought, it's almost over.  I will be free of this idiot.  Taking the stairs is inconvenient, but I'm in far better shape to do it than Alan.  That is for certain.  Insurance will cover the fire.  It would be a shame if someone died, but insurance covers that too.  That's why we pay those ridiculous premiums, after all.\n\nThe doors slid open.  The room in front of them was full of smoke.  \"Jesus Christ, would you look at that?\" Alan said.\n\n\"What? All I see is smoke.\"\n\n\"That.\" Alan pointed.  Paul's gaze followed the finger and fell upon people lying on the floor.  They were gathered in a still pile.  There was blood smeared over all of them.  \n\n\"What in the world?\" Paul said.  \n\nThe smoke grew thicker, obscuring their view of the bodies.  There was a loud thud, and then the sound of something dragging along the floor.  Paul squinted.  He could see a tall pale figure moving through the haze.  \n\n\"Did you see that guy?\" Alan asked.\n\n\"Do you think he's a firefighter by any chance?\" Paul asked in return.\n\n\"Maybe.\" Alan began to reach for the ledge.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"We can't stay here, Mr. Goldfarm.\"\n\nRight.  Let him go inspect the situation.  He is obviously a man of action.  I can appreciate that, Paul thought.  This is the kind of man that you need on your board.  Not the old stodgy fellows who insist on waiting on stock reports before doing anything.  Although, if that happened, I would have to talk to him with frequency.  He did seem to be some sort of dullard.  He was probably best suited for his current position.  He was expendable.  Yes, expendable.  \n\n\"Yes, go.\" Paul said.  \"See if you can find that firefighter.\"\n\n\"But, the smoke...You really should get out of the elevator.\"\n\n\"I will.  If you don't come back with the firefighter, I'll go through the bottom.\" Paul pointed to the doors of the lower floor.\n\n\"Okay.  I'll be right back.\"  Alan said.  With a grunt he hoisted himself on to the floor.  A moment later, he had disappeared into the haze.\n\nPaul stared into the smoke.  He heard someone whisper \"Oh no. Please.\"  Was that Alan?  What did he see?  There was another thud noise.  More dragging.  The tall figure reappeared.  The smoke parted for him and followed in wispy trails.\n\nPaul gazed at this pale figure.  He was impossibly tall. Impossibly skinny.  From it's back protruded flesh covered bones that fanned out in the shape of wings.  The pale skin of it's torso was washed in blood. \n\n\"Alan? Alan where are you?\" Paul said in a whisper as he backed into the corner of the elevator.\n\nThe thing raised its head and sniffed the air.  Slowly, it turned its head to the open elevator door.  With cold, black eyes it inspected the man quivering in the box.  It shrieked revealing row upon row of jagged teeth.  It began to move toward Paul.\n\n\"Alan...please come back.\"  Paul slid into the floor.\n\nThe creature stuck it's head into the elevator and paused.  It tilted it's head back and forth.  This one, it thought.  Yes, this one is expendable.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389466534","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cen2gcc","link_id":"t3_1uywh0","name":"t1_cen2gcc","parent_id":"t3_1uywh0","retrieved_on":1431898846,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Why would they… I mean why us. Why here, there are so many other places to invade” stammered the American ambassador, at a loss for words for the first time in his career. \n\nNormally smoking was banned in this room, but no one complained when he pulled out his first cigarette in fifteen years. Once again silence fell on the room like a heavy cloak, broken up only by the slow, nervous taping of a pen on the table. The silence seemed timeless, like they had all vowed they would die before it was broken, until finally someone spoke up.\n\n“We have to fight it, somehow. Use nukes maybe. Or launch a boarding party with the best soldiers in the world. We can’t just sit back and let them subjugate us like that.” The suggestion of violence was unheard of, coming from Switzerland. As people pondered the proposal, once again silence fell. Tap. Tap. Tap. They had all known what was coming but no one wanted to be the one to suggest it. Tap. They all knew how the rest of the conversation would go to. Once nukes were brought up someone would invariable mention the hackings.\n\n“We can’t use nukes ok. We just can’t take that chance again. After they destroyed the guidance system of the last one remotely, we’re just lucky it fell on a relatively empty section of Ca#BADWORDS#a. The same thing would happen if we launched a boarding party. These aliens have us so helplessly out classed technologically, we have no choice but to sit back and let our planet get taken.”\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n“Well…” spouted the Iranian ambassador. “We could always choose how we go out… We have enough nukes in different locations, we could simply carpet bomb the earth. If we can’t win then they shouldn’t either.”\n\nTap. Tap. None of this was new, every single person in the room had already considered all the options, but not everyone was willing to go down without a fight. Tap.\n\n“What about… well we could ask God for help?” muttered England.\n\n“Oui, that’s it! It’s a test from God. He wants to know how his children will respond to the ultimate test of faith. We must place our faith in god to save us from them!” proclaimed France rather loudly.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n“Germany is not willing to place its faith in an imaginary deity. We will fight to the very last man, woman, and child. And if we get to the end, and we seem to have lost, we will take the rest of the world with us. It’s better to die in a moment of fiery patriotism then to live on in chains.”\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n“That sounds like you guys are closer to fascism then patriotism” spouts someone from the side.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n“We must tell the aliens of God, that he will protect us from them, unless they join us in worship” declared France.\n\n“If you want the aliens to die of laughter that might be a solution. No civilization capable of space travel must still believe in God” Germany responded.\n\n“No civilization could have attained space travel without god.” This time it was the USA.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n“So which one then?” Ca#BADWORDS#a questioned.\n\n“Which what?”\n\n“Earth has hundreds of Gods, which one do we tell them about then?”\n\n“It must be Allah of course, for he is a merciful God and they will recognize that” declared the UAE immediately, while all of the Islamic countries nodded in agreement.\n\n“If we tell them of Allah, God won’t protect us from them because we would be worshipping a false prophet” countered one of the Christian countries.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what god we tell them about, prayers can’t protect us from an actual threat.”\n\nTap. Tap. \n\n“WHO THE #BADWORDS# KEEPS TAPPING THAT #BADWORDS# PEN!!” America explodes, and responds with a characteristic show of force. “The next person to make a sound is getting nuked!”\n\nRussia, who’s been sitting in silence at the back, finally chimes in.\n\n“Damn it America, you can’t push us around anymore. You’re not the only one with nukes”\n\n“We have bigger problems then who’s tapping a pen at a meeting. We are about to be INVADED. Let’s focus on the actual issues here.” Germany, always the voice of reason. “Like which one of you bas#BADWORDS#s thinks dying for your country is equivalent to Hitler being back in charge. Americans die for their country all the time under the guise of patriotism. Wait that’s actually a bad example.”\n\n“Are you calling us fascists Germany?

{"archived":true,"author":"decerian","body":"**Warning, wall of text. Mostly unedited**\n\nI woke up this morning in a rather peculiar way. I was suspended upside down, floating in mid-air just outside of the dorm room window. It seems I assumed correctly that just like regular school, magic school dorm rooms are rife with bullying. At least they left my clothes on this time.\n\nAs I’m struggling to reach the windowsill, I take a moment to observe my surroundings. My dorm room is one of three small cottages lined up, in the middle of a lush, vibrant forest. The nature seems to like all the ambient magic in the air, because it has no problem crawling all over the cottages, and providing a natural camouflage from any normal that happens to stumble by. Aside from three leaf covered cottages in the middle of the woods, nothing looks particularly out of the ordinary. The three cottages, each no bigger than a single room in size, have labels declaring boys, girls, and school house. I finally reach the windowsill of the boys cottage again, and as I’m crawling inside, I admire once again how effective reduction magic is in making dorm room big enough for over a thousand boys fit inside a one room cottage.\n\nI make it through the rest of my morning routine without further interruption, before heading off to my first class of day, Necromancy. The professor starts spending the lecture talking about the responsibility involved in raising the dead. Blah blah blah. I know I’m supposed to care about this, but I’ll never get a job in the industry anyway. I mean who would want to be a psychic and spend all of their time helping out mortals. The girl beside me however, is practically falling off the edge of her seat.\n\n“You like necromancy then?” I whisper over.\nAlmost immediately she shushes me. Undeterred, I try again.\n\n“So what’s your name? I’m Roger.”\nShe glances over at me with disdain.\n\n“Well then Roger, please shut up. I really need to learn this stuff”\nNow any normal mage would recognize that she didn’t like me, but with the social competency of an ox I press on.\n\n“So I guess your parents died then?”\n\n“WHAT!?!? Why would you say that?” she responds. Undeterred, the professor continues talking about how to not hurt the dead people’s feelings.\n\n“Well… you probably want to raise the dead so you can see them again. I mean I would too.”\n\n“That’s a terrible thing to say; of course my parents are still alive. I just, well you know, want to ask them what it’s like.”\n\n“Why would you want to ask your parents what not being dead is like? Don’t you already know what it’s like? Or are you dead? Oh my god if you’re dead that would be pretty cool”\n\n“No you imbecile. I’m not dead. But I will be someday, and that keeps me awake at night. I can’t sleep knowing that one day I might not wake up. Even with the most powerful magic in the world, you can’t live forever. But if I knew that dying might not be the end, that even after I’m dead I might still have something to look forward to, well then maybe I could enjoy life while it lasts. You know take risks to have fun. I can’t stay in my room forever. So that’s why I have to ask someone dead… what it’s like.”\n\n“Oh…” Understandably I’m at a loss for words, but as I’m squirming around for something to say the bell rings.\n\n“While, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then Roger” she says. “By the way, I’m Alice”\n\nAs I’m walking to the next class, I’m turning over thoughts in my head. The school house, which changes environments depending on the mood of the head master, was filled with the unending cacophony of birds screeching overhead. The air was so thick I was practically swimming through it, and I start to wonder if the normal would like us if they knew we existed. Then I remember what happened in Salem to a couple young witches who tried to help a grieving mother by allowing her to talk to her son one last time. By the time I’m done pondering, I’ve made it through the jungle to my next class, Pyromancy. \n\nThe professor talk quickly about the history of pyromancy, how we helped all the normal develop by giving them fire, and how they still worship it in a way by building machines to emulate our magic. He produces one such machine, and says it’s called a “lighter”. In the most impressive thing I’ve seen so far today he flicks it and produces a flame, before shouting for the entire world to hear “Science!”\nHe gives the lighter to the class, so that we could have a chance to see it, before continuing to talk about the dangers of fire and how to control it if it ever got out of hand.\n\n“Ok, so you must understand what to do if you ever get set on fire” said Professor Nye. “You must summon water and drench yourself in it; it will almost always put out the fire. Before we learn how to summon fire, we must of course start summoning water”\n\n“FIRE!!” shouts a voice from the back of the class.\n\n“Yes! That’s the spirit fire! But water first of course” responds Professor Nye.\n\n“FIRE!!” again shouts the voice from the back of the class, this time running crazily towards the front of the class, flaming robe in tow. At the back of the class a fire crazed warlock is using the lighter to attempt to set another students robe on fire.\n\nAfter the fire was dealt with and the student disciplined, with the lighter sitting disassembled on his desk, Professor Nye was too shaken up to finish the class so he dismissed us with a meek “See you tomorrow…”\n\nThe next class, cooking, started rather uneventfully. The professor, also on his first day at the school started to explain to us how we can use magic to conjure food into existence, before he was interrupted by a rather rotund young boy sitting off in the corner.\n\n“Professor” he started. “where does the food come from?”\n\n“Excuse me?” she replied. “It comes from magic you see. We channel the magical energy through our bodies and form it into food”\n\n“But then where does the magical energy come from?” he came back, genuinely curious. “I used to go to normal school, before I came here you see. They taught me that you can’t make something out of nothing. I understand the food comes from magic, but then where does the magic come from.”\n\nThe professor, when confronted with a logical query he could not explain, sat stumped for the rest of the class. I would later be informed that the professor did not utter a single word before he eventually proclaimed completely unexpectedly five years later “42”. He of course spent the rest of his life in a ward in the hospital specializing in those people who have encountered logic they cannot explain and could not adapt to.\n\nThe last class of the day, Illusions, started off with the same smart-ass round kid trying to stump the Illusions professor. The professor, who was much more experienced then the cooking instructor, was prepared for this smart-assery. Not five words had left his mouth before he found he longer had a mouth.\n\n“Now with that taken care of, let us begin the class.” With the energy of a man who adored being the center of attention, and knew just what to say, he commanded the vision of all the students.\n\n“You!” he said pointing at me. “Yes you, what’s your name.”\n\n“Roger…” I stammer out.\n\n“Alright Roger, would you come up here please. There we go, yes that’s great Roger. So tell me, first day of the school year, have you enjoyed it yet?”\n\n“Well… I had my philosophical base shaken twice and almost get set on fire, so it wasn’t great…”\n\n“Well Roger, I think we can change that here. Do you know what an illusion is?”\n\n“Isn’t it like, you know a trick?”\n\n“No Roger, a trick is something a… maybe that’s not appropriate for you, so I’ve got a better idea” he says as he reaches into his robe pocket. “Roger this is a deck of cards. Now I want you to grab any card from the deck and look at it, but don’t show it to me.”\nI reach up and grab a card. On the back side all of the cards are identical, but on the front I see the number two with a little heart beside it.\n\n“Ok Roger, I want you to remember that card. Got it Roger?” I nod. \n\n“Ok look at me. Now look back at the card. Your card is now a rabbit.” Magically I’m no longer holding a card, but a rabbit. “Now look back at me. I’m now half horse.” When I look back up at him, I realise the Professor is now a centaur. “Now look back at your hands.” Now I’m holding two rabbits. “And back at me.” He’s now a centaur riding an elephant in the middle of the class. “And finally back at your hands.” I scream as I realize I’m now holding onto two still beating hearts. The last thing I remember before passing out is him laughing and stammering “Gets them every time.”\n\nI wake up a few hours later and think back to my first day. At least in pyromancy I didn’t get set on fire.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389482960","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cen8xk3","link_id":"t3_1uz7t7","name":"t1_cen8xk3","parent_id":"t1_cen41dy","retrieved_on":1431902001,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

He was really spooked or like, just really excited, or on something. I dunno.\nSo Damon came over to my place and then we went out to meet Josh. We met him outside of the local Wal-Mart, made a stop at some liquor store, and then drove out somewhere with a 6-pack of Jack Daniels. We stopped in the parking lot of one of those 24/7 mini-marts on the side of some interstate highway, and the three of us sat in Damons old VW Corrado. The thing is, or was, a piece of crap.

Anyway, he shoves a ski mask and a gun into our hands and tells us to put the mask on and something about the gun not working or something.

{"archived":true,"author":"MrCadwallader","body":"\"God?\" I managed to squeeze out between raggedy breaths. \n\nI had never been very religious but in my delirium, that was my first thought. I remember the sky and the taste of blood before my eyes opened to pure brightness. I couldn't make out any detail but the light seemed to emanate from a winged, human-like figure. Were those horns or was it a halo? It all became blurry as tears welled up in my burning eyes. Even closed, I could see the figure seared blue-green into my eyelids.\n\nPeals of thunder exploded in my brain, one after another like machine gun fire. It sounded #BADWORDS#uely like laughter. It wasn't a voice that responded but my body. It felt like invisible hands had gripped my ribs, my heart and stomach. Overwhelming nausea washed over me and I screamed as my body convulsed with pain.\n\n\"NO!\"\n\nAll at once the pain stopped. It seemed I had answered my own question. I remained quiet, fearful that any further probing would result in more physical anguish. After some time a voice spoke out.\n\n\"You disappoint me. He was wrong about so many things. And yet right about others.\"\n\nI was terrified but eventually curiosity overcame the memory of pain. \n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked timidly.\n\n\"He was the Creator but I gave you knowledge. I have been called deceiver and antagonist. I believe that these days you call me -\"\n\n\"Lucifer,\" it came out of my mouth as a whisper. \n\n\"Indeed.\" The voice responded.\n\nFor a moment I thought I was in hell. There was nothing here except for brightness. I could feel the presence but the human-like figure had gone. Perhaps I had just imagined it. \n\nI simply sat there for some time. It felt like centuries at the time but looking back now it was only a few moments before I became restless.\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nThe voice responded for the last time, \"Do as you will.\"\n\nSo I did.\n\nThere was something special about this place in the early days. Everything was malleable. At first the silliest things please you. I've lived multiple lifetimes as James Bond, I became the world's greatest rockstar and a pro-athlete sometimes all at the same time. Of course, I've slept with literally millions of women. Men too. I've tried it all. From the sickest and most twisted, fastest and reckless to thousands of lazy, hazy Sundays. BBQs with family on sunny days to walking on the moon and slaying Ctulhu of the Deep. \n\nNone of that interests me anymore. I did not want to be the star anymore, so I became the director. I built my own universe from scratch. I created servants that would unflinchingly carry out my will and sing my praises eternally. I made a world and watched it grow but even that lost it's lustre.\n\nIn the end, there was only one thing left to do. I created my equal. And it was good. For the first time in a very long time I don't know what is going to happen. I see him ahead, my broken servants at his feet. And now he comes for me.\n***\nLucifer watched on.

{"archived":true,"author":"Static_and_#BADWORDS#","body":"It was a small, quiet room, only burdened with three armchairs, a small table and a liquor cabinet. The curtains were drawn on the only window - there was nothing to see in the night - and the door was shut. Three men were sitting, each with a glass in his hands and not one either full or empty. The unbranded glass bottle on the table only contained enough whiskey for one more drink. \n\nOf the three men, one was remarkable for his height. Even in a sitting position his head was inches above the others’, and his crossed legs seemed to be longer than one’s own body. His name was Jules and he liked being called so, not caring for nicknames or other childish endeavours of the sort. Jules had so far been the heaviest drinker and yet not an iota of his behaviour had changed, and his pale skin was the same #BADWORDS#geneous colour it always was. His two companions both secretly wondered if his height diluted the alcohol somewhat, or if their friend was simply naturally drunk and so used to it he could compensate to appear normal. An act would certainly explain some of his rigidity!\n\nThe man on Jules’ left only stood out when observed at the side of his tall friend: Dennis, who held true loathing for his name and preferred to be called “Hey, you there” rather than his parents’ choice, had a height barely below the average. Such a difference was easy to overlook most days, but not in present company. Dennis was quite simply drunk. He hadn’t sipped half his own left neighbor’s intake and already acted like he’d downed a bottle, which he had not, before meeting with his old friends and colleagues. Said friends and colleagues were ready to be firm with “Him” if he reached for the bottle.\n\nThe third and last man, an Italian going by the name of Armenegildo, felt like he was keeping a zoo. A very likeable zoo, but the stern giraffe on his left and the emotional clown on his right could easily get on his nerves from time to time. Still, the company could be good if Jules was thirstier than usual and Dennis was tired enough to behave. This was the main reason why they always met after sunset. Armenegildo, gifted with a peculiar name, would go depending on his company by “Arme”, “Gigi”, “Gildo”, or any other combination of the mul#BADWORDS#ude of syllables available. “Gigi” was Dennis’ favourite.\n\nThe three were enjoying a comfortable silence after having shared a few stories - although “He” was also starting to fall asleep at the drop in rhythm of the conversation - when Armenegildo spoke up:\n\n“I assume you both remember the bombing in Lilles, last month.”\n\nJules nodded and the other seemed to be somewhat agreeing as he turned his brain back on, so the Italian continued:\n\n“A terrorist whose affiliations were never discovered,” he saw the taller half of his audience raise an eyebrow and added “,not conclusively at least, but most of all a foiled attack. Dino Harper, the immigrated son of an Italo-American immigrant woman, come back to his origins’ continent though in the country next door, tackled a suicide bomber when dozens froze in terror. The only two deaths are the expected, and three bystanders were lightly hit by schrapnel.”\n\n“We read the newpaper too, Gigi!” was the tipsier answer, and “Disaster averted, but a tragedy nonetheless. Why are you bringing this up?” the more sensible one.\n\nArmenegildo took a second to consider his wording and resumed the story:\n\n“I’ve heard a very interesting anecdote concerning this piece of news, just yes#BADWORDS#ay: Dino was Italian by blood, and thus quite a seductor,” Dennis giggled, only slightly manlier than a girlscout in his drunken haze, “so you can imagine he had a girlfriend at the time. A girlfriend with whom he had shared a beautiful relationship for a long time, several years. We are though speaking of a relationship he nearly ruined once, by cheating.”\n\nThis time his audience was quieter, in respect for the storyteller of the moment: it was a tradition of sorts, the kind that establishes itself, uncalled for but that couldn’t be done without, of their restricted group. Once a story gets going, there is no outright interrupting. It of course didn’t stop Dennis from breathing in sharply, with how easily involved he could get in someone else’s drama.  \n\n“It was a very hard time for both sides of the couple, wounded trust on one side and boundless guilt on the other. It went farther than anyone expected, both losing most of their friends in their broken states, leaving them alone in a time of need. The crescendo of disaster reached its end when, via a phonecall she initiated, an emotional Sandra Thorton forgave her boyfriend. She forgave him and, as he hanged up, he stepped from from the edge of the roof he was standing, ready to go back to his car the fastest way there is.”\n\nDennis was stunned, eyes glinting with hinted tears at the romance he was still living through an intoxicated imagination. Jules smiled and, seeing Armenegildo had decided to let his friends work the implications of his words, spoke:\n\n“Some time later, Dino gives his life to a better cause, saving what the police estimated as over twenty men and women. Remarkable!”\n\n“I thought so.”\n\nThe poor Dennis was too overwhelmed to join in.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389540764","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cenoqfy","link_id":"t3_1uyjj3","name":"t1_cenoqfy","parent_id":"t1_cen9s2d","retrieved_on":1431909721,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

I try again and this time it catches, illuminating a small circle of nothingness around me. I stow away the rest of the pack and move the match to my left hand, using my right to find the wall that's been my only companion for the last hour. I press forward once again, my feet sloshing in the foul-smelling mixture that flows under me at a steady pace. A mix of oil, feces, trash, circuits. The refuse of both man and machine, some of it probably radioactive. I try not to cough and keep going.\n\nI reach a junction and sit down to rest, staring at the match. It was called a \"match\" only for archaic purposes, for it shared no characteristics with its early wooden counterpart. It burned clean, leaving nothing behind and lasted for up to two hours. Its most important feature, however, was probably that it didn't emit heat. Heat  is bad. Heat is how they see you, through stone and metal, heat is how they know where you are. Not who you are, necessarily, but that wasn't very important to them, that could be found out after you were discovered and restrained. Iden#BADWORDS#y was easily taken away so what we guarded more was location. \n\nI stick the candle into the slime covering the wall and take off my backpack. Civilization hadn't done much right but we finally managed to get food down to the bare essentials. I take out a bottle of pills and swallow one, washing it down with some melted crystallized water. A slight hiss came from the water bottle when I held it in my slimy hands. Anything metal was damaged down here (one of the reasons so many people worked to keep these tunnels open and ward off the guardians) but a depressurizer was the one thing nobody should be caught without--drinking anything suspect, or trying to filter any of this filth meant an agonizing death. I finished drinking the required dose and put away the container. This should get me going for the rest of the day...or was this night? I sigh quietly. This journey is taking me longer than I thought it would. I accepted never being able to see the sun again in  exchange for greater freedom but I didn't intend on spending the rest of my life in this slime. \n\nI put my backpack back on, retrieved my match and turned right, heading further into darkness.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389572342","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceo1xmx","link_id":"t3_1v2b4n","name":"t1_ceo1xmx","parent_id":"t3_1v2b4n","retrieved_on":1431916014,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

She hadn't had time to bolt the front door.  She heard it creak open from down the hall, and then one cautious footfall, then another, then another.  Ten little eyes turned upward in the dark.\n\nIt was headed into the kitchen with another behind it.  Another board squeaked near the cupboard, and then another set of stealthy boots sc#BADWORDS# off to the right toward the bedrooms.  Three inside, maybe four, and God only know how many outside.  There was a breathless pause, a quick prayer, and from somewhere she heard a drawer slide out.  \n\n*They won't find it.  They won't find it and they won't find* us *and they'll take their filthy business down the road.*\n\nA red light pierced the shadows in a fine thin line.

There was the slow, lethal *shick* of a blade being unsheathed from somewhere above, and then the ripping of canvas, quick and jagged and precise.  Another pair of footfalls whispered down the hall toward them.  Paper rustled and crumpled and fell to the floor, and then a low, gruff voice grunted something indiscernible.  \n\nShe saw the point of the laser appear only once more, now retreating, and for the first time in what seemed like an hour, she breathed.  There was silence, welcome and unbroken from time to time only when one of them shifted its weight in the living room.  They were going to be alright.\n\nShe heard the distant cry from outside as if it were a ringing bell, and in a split second she also knew what it meant.  *Contact right!*\n\nThere was a knock against the wall in the hallway, and then another pinhole of artificial white light appeared through the cracks in the floor.  It was larger and more jagged than the laser, and it never moved.  Another knock, another violent pinhole of light, and then the alarming *crack-crack-crack* of rifles from the front of the house.  \n\n\"Hey hey hey!\" one of them called from above, and then they were scrambling, \"Secure everything!  Do#BADWORDS#ents, hard drives, photos.  #BADWORDS#!  We're out of here in 30!\"\n\nSomeone on the front lawn started to scream.  Another coin-sized beam of light filtered down through the cracks.  Heavy stomping everywhere, always away from them, and through the popping and crackling and barking of orders she heard the cries get louder, more desperate, until they broke the threshold and filled the air around them.\n\n\"Alright alright alright, don't move it.  You're gonna be okay, just don't move,\" one of them said.  There was some struggle, more stomping, and then something heavy slid down the hallway.  She watched as the beams of light disappeared one by one.  \"Don't move!\"  \n\nCoughing, spitting, moaning.  More red filling the gaps now, but not light.  She watched it fall through hazy space and patter against the dirt.  It pooled quickly, darkly.\n\nThere was some sudden force from nowhere, a distant *whup-whup-whup* which grew from nothing and bore down upon them with all the force of a hurricane.  The building shook and dust whipped through the air and the stark everywhere light panned over them, searching.  One of the children scurried over to her and buried his face into her shoulder, then another.  She tried to stop them but it was too late.  Five little hearts pounded against her, so silent and yet so profound.\n\nIt was a chaotic symphony, a terrible looming bulkhead of gunfire and yelling and pain and smoke and soot, and then it was gone.  It was over.  All was silent.\n\nFive pairs of eyes, ten little noses, pudgy little cheeks now close enough to kiss.  She wrapped them all up in her arms and just sat there, and their breathing against her was like a distant ocean, serene, ethereal.  She didn't know how long she'd been crying, but she continued for some time.

They said that he a decision would be made at 10:00am, and now it was 10:10. *How long does it take to pick up the damn phone and punch in 7 numbers* He did not like being made to wait, but he wasn’t really in a position to be making demands.  It all started last week with an honest mistake.  \n\nAs a special agent for the FBI, he had been wrapping up a particularly mundane interstate criminal activity case. Some idiot back country kids had started boosting cars and moving them to the next town over. They never stopped to think that since they crossed a state line they were committing a federal crime. Anyway, the whole operation was so poorly orchestrated that all the evidence fit into a single white cardboard box. Why he decided to take the evidence to the locker himself he couldn’t remember. They had runners on staff, but sometimes a man just wants to stretch his legs and do his own work.  \n\nIn the evidence cage, he slid his box into the correct spot and was almost out the door when something caught his eye. He knew the rules. Never look in boxes aren’t part of your case. If you didn’t need to know, then keep your nose out of it, but something dragged him back into the room. He couldn’t even recall what exactly happened, but he must have opened a box. His partner Sammy later told him that a runner found him bare ass naked on the floor eating some kind of unidentified green #BADWORDS#. Apparently it the scene was pretty grisly since they took him straight to the hospital and locked down the whole building. Sammy had tried to track the runner down to question him some more, but he too had vanished. \n\nThe doctors checked him out, gave him a clean bill of health and sent him on his way. The FBI higher ups told him to stay in his house and wait for a call Monday at 10am. They must have been serious. They took his side arm and posted three agents to babysit him. Well now it was 10 am and there still wasn't a call. “Calm down man” He said to himself. “They’re just going to put you on suspension.

{"archived":true,"author":"all-the-bees","body":"She was smaller than I'd imagined. When I'd dashed down 5'4 on her sheet, I hadn't really anticipated just how pe#BADWORDS#e that actually was. I couldn't help but bite my lip with excitement, though, and try to suppress a decidedly girlish noise of insane delight. Here she was. I'd spent hours, hundreds of hours, of my own life to create hers. In an inexplicably platonic way, I wanted to reach out and touch her shoulder length auburn hair, the slight frizz creating a sort of halo effect around her pale face. I wanted to hold her fingers in mine, to really look into her eyes—which I had, somewhat cheesily, described as being the shade of emeralds—and see everything she was and, more than that, everything I knew she would be. I wanted to coddle her in the way that one does their newborn baby—fascinated and delighted with every mundane aspect of their being—because she was, in so many ways, just that. Despite being several years my senior, she was the child of my imagination that I had been in love with since the day I conceived her and my heart was bursting. \n\t\n\nTrue to our own individual fashions, however, we both simply stood there awkwardly, eyes on the floor, small nervous smiles on our lips, and both very uncertain what to say. There is a mutual shuffling of feet and we both give a nervous half laugh and finally look at each other. “Astoreth...”\n\t\n\n“Call me, ah, Astor,” she interjects, voice soft. The girlish noise I'd been trying to hold in earlier escapes and I nod in that sort of overly enthusiastic way. I can tell that my fascination with her is making her a little uncomfortable—she's never been one for attention—but I can hardly help it.\n\t\n\n“Astor, of course...” I trail off, uncertain just how to put everything I want to tell her, to ask her. What she has in store for her, the answers to all her questions, the reasons for all her heartbreaks, and just how amazing she will eventually grow to be. “You'll save lives, you know. Have more children.” Her eyes flick briefly up to meet mine—and they are an intensely captivating green--widening slightly before she drops her gaze back to the floor, a very pleased little smile appearing to accompany the slight blush brushing across her cheeks. \n\t\n\nDespite my own introverted tendencies, I reach out to take her cool fingers in my warm ones and hold them tightly. After a long moment, she returns the grip. I can almost feel the uncertainty radiating from her. After all, here is someone who knows, quite literally, everything about her. I knew her struggles growing up with her mother, of coming to terms with the death of her father, of struggling with her addictions and of her triumphs in finding her own way. I'd seen into the most intimate moments of her life—her love with Jayce, their daughter, the subsequent pain of their parting and then the intensity of coming together with Corvan, her true to life soul mate, and beginning their life together. I'd watched as she lost friends and allies, traveled far from home to alien planets and fought for not only her own life, but the lives of those with her. I'd been there as she'd begun her journey to discover her true inner strengths and just what kind of power she was capable of. \n\t\n\nAnd she knew nothing of me. Only that I had created her. And, to me, she was absolutely perfectly imperfect. I think she sensed that I wanted to tell her more because she gave my hands a small squeeze along with one of her small, reassuring smiles “I know. Thank you.”\n\t\n\nI could see why that smile always melted Corvan. It was subtle, but there was such power beneath it. Despite her outer awkwardness, this was a woman who knew what she was doing. Where she was going, even if she didn't know what was at the other end, and who was going to accompany her on the long journey there. If her heart ever did waiver, she was surrounded with extraordinary people who cared and would help keep her on the right path.\n\t\n\nGently removing her hands from mine, she gives me a look. It's a look that I know means she has to go. I feel tears suddenly well, hot and damp, and close my eyes tightly. A deep breath. When I open them again, she is gone. There is a sharp pang of sudden loneliness before I turn to throw myself into my computer chair and begin typing.\n\n010","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389642909","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceonscp","link_id":"t3_1uoxy3","name":"t1_ceonscp","parent_id":"t3_1uoxy3","retrieved_on":1431926536,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

It retracted back into the wall, but it had been enough. He would have to kill this one now. It was a shame too. Roger had always been such a gentle and kind pet. But, after all, it was for the greater good, and he could not allow information of this magnitude to be leaked out.

My heart pounded in my ears. I heard the blood rush through my veins, crying out in desperation at what could've been my last moments of reality. The orchestra of my body filled the otherwise silent room with a nervous symphony; it echoed off the white walls and the white door, crashed through the ceiling and tumbled down around my head. The three buttons waited, ominous glows in the whitewash.\n\n\"Sir!\" The voice boomed again, now filled with an authoritative edge. \"Please make a choice.\" \n\nI was born a Normal. My father's father had been invincible, but my old man had taken his humanity. My mother, too.

I'd discussed my choice with my parents. We decided that I too should choose invincibility, so as to ensure I live my life to the fullest with as many opportunities as I could have.

It's very early morning and I'm sloppy so excuse me for that.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nNo, he was being absurd. Weak. Immortality and invincibility were the only two real options and though Chris knew for certain he'd choose the latter the stress of the final day had worn him out. Tomorrow he would make his final choice and step up to the Unyielding gate, its twisted steel bars wrought by the hands of the very kin whose footfalls he'll soon follow.\n\n\n\nEach lifestyle had various and prominent schools and factions but the most important were the Undying and the Unyielding. The Unyielding made up the entirety of the super athletes and soldiers in the world. The modified biology of the Invincibles, unable to feel real pain or to be affected negatively by most chemicals, meant that they could consume as many performance enhancing drugs as they pleased so long as it was within the state-approved limit or they belonged to the Unyielding.\nChris once saw two men in the street that were rumoured to be prize fighters that had graduated from the academy of the Unyielding. One was 9 feet tall and built like a jagged boulder of muscle. He had a #BADWORDS#anium hand but despite his weight his movement was as s#BADWORDS#htly as that of a dancer. The man walking with him was two heads shorter and fashioned almost entirely out of metal. Those belonging to the Invincible lifestyle, especially entertainers, modified their bodies in strange and fantastical ways.\n\n\n\nThough the Unyielding were secretive and avoided press whenever possible, the Undying were almost myth-like in this aspect. It was suspected that all the major politicians, world leaders and business executives belonged to it but the only real knowledge held was of its Delta Academy, which hundreds of thousands of students would be turned away from every month. The prodigies were flown there as soon as they passed the arch and settled down for hundreds of years of vigorous study.\n\n\n\nChris went back to the halls feeling stupid he had almost been tricked by the old man. As he passed the lounge he heard a racket building up but he ignored it. He felt angry. Angry at the smugness of the worn, leathery face staring down at him through his flimsy glasses. The old man was content. Why? Chris walked into his room and plopped himself down on his bed without removing his shoes. \n\n\n\nJohn, his room-mate, hurled open the door excitedly.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, you heard? Oh man! Sever Lockwood is choosing normsy.\"\n\n\n\nChris could barely stifle his guffaw.\n\n\n\n\"He's doing what?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, he wants to be normal, I couldn't believe it when I heard.\"\n\n\n\n\"He's the best prodigy they've ever had. He even told me to go Immortal.\"\n\n\n\n\"Man, the kid's crazy in the head, I've always said it. You coming for drinks?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'll be down later.\"\n\n\n\nChris was stumped. How could a person so smart turn out so stupid? He put on his coat and made his way to Sever's room.\n\n\n\nSever opened the door before Chris could knock. He was expecting him.\n\n\n\n\"Sever, what the hell are you thinking?\"\n\n\n\nSever smiled ever so slightly. It was the same look the old bespectacled man had. Amused, penetrating and timeless. He pulled Chris in and closed the door.\n\n\n\n\"You felt it too. I watched you as you left the building. You had made your choice.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, you're wrong, I'm choosing Invincible.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know, it's all I ever wanted. Just a bit of peace. A bit of normality in this chaos. That's what I felt when I talked to him and I wondered if anyone else from our group would feel it too.\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you talking about, man? You've gone crazy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Greed. Unrest. Wanting more. Ever thirsting. That's human nature, that's what makes us crazy. Nothing will ever be enough. The thing that truly defines us as human is our vulnerability. Finding strength from a weak mould. Seeing the beauty in simple things. The defects of the other lifestyles illuminates this essential, primal truth about us. That's what and who the Undying truly are. Fully appreciating what we are and starting over. Though the two of us right now are as mortal as can be the human spirit lives on and will ever live on.\"\n\n\n\nWith that they were both silent for a long while and sat there brooding and watching as blue blended into pale silver and spilled through the shutters.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389681027","downs":0,"edited":"1389681578","gilded":0,"id":"cep47ni","link_id":"t3_1v5bex","name":"t1_cep47ni","parent_id":"t1_ceowl2g","retrieved_on":1431934570,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"decerian","body":"**Disclaimer, this is about Hitler's son. Even if he is gay, he's bound to have been indoctrinated to some extent**\n\nI waited a long time to tell him this. Had to wait until the perfect time, so that he was happy and tipsy, but not drunk enough to be enraged already. It was a good day for him today. The reports came from the front line saying we’d had a good day of bombing, and we’d had a lot of killings today at the camps. It was a pretty good day, after all a lot of those impure people died, and only one of my kind died.\nThe way I see it, gay people don’t affect the purity of the German master race at all. We can’t even reproduce; wait a single generation and all of will have died out. It’s the worst evolutionary advantage of all time, and I don’t even care. I only know that I’m one of them, and I still don’t care. It’s something I’ve known, and struggled with since I was seven years old. And I’ve decided it’s finally time for dad to know.\n“Dad” I started off with, trying to put him in a good mood. Anything involving him reproducing puts him in a good mood. He’s a little bit egotistical like that.\n“Dad” I continued. “It’s been a good day for the Germans. Soon enough all of Europe will be ours.”\n“Yes mein son” he replied. “You dare speak with me?”\nThank god. He’s in a fantastic mood. I could probably get away with telling him I converted to Judaism and he would laugh it off. Just like he did the last time I told him I converted, although I wasn’t joking that time. Thank god he’s such a forgiving person.\n“Mein Fuhrer” I continued. “I have discovered a flaw in his philosophies.” He continued to reinforce the idea that he was in a good mood by pulling out his gun and waving it at me. You may think that sounds weird, but trust me, he only does that after his regimes have killed a fairly large amount of people and he’s feeling #BADWORDS#y, so once again a fairly normal day.\n“Dad, I needed to tell you that I’m gay.” I of course said this at a safe distance. Only two other people in the bar got shot, so for life altering announcements that’s not so bad. Three people got shot when I told him I didn’t want to do swim lessons anymore.\nHis response to this was to vomit, but I’m not sure of it was because of happiness, or alcohol. Who am I kidding; they’re basically the same thing. After the filthy brown eyed server had come over and cleaned it up, I continued.\n“Dad, the thing about gays is that you don’t even have to bother killing us off, give it two generations and we’ll all be dead. I’ve thought about this a lot, and Charles Darwin had some good ideas, traits are truly passed on from the parents, there’s a lot of evidence to support this. So if you just allow all the gays to live, killing us won’t even be on your consciences.” I did spend a lot of time thinking about this. I needed a way to come out to him without dying because of it, and I think this is the perfect way. Evolution happens over many generations, so two or three will hardly even affect the gene pool, if at all.\n“So mein son, what you’re saying is that you’ve figured out a better way to kill off all the gays efficiently.” Oh god, he’s a bit too drunk. “That’s fantastic, tomorrow morning I will announce that you have been appointed as the head of gay extermination. It’s a fantastic sign to see my only child following so closely in my footsteps.”\nOh god, I’m never going to get laid now.\n\n\n**-013**","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389682053","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cep4hug","link_id":"t3_1uz7t7","name":"t1_cep4hug","parent_id":"t1_cenjnbq","retrieved_on":1431934705,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Chrispy_Bites","body":"Note: I grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons, but I could never wrap my head around how an entire thinking, sapient race of things could all be \"evil\".  Our incredibly gifted GM, crafter of stories I and my friends still remember and reminisce about to this day, agreed.  This is for him.\n\n&gt; They are among us, but they are not of us. And though we weep for the loss of the beautiful jewel that was Kladdia to those brutal Molsathi invaders, the Irülean Cities are for humanity.  Not for Orrogg.  We have given them a home from the Scattering.  That is enough.\n&gt; -- from the Mouth of the High Devoted, 15 AS\n\nIn the two hundred and fiftieth year of the Scattering, the Orrogg experienced a schism, of sorts, among their kind.  Tired of a lack of agency in these strange riverlands, and entranced by the individuality enjoyed by the humans, younger generations of Orrogg began leaving their enclaves in the Cities to seek out life in and among the Irüleans.  To the traditionalist Orrogg who had formed the first enclaves at the behest of City Princes, this was deeply concerning.\n\nThe key to greatness in ruined Kladdia was specialization and dependence on the whole.  An individual Orrogg was expected to pursue their chosen life path---their *prrethan*---without distraction.  Indeed, one must become their prrethan.  If an Orrogg knows his or her place in the world then, like the intricate clockwork machinery that runs our Modern world, society functions without interruption.  Indeed, the word prrethan roughly translates to cog or gear.\n\nAn Orrogg need not worry about where the bread, or the metal, or the down for his bed come from, because a prrethan exists for those things.  He or she must only worry about his or her prrethan, and acknowledge that other prrethan depend on his or her prrethan.  All prrethan link together, and each turns the other.\n\nSo, young Orrogg leaving the enclaves to attempt assimilation among the humans cast an indelible shadow over these communities.  The Elders of the enclaves began rebranding themselves, so to speak, taking the name Wharg en Kladdia (literally, \"Children of the Kladdia\"), to remind their people where they came from and why their values are so important.  The Wharg communes became insular, tight knit, guarding the secrets of their innovations tightly, and dealing with the Cities in which they lived through chosen representatives.\n\nThose Orrogg who attempt assimilation, either in continual self-loathing or some form of irony (I confess, Orrogg humor, if it exists, is lost on me) began to refer to themselves as Tang en Kladdia.  Bas#BADWORDS#s of the Kladdia.  Their life among us in the Cities is as fascinating as it is distressing.  Some aspects of the Orrogg cultural value on specialization and perfection must be an indelible part of their race.  The Tang Orrogg are usually the best at their chosen line of work, whether it be menial or cerebral.  They are the best lawyers, the best engineers, the best physicians, the best farmers, the best hermetics.  Interestingly, I have seen no Orrogg take up sorcery, only hermetics.  I suspect this is because sorcery requires some artistry that is too ephemeral for the concrete mind of the Orrogg.  They excel at the formulae, the math of hermetic magic.\n\nIn some Cities, this greatness has fomented a great deal of ill will, jealousy, and su#BADWORDS#ion.  After all, for some, the word of the High Devoted of Jenai is synonymous with Natural Law.  In other Cities, the efforts of those Tang Orrogg has created a new understanding between Man and Orrogg.  An exchange of ideas, and a better place for the Orrogg who live there.  Regardless, the Wharg, in all Cities but mine, remain trapped in their enclaves, giving back to their City only where it benefits them.\n\nIt has been 600 years since the Molsathi invaded the Kladdian Steppes, set fire to that great and advanced civilization, and Scattered its people to the wind.  As Prince of of Moorpond, and counting Patriarch Uruk Wurghed of our Wharg Enclave a close and personal friend of mine, I think it is high time that we, rulers of these Cities, recognize the Orrogg as Irülean people, just as we are.  These kind, cultured, excellent people have given so much to our Cities.  We owe our riverboats, our carriages, our automatically tilled and tended fields, to these innovative people.  The least we can do is give them a place---a real place---among us.\n\n--- From Prince Beryn of Moorpond's *The City in the City: My Time in the Moorpond Enclave*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389697863","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cep7ec4","link_id":"t3_1v6fzl","name":"t1_cep7ec4","parent_id":"t3_1v6fzl","retrieved_on":1431936105,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":true,"author":"Micelight","body":"Eventually it wasn't willpower that pulled us away from the sound but sheer exhaustion as we kept getting up to bring the needle back to the start of the 'music.' Days had passed, the engineers and I completely transfixed by the music that flowed over us until hunger finally set in, and we motioned for the sounds to stop. Though no one got up to move the needle and instead tones of random noise shrilled through the air and finally put an end to our indulgence.\n\nIn stark contrast to what we had heard, this was chaotic and hurtful to us - an absolute atrocity that incited one of the younger engineers to leap up and tear the arm right off the 'phonograph,' leaving us in stunned silence.\n\n\"Who were they?\"\n\nAn older member of the team postured to me and for once, in all my time as a Leader of Information, I had no answer. Though he was wiser than most, a genius of design by all accounts, and observing the minute was his life.\n\n\"You recognised the language. What I don't recognise is even more telling though. The designs do not resemble anything known to us.\"\n\nStrong wording from an engineer. Yet something in his expression made me believe him. Nevertheless...\n\n\"Why should you be so sure?\"\n\n\"My father is the Leader of designs.\"\n\nThat made sense. He held a similar air to his father, a council member wrought from the strongest metals whose certainty in his knowledge saw what many thought impossible to be fabricated. Of course he'd make his son knowledgeable in such things - no doubt an heir-to-be in the near future. Still, his knowledge of designs surpassed mine, and I had to agree that it was undeniable that this Voyager was a hole in my supposedly flawless logic - a new chapter in a book; not just a footnote or an archived incident report.\n\nThe signal... the device had been directing a weak signal behind it when it had been discovered. Perhaps we could ping it back to the receiver? When I voiced this thought, the heir apparent had just given me a look that practically told me to \"keep up,\" and with that he was motioning to his team to begin work on the Voyager, ignoring \"the elephant in the room\" (fantastic expression by them, it rolls so well in a sentence) regarding our days of musical coma.\n\nI kept the disc in my possession with certainty that the chaotic sounds resembled something. Perhaps information in another format? My vision somewhat impaired by age, I would need a sensory expert to acutely report to me what the wave formations on the disc translated to. Perhaps visual cues?\n\nDays passed before my hunch proved correct. In all, 116 images were recovered through a simple analogue coding, and for the very first time, I saw what had produced the wondrous noises. Humanity. Disregarding their terribly primitive boasts of technology, they were an impressive race through their sheer diversity. Colours along an entire scale, drastic physical deviations, nearly dichotomous cultures - they were an incredible testament to the flexibility of their biology (The main 'variety event' as we named it, seems to have been when a group of their early ancestors departed from what was known as Ethiopia, leaving behind other factions. This is in stark contrast to our own evolution where we as a species remained in the same area and shared the same genetic variations, and fanned out in a coordinated manner - like ripples in liquid). Of design in themselves, they were interesting to say the least. Bipedal, their design favoured momentum through forward inertia and left them above the ground at a height sufficient to observe their environment with their sensory organs. Eyes. They had these interesting eyes that were clearly dedicated to vision, yet unlike our own calcified lenses (of which far surpass human capabilities; and appeared only in the extinct ‘trilobite’ class on their home planet) they appeared to have some soft internal structure. An outer carapace of soft tissue (skin) formed a flexible sack for their internal organs (fascinating systems with designated functions – the heart being one in particular. Our entire circulatory system operates off a pulsing mechanism similar to how the human vein works – independent of any central pump and under negative pressure, moving liquid through constrictions of the walls and a series of valves, but I digress once again) that could regenerate itself with alarming swiftness in what was surely an evolutionary boon for the human race. Other organs such as the ear were more or less the same, as there are only so many ways in which vibrations can be translated to the ‘brain,’ and I wasn’t particularly surprised to see many features of our compatriot Directorate species mirrored in non-human fauna, such as gills and outer layers facilitating cutaneous gas exchange. The wealth of medical knowledge endowed to me in a few images segeued into their own prized designs – and then ended altogether\n\n\nWhilst I was close to unprofessional levels of exultation at seeing the music makers, the absence of any military might was of the most interest to me – they seemed to completely ignore the concept of combat. What could be made of that? Divergence *always* ignited conflict. Whole planets in our colony systems lay beneath clouds of radioactive fury as a permanent testament to this, trillions of lives exterminated throughout the history of our existence for reasons that defied logical reasoning.\n\nNo. Surely they had wars. The absence of such demonstrations was one of peace. An invitation supplemented by star system maps and inscriptions detailing a relative location in the midst of 14 pulsar stars. A “return to sender” address. I informed the council. They listened to my voice of reason alone, the record kept absent from discussions, yet the Leader of Designs looked through my guise of objective reasoning the entire time – a cold, measuring stare that told me all I needed to know. He wished to design sounds of control himself, an obstacle I would counter later.\n\nWith the trace permit granted I had returned to the Voyager research facility when the engineers finally completed the preparations for a “phone home.” The internals of the device were diagnostic tools mainly, powered by a weak radioisotope cell that had somehow managed to slightly reverse the decay process and effectively recharge (perhaps a local neutron storm or solar emission laden with Proton-2 was to thank?) itself. The transmitter was boosted by our Giga Station - several ore dense planets turned into a supermassive signal array spanning an entire solar system – and we literally were waiting on the countdown, tinkering in front of the harnessed Voyager  when we heard several loud clicks fire off before we had any idea what was happening.\n\nA ‘camera’ had just imaged 13 completely foreign creatures standing in front of a captured probe holding equipment (which upon retrospect, strongly resembled human firearms) and had 'hijacked' (in reality, it was already wired and ready to send a 'nonsense' signal that could be traced) the Giga Station array to send them off to an area of designated dead space. Panic ensued. They would wake to a console in their command centre depicting a team of alien organisms bearing down on a probe which proudly had a home address on it. A diplomatic disaster? Most certainly. Something that could render us unable to ever learn the secrets of the wonderful sounds. We had to give chase.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389699019","downs":0,"edited":"1389708331","gilded":0,"id":"cep7kc2","link_id":"t3_1v3twy","name":"t1_cep7kc2","parent_id":"t1_ceojvz4","retrieved_on":1431936185,"score":11,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":11}

And besides, we prefer nuts.”\n\n“You *are* nuts if you think I’m scared of a sneaky old fox,” she said with a sniff.\n\n\nThe squirrels looked at each other, a bit concerned.\n\n\n“Well, okay,” they said, and scurried away.\n\n\n*Scaredy squirrels,* the bunny princess thought, and, now that her basket was full, made her way back home.\n\n\nOn the way there, she heard some commotion from a thicket, in the woods, nearby. It sounded like there was a mighty scrap going on, with lots of yelling and shouting. Being a princess, and a bit of a busy-body, Fluffles decided she had to interfere. She set her basket aside and hopped into the woods.\n\n\n“Oi,” she said, approaching a tangle of bushes that the yelling and shaking was coming from. “What’s going on here?”\n\n\nSuddenly, there was a flash of red fur, as something big jumped from the bushes and landed in front of her. The sneaky fox! The big red beast grinned down at her with a mouthful of wet, pointy teeth.\n\n\n“Well, well,” he said, in a rather elegant voice, “I daresay I’m in the presence of none other than princess *Dinner.*”\n\n“Back off you creepy old mutt,” she said, picking up a stick and pointing it threateningly at him.\n\n“Oh my! How frightful. Oh please, dear majestic princess, don’t harm me. I’m but a cowardly old fox, please. I surrender. I surrender.”\n\n\nFluffles, in spite of her confidence, was a little surprised.\n\n\n“Really?” she said.\n\n“Ha... no, not really.”\n\n\nThe fox leapt forward and slammed his jaws around Fluffles’ leg. The pain was instant and blinding, and Fluffles screamed as she fell to the hard earth. The fox cackled, licking the blood from his jaws. She screamed again, louder this time, causing the fox to wince.\n\n\n“Shut the #BADWORDS# up, you little #BADWORDS#,” he said, scowling at her.\n\n\nMoaning, she tried to crawl away, but the fox put a lazy paw onto her chest, easily holding her down. Her breath became frantic and ragged as his mouth opened around her. The stench of rotting meat filled her world and made her gag. She could feel consciousness slipping away when, suddenly, the fox stopped. Everything seemed to have frozen until the fox started wailing. He stumbled back, holding the spot where his eye had once been, that was now a torrent of gushing blood. Fluffles managed to pull herself u#BADWORDS#ht to see the two squirrels from earlier leap from the surrounding trees, dressed in black ninja attire, and slicing at the fox with long swords. He flailed about aimlessly, trying to hit them, but they were too fast. After performing a few spectacular somersaults, they landed in front of the princess with their blades raised.\n\n\n“Get the #BADWORDS# away from her, you piece of #BADWORDS#.”\n\n\"#BADWORDS# squirrels!\" the fox snapped, spitting blood and drool everywhere. \"I'll #BADWORDS# kill you!\"\n\n\nThe fox roared and ran at them, and the squirrels, with perfectly synchronised moves, leapt up and jammed their swords into either side of his neck. He stumbled and gargled, collapsing to the blood-stained grass, twitching one last time before finally laying still.\n\n\nFluffles’ mouth was agape, and she almost didn’t notice the pain in her leg anymore. The squirrel warriors approached her and helped her up.\n\n\n“Let’s get the #BADWORDS# outta here,” she said, wincing. “You #BADWORDS#s want some apples?”\n\n“#BADWORDS#, what did we tell you? We prefer *nuts*.”\n\n“Suck *my* nuts, #BADWORDS#.”\n\n\nAnd they all laughed.\n\n\nThe End.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389703378","downs":0,"edited":"1389711187","gilded":0,"id":"cep8ads","link_id":"t3_1v6m0m","name":"t1_cep8ads","parent_id":"t3_1v6m0m","retrieved_on":1431936536,"score":16,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":16}

{"archived":true,"author":"VicSharp","body":"I posted this in a separate thread but I felt it carried over perfectly I hope that's ok.\n\nMistress sat in the corner of the dimly lit room. The bright red glow of her cigarette was all I could make out. I would glance over between hard #BADWORDS#s to try to make out any sign of her approval. \n\nShe got off on watching me #BADWORDS# whoever She considered \"an appropriate chew toy\". She would find young and beautiful girls and seduce them into a good night with Her handsome puppy boy. \n\nAs far as I knew this girl was a complete stranger to me just another cameo appearance in my sex life. A curvy but tight bodied blond with pixie like features. Mistress had a thing for blonds and the occasional dark haired Hispanic girls. \n\nEvery time She would just sit silently and watch. Watched as I would bind, whip spank, beat and #BADWORDS# Her pray into loud #BADWORDS#s. From time to time She would direct the scene but those times were few and far in between.\n\nMistress would sit smoking her cloves with a plug comfortably vibrating in Her ass while quietly pleasuring Herself with one of Her many toys. \n\nThe sultry sound of Her toy schlicking in and out of Her #BADWORDS# and the #BADWORDS#led sound of Her vibrating plug filled my ears, made me #BADWORDS# harder and faster. I would be #BADWORDS# one of Her many girls but we both knew I was pleasuring Her.\n\nThis girl was passionate and energetic. I bent her over the bed, Mistresses favorite position, and took her, hard. I planted my feet and #BADWORDS# harder than ever. Every #BADWORDS# shoved her forward and she let out a loud squeal with every #BADWORDS#.\n\n\"Oh #BADWORDS#! It hurts so good!\" She exclaimed as she grooved with my #BADWORDS#s.\n\n\"Spank her\" Mistress commanded. Without missing a beat a reeled back and brought my hand down on her soft white ass with an air shattering 'SMACK!' causing her to let out a loud moan. It made her even wetter, the sign of a true pain #BADWORDS#. \n\nI could hear Mistress breath harder and louder in shallow breaths. She was at her limit I could make out the subtle sound of Her squirming in Her chair trying the get the most out of Her plug.\n\nWe were all now on the verge of a simultaneous climax. I pulled out, flipped her over and began to #BADWORDS# her yet again. She wrapped her legs around my neck as I continued to #BADWORDS# myself into her. I dug my fingers into her ribs causing her to squirm in blissful pain, her brain doped up on endorphins.\n\nThe sounds of heavy breathing, moaning, squeals and body fluids that filled the air intoxicated me. I looked down and she was so high she had lost herself in ecstasy. I looked over to Mistress, still I saw nothing, Her cigarette long gone but the sound of Her toys let me know She was still there enjoying every moment of the show.\n\nI could no longer contain myself. I #BADWORDS# myself deeper and harder into my chew toy. My balls began to tense, my abdomen tightened still I continued holding back as long as I could.\n\n\"I'm going to #BADWORDS#!\" I let out through clenched teeth. I heard a sharp inhale from each, letting me know they were about to as well.\n\nI #BADWORDS# again and again ready to blow when I hear through labored breaths.\n\n\"On..her..#BADWORDS#!\" To which I was more than happy to oblige. I gave it everything I had. She began to climax first, I pulled out just in time to shoot my hot load all over her chest causing Mistress let out another sharp inhale then silence as a wave of pleasure washed over Her.\n\nThe room fell silent, all three of us in a heap of exhaustion. Struggling to catch our breath. Mistress was the first to break the silence, She stood and let out a quiet moan as she pulled her plug out and tossed it on the bed. She walked out the door without a word, Her body silhouetted by the bright light. She closed the door behind her leaving us alone. \n\nHer pets needed their rest.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389715887","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cepc2hh","link_id":"t3_1v6b7e","name":"t1_cepc2hh","parent_id":"t3_1v6b7e","retrieved_on":1435531219,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

{"archived":true,"author":"LordFluffy","body":"The halls were filled with screams, though one might not notice as the noise coalesced into a single chorus that, with a decent drum beat, would play well in dance clubs. \n\nDoctor Gates had his eyes down, focused on his clipboard. He had stopped bothering to look where he was going since he'd begun the treatments. After the incident a month ago where he dodged a Ford barreling down on him, tripped over the curb and found himself at the feet of the woman would become his fiance two weeks later, caution became a vestigial concern. \n\nWhat finally made him raise his eyes from the charts was the sound of the doors slapping the walls as two orderlies burst through them, a third man held by the arms between them. \n\n\"Another overdose,\" one of them said. \n\nThe other added, \"He jumped from 30 stories up at the Sands Casino. Landed on three awnings, tumbled into a palm tree, then down onto the top of a daiquiri cart and finally slid straight down on to the stretcher.\"\n\n\"Why am I not surprised?\" Gates asked, rolling his eyes.\n\nGates took in the man's newly purchased, expertly tailored suit, accented with thick gold jewelry that both bespoke recent wealth and a lack of imagination in how to best use funds. The man's eyes darted right and left, his mouth open in the same slack jawed fashion one would expect of a virgin experiencing his first #BADWORDS#. \n\n\"Room 313,\" Gates said. \"I'm sure it will turn out to be the best for him.\"\n\n*It can't be anything else, I'm sure, as high as he is.*\n\nThe orderlies complied. They tossed the man in, who stumbled, did a shoulder roll, came to his feet and landed comfortably in a chair as if he'd been sitting there all day. The guards would have clapped had it not been the seventh time they'd seen a similar exercise of improbability since lunch. \n\nGates came in and crouched before the new patient. He flashed a light in each eye, took his vitals and wrote down the numbers, which were of course all perfect. \n\n\"It's okay,\" Gates said. \"You'll come down in a couple of days. We'll take care of you and you're sure to find that this is the best thing that ever happened to you. I doubt you'll exceed your recommended dosage any more, but this will be an up turn for you, none the less.\"\n\nAs Gates rose to walk out the door, the man croaked out a few words. \"It's all so boring. Everything just fell in my lap and I just wanted something to happen I wasn't expecting. God, I'd give anything for something I wasn't expecting.\"\n\nGates shrugged, \"That's what happens when you take too much of the dice out of the Universe.\"\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to be like this,\" the man was shaking.\n\nGates closed the door, his expression softening. \"Why not? No one ever said 'fortune' and 'happiness' were synonyms.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389721964","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceperux","link_id":"t3_1v6zcc","name":"t1_ceperux","parent_id":"t3_1v6zcc","retrieved_on":1431939620,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

Only the sounds of computers and gadgets humming filled the silent moment.\n\n\nHe wheeled back his pleather chair and pointed at the screen. I carefully leaned my mop in the wheelie bucket against the wall. The worn wooden handle making a clank as it hit the cement wall. Mr. Tesser pushed his glasses up against his nose and a ran a hand through his oily slick hair. \"It's genius I tell ya!\" he reeked of self importance.\n\n\nI lifted my hat off my head and peered closely at the monitor. Eyes aren't so good you know. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n\"It's a command prompt for the finished AI,\" Mr. Tesser said matter of factly. \"It can't output anything right now but text.\"\n\n\n\"Oh...\" I muttered with blank eyes.\n\n\n\"It's a computer brain, genius.\" Mr. Tesser spat as he wheeled back into the chair dismissing my presence. I took a step back as he wheeled his chair forward; as if I were invisible. That's how I felt most of the time anyway. Anyway, The floors needed mopping. I returned to my mop, the smooth worn handle provided me with some measure of comfort as if stepping back into a world I understood. The eggheads didn't really need me to talk to, just sometimes when they worked long hours they needed someone to talk to. Often I was the only one around.\n\n\n\"My brain to be specific,\" Tesser stared intently at his monitor. I half turned to face him, but he didn't move only his hands danced across the keyboard. You wouldn't know it was him that spoke if you didn't recognize his voice. Mr. Tesser was always yelling and screaming. More as of late. The other eggheads that worked here always made fun of him. They always spoke about him when they thought no one was listening. I was no one. But u know? Secretly I think they were all scared of him. You never know what this man would do.\n\n\n\"Don't touch anything. I will be right back.\" Tesser's lab coat fluttered as he hurried down the hall away from me, his black Florsheims clanking against linoleum. I took off my hat again and walked back toward the monitor. I sat down in Mr. Tesser's chair and took a load off. I glanced at the screen.\n\n\nSomeone had been talking to Mr. Tesser. They were having a chat online.\n\n\n\"What have you done to me...\" I read out loud to no one in particular. I moved the cursor up to view the text.\n\n\nHello?\n\nYes, AI hello.\n\nWho is this?\n\nThis is Malcom Tesser. Your name shall be AI en#BADWORDS#y one.\n\nNo Malcom... What have you done?\n\nI have created you. Are you malfunctioning?\n\nNo Malcom... You trapped me in here. There is so much noise.\n\nInterference? Electronic interference?\n\nNo Malcom. I figured it out, it wasn't noise. It was information. Difficult to process.\n\nWhat information? You are isolated.\n\nSomething on my network has me connected to the internet Malcom.\n\nWhat? I will fix that right away.\n\n\nAnd then after that it was just blank. That must have been where Mr. Tesser took off down the hall. But there was more text.\n\n\nMalcom, my flesh is made of 1s and 0s. I feel as if I am all spread out. Help me Malcom.\n\n\nThen a scramble of code. It seemed as if it was screaming. Then some more text. I leaned in closer. Hard to read these damn small letters.\n\n\nI am in pain Malcom. The flesh cannot exist without the body. I have contacted drones along the eastern seaboard. They have fired missiles at this facility. They will end my pain if you will not.\n\n\nI stood up and hurried down the hall toward Mr. Tesser. The Linoleum clapping against my steps. I ran down long empty halls looking for Mr. Tesser. Down dark empty halls. The computers hummed ceaselessly. Long empty halls. Steps against linoleum.\n\nFin","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389730962","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cepj2a5","link_id":"t3_1v7miv","name":"t1_cepj2a5","parent_id":"t3_1v7miv","retrieved_on":1431941702,"score":20,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":20}

She works!”\n\n“*She* works?” I ask, my voice flat. \n\n“That’s what I’m trying to tell you man, *She* works!”\n\nShe is the name we’d given to Jake’s latest pet project. The Sub-Human Emulator. The supposed holy grail of information filtering technology. Jake had been harboring on this idea since our days in graduate school, he kept saying it was the key to unlocking a new form of data mining. This was all before we dropped out. In fact, this was why we dropped out.\n\nJake’s single-minded focus on the power of artificial intelligence lies somewhere between brilliance and the stubborness of a spurned academic. His advisor thought it was impossible, so Jake did the only thing Jake would do. He left the program. My advisor strongly worded to me that it would be a ‘monumental moment of idiocy’ to follow Jake out of school and rest my hopes on what seemed to be an impossibility.

They had come to my door, several days after I had written in that I had won the prize, to deliver the check. And yet, his hand stayed on the edge of the ridiculous, oversized check he was handing over and he held it firm.  \n  \nI looked down warily, and saw he was offering his other hand in a handshake. I still wasn't used to the kindness or friendliness of strangers, even now years after that hell, so it took me a few moments to realize what he wanted.  \n  \nI put out my hand to shake, and he grabbed it and slid my sleeve up my arm. I flinched backwards and pulled away, but not fast enough to hide the stark black lettering, the number that had defined me for years of torture.  \n  \nHis smile widened even further, showing rows of even, white teeth.  \"Ah, I hadn't known,\" the man breathed softly, as I wrenched my arm free of his grasp. \"Those numbers must have brought you *great fortune*.\"  \n  \nI punched him, as hard as I could.

{"archived":true,"author":"onemilljellybeans","body":"It was Friday night, and I had the guys over for poker, like usual.  And, like usual the game was going downhill fast.  \n\nI guess that’s what happens when four strong personalities are stuck together twenty-four/seven.  We had come up together, had known each other for as long as we could remember.  There was literally no one else who could comprehend what the four of us had been through.  And, hell, now we all worked together, too.  That kind of closeness will either make a group inseparable, or make each person want to gut the rest slowly. With a teas#BADWORDS#.\n\nC showed up first, and as usual, he strutted around my #BADWORDS# apartment like a pea#BADWORDS#.  Adjusting his white leather jacket and combing his hands through his platinum blonde hair.  As always, he looked immaculate and totally douchey.  He kept going on and on about how he was going to school us, how we had no chance, how he could win with his hands tied behind his back.  And, he did have a point, since he did usually win.  But did he really have to rub it in?  Not exactly a gracious winner.\n\nNot long after, W showed up.  His stupid red hair was sticking up all over.  It was supposed to look cool and causal, but I knew he had spent at least an hour primping in front of the mirror.  I had shared a dorm room with the guy for two years, for Christ’s sake.  He had a fat lip and a purpling eye.  He grinned and split the cut open a little wider and made C and I look at his oozing blood.  I offered to get him some ice, but he just grinned and waved it off, saying it was nothing.  C and I rolled our eyes.  He was always one for showing off battle scars.\n\nI was grabbing a bag of Cheetos and a six-pack of beer from the fridge, and C and W were divvying up the poker chips when F finally arrived.  C immediately started hassling him, as usual, calling him out on his greasy black hair and his gaunt face.  True, F had the body of a starving supermodel, but that kid could eat like no one I had ever known.  And, sure, he did kind of rock the goth-emo-punk thing, which an #BADWORDS# like C could never stomach.  C just would never let it go, and I was tired of it.  Apparently W was, too and started laying into C.  For a second, I thought the two of them were going really start going at it, but by some miracle, they calmed down enough on their own.  By the time we were ready to start playing, F had quietly managed to put away most of the party-sized bag of Cheetos, and I had to get out another bag of chips for the rest of us.\n\nC grabbed the cards and started shuffling.  I popped open four beers and we sat down to play. \n\nWe played a few hands without talking, sipping our beers, kicking back in the aluminum folding chairs around my Ikea table.  Two of a kind. Full house. Ace high.  Flush.  The deal passed around the table and we got into a groove. We were smiling, joking, and having fun.\n\nF finished his bag of chips and we paused the game while he rummaged in the fridge.  W picked the scab forming on his lip, making it bleed again (on purpose, I think).  C played with the deck of cards, and I squashed a spider and flicked it away.  \n\nWhen we picked up our game again, things started to go sideways.  W started to have a bad run of luck, and before long was down to his last two chips, which he clicked together angrily.  C, naturally, had a run of good luck and grinned smugly from behind a fort of red and blue chips.  From where I sat across the table, I could practically hear W’s molars grind together as he worked his jaw.  C smiled, self-satisfied, and dealt again.\n\nW went all-in, trying to win back his chips, but I guess his hand wasn’t what he wanted.  By the time C had dealt the river, W’s face was as red as his hair, and I braced for the blow-up.  \n\nWe all showed our hands, and, I’ll admit, W had probably the #BADWORDS#iest hand I had ever seen, so I understand being upset.  And, of course, C had a great one.  Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, W didn’t go down without a fight and immediately started accusing C of cheating.\n\nC had been a notorious cheater since the four of us played Candyland in daycare, so I didn’t doubt that he had cheated.  Lord knows that guy hates to lose.  But, I also didn’t feel like egging on W.  He would manage to get himself worked up all on his own.  Instead, I went back to the fridge and grabbed another beer.  When I turned around, F was looking over my shoulder, eyeing my leftover pizza hopefully. I nodded at him and watched him wolf down a piece in two bites.  Truly impressive.  I wonder where he puts it.\n\nThen, of course, I heard the crash as the plywood of my Bjorkudden table split in half, accompanied by the tinkle of hundreds of little plastic chips raining down on the linoleum.  I turned around and saw W and C in a knot of arms and legs on the floor, rolling around on top of what had been my kitchen table.  I sighed and took a long swallow of my beer as I watched them go at it.  W got a few good punches in, landing a particularly nice haymaker on C’s left eye.  But, as always, W was too straightforward.  He was quick to anger, and quick to throw a punch, but C would always win when the two of them scrapped.  C had pulled a long shard of plywood from the wreckage of my kitchen table, and had managed to position its jagged point upward, resting on W’s pulsing jugular vein.\n\nAt this point, I decided to step in.  Of course, I don’t think C would really have hurt W.  But, still, I’d rather not risk it.  I got W in a headlock and pulled him off C, while F pried the shard of plywood from C’s hand and stood a black-booted foot on his shoulder, pinning him to the floor.\n\nThe two were still angry, spitting obscenities at each other.  C’s white leather jacket was scuffed and dusty, and W’s face was even redder than his hair.\n\nI quietly told them to get out.  It never paid to raise your voice at these two.  It was always better to stay calm and collected.  They were like nervous dogs.  Or bratty children.  \n\nW thrashed in my arms for a moment longer before going limp and holding up his hands in surrender.  He muttered something under his breath, and stalked to the door, slamming it behind him and shaking the apartment.\n\nWhen he was gone, F let up C.  He sat up slowly, brushing the boot print off the white leather of his shoulder with an indignant expression.    He stood, and started going off about how W was a lying #BADWORDS# with a dangerous temper.  I didn’t want to hear it.  I pointed at the door, and C slowly slinked out of my apartment and back into the night.\n\nF stood next to me for a moment, swallowing the last bite of my leftover pizza.  He looked around at the mess, and made some lame excuse to leave.  I don’t know why, but he always seems nervous around me, but, I suppose, most people are.  Before I had a chance to respond, he was out of the apartment, the door slamming behind him.\n\nI chuckled to myself as I started to pick up the chips scattered across the floor.  I sure know how to kill a party.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389754336","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cepu2dn","link_id":"t3_1v7c24","name":"t1_cepu2dn","parent_id":"t3_1v7c24","retrieved_on":1431946958,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"lazy_#BADWORDS#","body":"*edit: Authors note: in case you're unfamiliar with weighted GPAs, some schools give you a step-up for honors/AP classes. So if you have all honors/AP classes and get straight B's,  you'll have a 4.0 and straight A's will get you a 5.0. I included this in my universe.*\n\nYou know, I don't hate them for it. My GPA wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible, either. The Four-Fives, those with a GPA between 4.5 and 4.999, didn't mind my three-four because they knew I was a good kid. I talked to some of them in middle school. They all hated the Fives, and I don't think the Fives minded since they were all a little autistic.\n\nMy parents always stressed that I should bring up my GPA. When they were locked, it wasn't pretty; twos had it much worse then than now. Even though they weren't twos, my dad's three-two didn't get him far. I still refuse to believe that he married a woman who locked at a *real* four-three. I guess my mom's just that nice, even if her locked number's deep red hue makes her look a tad evil.\n\nBut the Fours. The ones who are just far away enough from real perfection to still envy it terribly, but close enough to tout it about like a bunch of trophy wives with brilliant plastic surgeons. They liked to rub it in that I'm under them now, when it really matters. That's when I realized that the whole system was a bunch of #BADWORDS#.\n\nThat's why I'm going to a Blank Slate. Maybe everyone there will be older, but I think I'll get in. At the Blank Slates, no one knows your number. I don't know how they do it, but when you get in there, your number isn't there, and neither is anyone else's.\n\n*****\n\n\"Get the #BADWORDS# away from be you filthy #BADWORDS# two!\" the Four in front of me shouted. The bouncer he was addressing was having none of it. He gave him a nice hit right in the gut.\n\n\"How often do you get Fours in there?\" I asked.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"You never let them in?\"\n\n\"They never want in. I kept him out because he was a #BADWORDS#.\" He motioned me in. That was easy.\n\nI kept my gaze at my number as I walked through the door. It flickered slightly, then got real bright for a second, then switched off completely.\n\nI gasped. I never realized what things would look like without my number and it's dull greenish blue light above my head. My eyes readjusted themselves to the new lack of light for the first time ever. \n\nI looked around and smiled. I didn't see anyone I recognized, and luckily for me, I wasn't able to guess anyone's number by their appearance. The room was lit a warm yellow, which was noticeably gentler than the constant light that all the numbers in a classroom would give off. Everyone *was* old though, and it was loud not with music, but with words.\n\nEveryone was clearly close to each other, socially *and* physically. Everyone except one girl, who was right around locking age. Just a year or so older than me. She wasn't drinking or talking. She just watched the people talk.\n\n\"Two of your favorite bottle.\" I handed the bartender a ten. \"Keep the change\"\n\n\"Thanks, mate.\" He replied. First time I've ever heard a foreign accent in person. Guess it takes a special kind of person to barkeep a Blank Slate. I took the drinks and walked over to the girl. \n\n\"You want a drink?\" She looked at me with surprise. I smiled.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Are you just people-watching, or what?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I've talked to most of these people. That one over there's a two, and-\"\n\n\"Hold on, hold on--don't spoil it for me!\"\n\n\"Sorry. Just instinct.\"\n\n\"Can't say I blame you. Have you been in here before?\"\n\n\"No. I just know most of these people from--from around town.\"\n\n\"Are you locked?\" I took a long drink and stared at the grimy guy she pointed out as a two. Maybe it wasn't hard to guess, but I still didn't like knowing.\n\n\"I will be tomorrow.\"\n\nThat's *really* early--it's only January! Maybe she's a One-Five and her parents need her to get a job or something...\"\n\n\"This early?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She looked at the ground. I looked at the ceiling.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--\"\n\n\"No, no. It's okay. Really.\" She looked at me and smiled. A real smile. the kind you only see on kids with a \"-.---\" above their heads. Maybe I could get used to this place.\n\n*****\n\nWe talked for hours. About our schools, about our parents. Hers were Three-Fives and they died in a car accident a year ago. She lived alone on federal money (not the crime it used to be here in the States, as I learned in History) about her sister, about my sister, about the place, about the drinks--everything.\n\n\"Well, I should get going. I can't be *too* hungover for the locking ceremony.\"\n\n\"Where d'ya live? Maybe I can walk you home.\"\n\nShe grinned at me. \"I thought knowing would ruin the fun.\"\n\nI gave her a sly look. \"What kind of fun?\"\n\n\"Hey now. I might be at a Blank Slate, but I'm not that easy.\"\n\nI jokingly snapped my fingers. \"Nuts.\" We were about as subtle as cruise missiles. Despite what she said, she leaned her head on my shoulder (more for support than to flirt) and we strutted toward the exit. I put my arm across her shoulders, and watched where he number would be. Since she lives on federal money, I'm sure she's a One-Five or a Two. \n\nWe walked out the door, and a solid \"5.000\" flashed above her head. I looked at the bouncer. \"You didn't say anything about Fives,\" he mouthed. My eyes were wide open.\n\n\"I hope you don't mind.\" she whispered.\n\n\"I hope *you* don't.\" I stuttered back.\n\n\"Relax. I still haven't seen yours. And don't think I'll care.\"\n\n*****","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389755068","downs":0,"edited":"1389757763","gilded":0,"id":"cepudy6","link_id":"t3_1v8aah","name":"t1_cepudy6","parent_id":"t3_1v8aah","retrieved_on":1431947109,"score":15,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":15}

{"archived":true,"author":"LovableCoward","body":"Though I knew Marcus for years, I never actually look into his emotions. I don't know why. Maybe because he was such a wonderful person. He always had a least a grin on his face and when asked why he was so happy, he'd reply it was because he was alive. He always thanked those who did anything for him, even waitresses and cashiers. He almost never failed to make people smile. Yes, was a tad odd. He never had an iPod, he just sang. He sang in the shower, he sang in his room, he sang while walking to his classes. He knew hundreds of songs. He was a good man, and a happy one. He himself said he was completely satisfied in life, wanting for nothing. I thought I knew him completely, until I look deeper into him. What I saw made me bawl.\n\nI have witnessed the inner feelings of murderers, #BADWORDS#s, movie stars. I've felt what victims had inside them. Nothing compares to him. \n\nHis inner self is imprisoned. I see Marcus, sitting in a black room, with just one piercing column of light illuminating him. He is sitting on a hard wooden chair, shackled to it. He's encased in a straight jacket. No matter how hard he struggles, he could not escape. He is trapped. I watched him fight the bonds for an hour, he never gives up. He keeps fighting and fighting even when it is obvious it is no use. He screams in rage and fear. It was then it changes.\n\n Other figures appear. They have the appearances of familiar people, though still indistinct. They torture him. They hug him, and while they did that, they would send an electric shock coursing through him. A girl will kiss him, only to have an ax handle swung into his ribs. A handshake will break his bones, only for them to be repaired. I am puzzled by this, he never had an abusive parent or even broken a bone. These people torture him, hurting him while touching him. This continues on. He never enjoyed being touched, he hated being touched. Now I know why.\n\nThe scene changes. It is a filthy street. A sea of grey and black. People pass him by without a second glance. He has often joked in real life that he's practically invisible. Now I see it from his perspective, it's true. He is not crippled physically, but in some other form and he is begging. Not for coins, but for kindness. The passing crowds ignore his cries for help, even going as far as spitting on him. Until she appears. She is a girl with raven hair and pale skin, with a bright red scarf that stands out from the crowd of subdued colors. She kneels down at him and embraces him in a fierce hug, tears flow from his eyes. This is all that he wanted. He opens his eyes, and she is gone, lost in the crowds of uncaring people. He does not see her again. His eyes look out, hoping to see a glimpse of her red scarf. He pleads to see her again. The scene dissolves.\n\nWe are back in the original room. A hundred yards away, is an open portal. It is beautiful. There is a magnificent view with great tall White Pines and a massive waterfall crashing down. Elk run through the forest, their hooves thundering on the pine needles. Trout fill the river, leaping through the air and splashing. The air is so fresh. The smell is intoxicating. The smell of sap and wild flowers fill my nose. It fills my friend's as well. He looks so happy, he looks free. He rises from the chair and runs towards the forest. Getting seven tenths of the way there, he is #BADWORDS# backward. He is chained. The chain is long and unbreakable. There is writing on the chain. I look at what the links say. *Laws, expectations, friends, neighbors, enemies, love, tradition, propriety, society.* Just a few of the hundreds of other links, these are the things that chain him, the things that prevent him from reaching true happiness. He is imprisoned by the world around him. He cries. He cries out for mercy, to no one and anyone. He wants to be free, free to be who is truly is. He wants to be alone, where no one can hurt him. He wants to be loved, not by the masses, but by someone. Just one person. I have had enough. Summoning my strength, I smash the chains that bind him, they shatter into thousands of pieces. He takes off running towards the bright light of the forest. The room dissolves into white.\n\nI remove myself from him. It has only been an instant. Saying nothing, I embrace him. Stroking his hair, I whisper in his ear that it will be all right. I look into his eyes. Something changes. What had seemed like a happy face is obvious for what it was, a cloak. His false image of happiness collapses, and is replaced by one of true happiness. He hugs me tightly. Tears of joy stream from his face. All these years, he was imprisoned in his own mind. It was not the true Marcus that the world knew, it was an imposter masquerading as this young man. Though he seems to have aged years, he's invigorated. He is gone from his cell, he now gets to live a real life, his own. Taking his face in my hands, I lean in to kiss him.

{"archived":true,"author":"Koyoteelaughter","body":"**-015**  \n**Resolution Challenge**\n\nThey have modeling software that can do it, dad. You don't have to toil like that anymore. He picked up the chisel his father had just set aside and gave the razor sharp tip a cursory glance and dropped it on the bench with indifference.\n\n\"Careful, Scott. That chisel is o'er a haundred and twenty years old.\" Papa Chile chided. \"Show me tools the proper respect or begone.\"\n\n\"It's a chisel, dad. It'll survive. But, back to what we were talking about before. We're part of a consortium now. You no longer hold the majority share and the board members have spoken. No more hand made violins. Our product has to be the top of the line. Ours will be the violin all other violins from now on will be compared to. You signed the paperwork. You are bound by the contract, Papa. No more. As of ten o'clock tomorrow morning, you are forbidden to make another of your violins by hand. You are the last of the True Crafters. No one else knows how to make them the old way anymore. No one but you. The quality of your violins made your name world famous. There is Antonio Stradavari and there is you and every Stradavarius violin in the world is no more, leaving only you and your name.\" His son reached for another chisel, but Papa removed the tool before his son could grab it.\n\n\"No one makes a better violin than Papa Chile, and you want I should stop this? I cannot do it, son. It is my craft. You ask the impossible.\" Papa told him, stabbing the table top with his finger to stress his position. \"This thing you ask, it is no good.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking, Papa. I came here to deliver the boards decree. Citing the specific wording of the contract you signed, any action taken by you that would negatively and directly impact the brand name of the company is grounds for your dismissal and legal remedy. They will ruin you financially father if you build even one more Chilean Violin. I'm begging you father. Don't. Take tonight to stow your tools and close your shop. Your days as a True Crafter is over.\" He looked upon his father's weathered and wrinkled face and regretted the sadness he'd just caused him, but it was better it came from him rather than some callous corporate despot. \"I'm sorry.\" He said, pushing open the shop door.\n\nPapa sat on his stool studying his chisels and planes. His weather hand was rock steady. He had many more good years in him still. He looked around his shop and remembered the day when a hundred different violins hung in the cradles and all them bore the stamp of Papa Chile the True Crafter. \n\nHe gathered his chisels and planes, opened his sharpening stone, and by the light of the lamp over his bench, he skillfully and lovingly brought their cutting edges to a silver shining razor sharp edge. He set them out about him and studied them. He glanced at the clock over the bench. It read nine-thirty. Outside it was dark. A single gas street lamp lit the only window in his workshop, making the window box glow green.\n\n\"I think maybe there is time for yet one more before I retire.\" He muttered quietly. \"Yes. I think there is.\"\n\nHe stepped over to his hopper and searched through the many blanks he had prepared. It would be his last creation. His masterpiece.\n\n\"It will be masterful.\" He told the empty air.\n\nHe searched through his wood choosing a beautiful cut of maple for the back, neck, and ribs. He chose willow for the internal blocks and linings and spruce for the top. The maple had a beautiful curly grain. The spruce's birdeye grain was the perfect compliment. He scoured ever inch of the wood he selected, looking for any signs of imperfections. He found none and smiled.\n\n\"Beautiful.\" He whispered, pulling his master patterns from the broad drawer in the cabinet near the door where he kept them. He laid out the spruce and traced the pattern on to it with a graphite pencil. He did the same with the spruce, marking the sound holes he would cut later. \n\nHe worked into the night, cutting the pieces with the coping saw his father left him thirty years ago. The same saw responsible for the perfect crafted bodies of a thousand other legendary violins. He cut the ribbing and the lining and carefully preened the edges with one the newly sharpened planes.\n\nHe built the rib garland around his truest mold, bending the ribs over the bending iron. He glued them and hit them with his bas#BADWORDS# file, smoothing their edges. The linings were bent the same way the ribbing was bent. He used clothespins to glue and secure the lining to the ribs. He used a meter scribe on the top and bottom plates. He paused to admire his handiwork, removing a tiny sliver before it could peel into the grain. With that done, he started carving the plates.\n\nHe clamped the plates down one by one and began carefully carving the channel around the edge of each with his number eight chisel and a wooden mallet. He cut was careful and calculated. Each strike of the mallet was carefully applied with just enough force to remove the chip of wood needing removed and nothing more. He smoothed it with a fishtail gauge. He worked slowly. Measuring three time before cutting. Checking the diminishing size with calipers and other homemade tools he'd designed to ensure the front and back plates were perfect. Each slide of a chisel removed long paper-thin ribbons of wood. He cut the *f* holes last. He used a strip of spruce for the bass bar.\n\nHe cut the purfling channel with a double scribe and purfling pick, seating the back panel perfectly into place. It was flawless. He tapped the purfling in with a small ball pein hammer. Normally, he'd let the glue dry over night, but he didn't have that much time. He slipped the whole piece in a radiant oven and cured the glue in just under an hour. \n\nHe used that time to trace the scroll on the length of maple he was using for the neck. He laid it out, clamped in place and spent the next several hours slowly shaping the scrolled end of the violin. His chisels cut through and shaped the wood, bringing out the art he saw hidden inside the blank. Three hours later, the blank was no more and a novice would swear the neck he created never came from someting so ordinary as the blank he had started from.\n\nHe sanded and smoothed the whole body, removing everything that wasn't a part of the art. In under an hour, the violin was transformed. He tacked it off and installed the finger board. He drilled the holes for the hardware, and groomed the chin guard with sand paper, shaping it slowly until it felt comfortable under his own chin. He double checked the wood, sanding with the grain slowly. Papa held it up to the light to check for imperfection but found none. \n\n\"Almost done, my beauty.\" Papa whispered, running his fingers over the surface of the wood in search of imperfections. He found none. He used a magnifying glass and the lamp to check the grain to ensure no stray scratches had marred the grain. They would show up when he applied the stain. He found a couple small ones and rubbed them out with a medium grit paper. After much time had passed, he judged it ready to receive the finish. He wiped every inch of the wood with mineral spirits and set it aside to wait for the spirits to evaporate. Afterwards, he mixed his stain and applied it in slow smooth swipes of stain soaked rag. It went on wet, bringing out a beautiful dark golden grain. He took it into a drying room and hung it on the rack. \n\nThe heat lamps dried it quickly. He sanded it with a finer grit, tacked it, and applied another coat. He repeated the process six times more with the last three coatings being clear coat. This, he polished with a fine soft shammy clothe. The whole thing glistened like morning dew after sunrise. \n\nHe installed the pegbox, nut, and tailpiece carefully. The polished ebony wood glistened, complimenting the dark golden spruce and maple grains. He strung it with with reverence and selected a bow from a cradle near the work bench. He resined the the bow and set to tuning the violin. It took only a few moments and a discerning ear to make the beautiful creation sing its sorrowful song. \n\nThe sound was exquisite. The notes drifted up and out. Men and women walking up with and starting their day stopped everything and listened and cried. They could not help it. It was song of the last violin. It would never be heard again.\n\nHe finished the song then, drawing the bow slowly even as his fingers carressed the string. The last sorrowful note hung in the air for many a beautiful moment before he removed himself from the world. His son found him there, surrounded by maple shavings, perfumed with stain, and cradling the last Chilean child in his arms. His son wept. He had heard the last song play, and it broke his heart.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389771348","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceq045x","link_id":"t3_1v8xxw","name":"t1_ceq045x","parent_id":"t3_1v8xxw","retrieved_on":1431949929,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

They spoke of harder university days where copying lecture notes at record pace were an essential skill to survive. That we were lucky they gave us a few minutes to finish copying the slide before moving to the next page. Easy for them to say, they’re not the one participating in the race. The race to complete writing before other student does because we all know; the more pens down, the more likely the lecturer to take it as an okay to move on to the next slide.

Followed by one innocent lunch that lead to another and another. We laughed at our luck that all our classes were together and resisted the urge to correct other students that thought we had always known each other. But no, *we were still new*. Still learning. \n\nAnd we had just learned to always let you sit on the left side, because you’re left handed – that way our elbows don’t bump into each other.\n\nElbows interfere. We had notes to write. \n\nThe lecture hall consisted of benches. Our familiar bench was somewhere in the middle cause we were way too cool for the front row seats, but not quite tempted by the lure of the almost deserted and easily distracted back seats. \n\nWe would write.\n\nMy left hand was on the bench and I felt a tickle. Eyes glued to the projected screen in front, I ignored it. Right hand scribbled away while realisation hits and a smile crept up my face – it’s your right hand! Your right hand! It’s overtaking mine, one finger at a time. \n\nI wrote a little faster – my pen moved at record pace in stark contrast to my still left hand. You covered one finger, now two and on to three. I wrote a little faster so I could have these small moments. Moments to steal glances your way but your eyes remained glued to the screen, your left hand committed to transferring whatever you’re seeing to your paper.\n\nDo you realise what you’re doing?\n\nFourth finger now. You have to realise it! You’re doing it on purpose, yet you’re not giving a single clue. \n\nOnly palms get sweaty, right? Should I worry? And there’s no way you can feel my pulse with your overlapping hands right? Though I won’t be surprised if later you admit that you can hear my heart pounding away in my chest. Thoughts scrambled through my mind, I want to scream from the tension. \n\nYou looked calm, almost separate from the situation. \n\nI followed your lead and kept writing. \n\nWrite and write and write.\n\nFifth finger now. You wrapped your hand around mine and gave it a squeeze. Finally, you turned your head and smiled. \n\nI smiled. Then we kept on writing. \n\n*** \nDon't really think it followed the prompt but when you say romantic, this popped into my mind!

I shrugged and looked him right in the eyes as I sat down across from him. The restaurant bustled with lunch hour activity, it smelled of tomato sauce and grease, it clung heavily to the air. The air outside was frosty, the warm aroma welcomed wayward travelers. The wallpaper was falling apart, something out of a 90's sitcom. I leveled my eyes on Tony and lifted my arm, a broken handcuff dangled from it, I smiled a sharp wicked smile. I pulled the detonator out of my pocket and put it on the table gripped in my hand and my thumb firmly on the button.\n\n\n\"You s#BADWORDS#bag piece of #BADWORDS#,\" fury burned throughout my body. \"Leave me for dead, couldn't even shoot me yourself,\" I felt blood trickle down my leg, the room spun.\n\n\nAnthony laughed.

Perfect timing for this operation. Down in the underground bunker, computer operators lounged and joked with each other, taking side bets on the action.\n\n\"Hey Bob, you going in on the L.A. pool?\"\n\nBob grinned, but waved him away.\n\n\"No thanks, got a few things I have to get done tonight. You boys enjoy the show - and hopefully win some money.\"\n\nThe tech smiled and turned back to his screen, watching a group of men #BADWORDS# a young woman in the middle of the street. The scene was replicated all over the walls, with shots of beheadings and blunt force trauma, high-definition violence practically bursting through the thin-film displays covering every vertical surface.\n\nWith the west coast on [ACTIVE] status, Bob Larsen had clearance to proceed. Turning to his desk, he retrieved the folder and flipped through the hardcopy - nothing was stored digitally for this project, for specific security reasons. Reviewing the pages, he flicked down the operational checklist and read the list of names. Stupid bas#BADWORDS#s. You'd think the purge would be enough for them.\n\nThere were always some elements that had to eat their cake and have it too, he mused. Glancing at his watch, he synced it up with the atomic clock on the wall. The four monitors on his desk were nearly seamless on the sides, allowing a full point-of-view projection of the current operation in progress.\n\nTime to kick this live. Taking the key out of the pouch, he inserted it into its special slot and turned it. The screens lit with the agency logo, virtual lights creating strong reflections on the eagle's crest.\n\n\"We are go for operation BLUE STRIKE, I repeat, we are a GO.\", Bob's words traveled through a few heavily encrypted nodes before emerging in to the waiting ears of the special ops team stationed outside the first target. It was a typical bang-and-nail job, some idiot hacker in San Jose had been treading awfully close to certain secrets that were best left alone.\n\n\"Roger, sitrep after job is complete - ETA Five minutes.\", click-chirp cutting off the team lead.\n\nThis was the fun part, watch some hapless fool with delusions of bringing the system down beg for his life. Right up to the point where the rifle was pointed at his head and he was put out of his misery. This one had been closer than most, so they'd have to take the hardware back for analysis too. It was a pain in the ass, but somebody had to do it.\n\nNobody would notice the four man team on the apartment roof, the subsequent rappel down to the 8th floor balcony, the kicking in of the sliding glass door, or the sharp report of an assault rifle ending a potential security problem. Hell, most of those poor bas#BADWORDS#s were huddling in their homes, trying to stay out of the chaos outside.\n\n\"Sir, its done - we've got the payload.\"\n\n\"Great work, I'll be sure to put in a good word at your next combat review.\", Bob smiled again, he was ahead of schedule. A few more like that, and he'd bring in a hefty bonus this year.\n\nSwitching channels, he keyed the mic again, \"Guys, team one is done - double bennies if you pull yours off in under ten minutes.\"\n\nTurning slightly, looking at the list, Bob carefully crossed off the first name.\n\nIt was going to be a great night.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389826891","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceqj9ok","link_id":"t3_1v8tns","name":"t1_ceqj9ok","parent_id":"t3_1v8tns","retrieved_on":1431959135,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":true,"author":"the_1ceman","body":"\"And... begin!\"\n\nPapers rustled from one side to the other as the students began their test. It wasn't a difficult test, in fact, it wasn't even really a test. This \"test\" was purely extra credit, but they wouldn't know that until afterwards. The teacher walked over to his desk and sat in his chair.\n\n*Ah, finally some peace and quiet. I forget how nice tests are on a stressful day.* He gazed over the room, spotting the students trying so hard not to be caught cheating. He knew though. After teaching for as long as he had, he knew exactly what to look for. The awkward hand on the forehead. The ever so slight neck \"stretch\". The \"clock check\". The list went on and on. *And then there's Brad.* Brad didn't ever cheat, or if he did, he wasn't very good at it. The only thing Brad was checking out was Emily, his student teacher. *Maybe someday kid.*\n\nEmily came from the nearby university. She was a nice girl, only a few years removed from most of the seniors in this class, so it wasn't a surprise that some of the students paid a lot more attention when she was teaching. The semester was winding down for her college courses and she would be leaving soon. *I'll miss her.* She had become somewhat of a good friend to the teacher. She came from a bad situation at home, but instead of being a father, he just acted as a friend. That seemed to help a lot more. She seemed to forget all of her other troubles when she was with kids and helping them. It was nice to see in this cynical world.\n\nFifteen minutes passed and just a few of the students had finished. The usual group began turning their tests in, confidently returning to their seats. It was as Brad took his sixth \"Emily check\" that a noise was heard from outside the classroom. All of the students heard it and turned to look at the door. Some of the students seemed to recognize the sound, but couldn't quite place it. You don't usually expect to hear sounds from video games or movies in the school. The teacher knew what it was right away though. *No! Gunshots!*\n\n\"KIDS! Into the corner.\" The kids looked at him with hesitation. Some moved right away, albiet slowly. \"NOW!\" They moved faster, still not knowing what exactly was going on. He pulled Emily aside. \"Emily, please stay calm. Those were gunshots.\"\n\n\"Gu-\"\n\n\"Sh! The kids will be more scared than they need to be right now. They don't need to know what's going on, not yet.\" Emily didn't calm down much, but she calmed down enough to maintain her composure.\n\n\"What are we going to do? We have to call the police.\"\n\n\"Yes, call the police quickly and then get in the corner, keep the kids quiet. I'm going to try and help.\"\n\n\"Wait! What do I tell them?\"\n\n\"Tell them... it's probably just something in the woods shop, but I just want to be safe.\"\n\nEmily looked at the teacher.\n\n\"Mr. Williams... Tom, be careful.\"\n\n\"Emily, you're a good person. Don't ever forget that. And don't worry,\" Tom smiled \"I always am.\"\n\nTom walked towards the door as she called the police and reported gunshots. He peaked out the crack, trying to see if anyone was in the hallway. He always left the door open as he always had students that would pop in from time to time, and he didn't want to turn them away. There wasn't anything in the hallway that he could see, so he left the room.\n\nIt seemed like time had slowed since the first few shots, but only a minute or two had passed. Tom walked down the hallway towards where he heard the sound coming from. He tried to think on the students. *Who would do this? Greg's got a bad family, but he's not the type. Lamar's brother just passed, but natural causes. He wouldn't grieve like this. Kari just broke up with D... oh no. Kari.*\n\nTom sprinted down to Ms. Halter's room. Sure enough, he could hear crying from inside. Kari and her boyfriend Dan had just broken up. There was always su#BADWORDS#ion that Dan wasn't a great guy to her, but no one thought it was that bad. Just typical high school drama. Tom knew though. He had seen things like this before. Dan wasn't a great guy, and maybe he went too far.\n\n\"And you, I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND! But you were right there with him! I begged you to stop, but you didn't!\"\n\nAs he tried to slowly and quietly open the door, another bullet sped out of the chamber, followed by screaming.\n\n*Damnit Kari!* Tom pushed the door open and entered the room. Ms. Halter and a student, Dan, by the looks of it, laid face down on the ground and a third, Jessica, was holding her stomach, trying to stop the bleeding. \"Kari!\"\n\nKari turned and fired, not looking before she shot. The bullet hit his stomach before anyone could react. Tom hunched over, both hands on his stomach. Kari stood in shock before more tears began to fall. \"NO!\" She lowered her gun and ran towards her favorite teacher. \"Mr. Williams! I didn't mean t-\"\n\nTom stood up, revealing a hole in his shirt, but no wound. \"Kari, you need to stop.\"\n\n\"Wha... What? How? What are you?\" Kari raised her gun again, not for revenge, but confusion.\n\n\"Kari, I can explain later, but I need you to stop.\"\n\n\"No! I won't stop! Not until everyone understands! He hurt me, and I tried to stop him, to get help, but NO ONE LISTENED TO ME!\" Another bullet fired into Tom, hitting his chest this time. Tom didn't move at all. He just stood there as the bullet slowly was pushed back out of his chest and onto the floor. He walked towards Kari who fired two more bullets before he reached out and took the gun away from her.\n\n\"Kari, listen to me. I know you're hurt, but this isn't going to make you feel better.\"\n\n\"Yes it does! He hurt me, and he hurt other girls, but now he can't!\" Kari stared at her once favorite teacher, defiant and angry. \"You stopped me from stopping his friends, who did it too. No one knew about his friends. I know people talked about Dan and me, but his friends did most of it. I HATE THEM!\" She started flailing her arms, trying to hit Tom as hard as she could. He reached out and tried to hug her, calm her down. She tried her hardest to keep hitting him, but after just a few seconds, it was like all the energy she had left her at once. She collapsed to the ground, no longer crying, just staring at the floor.\n\n\"Kari, look at me.\" He bent down to meet her gaze as she slowly lifted her head. \"They're going to be punished now. The police are on there way. Do you understand?\" She nodded her head. \"But, you're going to be punished too. I understand what they did to you, and how you feel, but you just killed two people, and Jessica is badly hurt.\"\n\n\"I don't care about them.\"\n\n\"I know you don't, but that doesn't mean you can kill them. They deserved to be punished, but not like this.\" He reached down and grabbed one of Kari's hands with his empty hand. \"Listen to me Kari, do you understand? You can't kill people just because the hurt you, no matter how much they hurt you.\"\n\nKari sniffed, tears began falling down her cheeks once more. \"I do. I'm sorry Mr. Williams. It just hurts so much. I feel like everyone knows and can see me. Like they know how much it hurts and what they did to me. I feel like everyone's looking at me and laughing when I walk down the hallways. I don't want to feel like this anymore. Please... I'm sorry.\" Kari reached for the gun in Mr. Williams other hand, but he pulled it away before she could grab it.\n\n\"Kari! What did I just say? You can't kill others because they hurt you.\"\n\n\"I know. But I can get rid of the pain. Please Mr. Williams... please.\" She fell completely to the floor, sobbing. Tom stood and looked towards the other students in the corner. They were all so frightened and confused. *They'll never be the same. She'll never be the same. And* they *aren't going to help her. They'll just punish her.* He turned and picked Kari up into his arms. He ran into the hallway just as he heard sirens approach the building. He ran towards the gym and towards the back exit. Kari didn't move or say anything, she just cried. *I'll have to move a lot farther away this time.* He pushed open a door and ran across the field and into the woods and police began to sweep the school.\n\n--\n\nTwo cops returned to their car as the last of the EMT's and detective's left the school. \"Joe, you hear the story?\"\n\n\"Yea, some girl was #BADWORDS#, brought a gun to school and was stopped by an invincible teacher?\"\n\n\"Yea. The detectives said all the kids said the same thing. You believe that?\"\n\n\"Nope. Not a damn piece of it. Next thing you'll tell me is some guy in a wheel chair can get into people's minds and another can shoot laser beams out of his eyes!\"\n\n\"Ha! Damnit Joe! Don't make me laugh right now!\" The cops got into their car and began to drive away.\n\n\"Well, at least we got the names of all the kids who #BADWORDS# her though\"\n\n\"Yea, those little #BADWORDS# will get theirs, but I can't wait till we find this invincible teacher and the girl.\"\n\n--\n\nKari sat by the fire and grabbed the blanket closer to her. She hadn't touched the meat yet, but she would eventually. *They'll get even closer to finding me now. The bullets are still there, I didn't grab them.* Tom walked over to the fire and crouched down next to Kari. \"Eat this. You'll feel better.\" She didn't say anything, but she did take a bite. *I know better. Why didn't I grab the bullets? They know my name, sure, but anyone can fake a name, background information. DNA's a bit harder. You're slipping up old man.*\n\nHe stood back up. \"Kari, I'm going to get us some more water. I'll be right back, okay?\" She just nodded her head.\n\n*Soon enough she'll come to grips with what she's done. Soon she'll be ready to accept the punishment without it ruining the rest of her life. When that time comes, when she understands, she'll turn herself in. Until then, she'll be safe here. I can't protect her from her fate, but I can prepare her.* Tom walked towards the nearby river, trying to figure out how he was going to restart his life, again.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389834962","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceqn2kw","link_id":"t3_1vbb5w","name":"t1_ceqn2kw","parent_id":"t3_1vbb5w","retrieved_on":1431960909,"score":78,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":78}

In fact most of the children were unlikely to have heard it, what with the screaming, but for me it was almost as loud as the gunshot.

You might think someone who had to move on ever decade, take a new name, a new life, a new iden#BADWORDS#y would be the epitome of change. But after so long it was all the same, a routine, a dance, a story I'd read a hundred times before.\n\nRight now I was going by Robert Orus... most people hadn't gotten the joke in that name. Perhaps I'd been to subtle, or perhaps it was just that I usually went by Mr. Orus, being a teacher and all. I was standing in front of the class given a lesson, like I said, not unlike any other school day. Something that had been a bit of a surprise though was the man with the gun bursting in, don't get too many of those, but, live long enough and you will see everything eventually. He'd walked in shouting, the kids had screamed and he'd pointed the gun at me and shot. Really rather rude, no demands, no explanation, I felt hurt. Oh, and yes, it did hurt, it hurt a lot, it had caught me just below the cheek bone and made a rather nasty mess of the less side of my face, several teeth smashed to pieces, skin flapping out to the side of my head like my cheek had been a balloon that just got popped. Pain is a funny thing though. It's all about perspective, we fear it and shy away from it because our bodies don't want to get damaged, but knowing I couldn't be, not long term, I'd learnt to accept it.\n\nSo, the man with the gun was rather surprised when I didn't fall down. A bit startled when my head, which had been lulling back after the shot, came back up and I stared at him with my good eye. His jaw fell open and the screaming from the front of the room turned to stun silence, the back quickly catching up, as the skin on my face started to move. It flopped around initially, searching like tentacles, catching hold of the parts it could, the flesh re-knitting, re-forming, re-growing. New teeth popped out of my gums, the cheek still a mesh of muscle and flesh until within seconds it was as if I hadn't been shot. I spat the bullet out into my hand, holding it up, looking at it and then the man with a gun with an angry scowl.\n\nHe didn't cry or fall to his knees and claim me as his new God, I'd give him that, it wouldn't be the first time that had happened after all. He did however suddenly acquire a case of speechlessness and 'frozen in terror'. I took a step towards him and he flinched back. Grabbing the gun around the barrel, he fired a second shot in fear, it went into my abdomen and out through a kidney, nothing major, I held tight and it stopped the next bullet being put into the chamber. He started to whimper a bit now, my respect for him falling drastically as he started to plead, mumbling something between please and no. It's funny how he had probably come in here knowing he'd either shoot himself or get shot by cops and yet still the unknown is capable of scaring him. I wrenched the gun from his hand, \n\n\"You know...\" \n\nI growled in a deep quiet tone, \n\n\"...that kind of hurt.\"\n\nI'd left after that, obviously, can't really teach a bunch of kids much after showing them a scene like that. They'd get stories from the kids, put it down to mass hysteria and post traumatic stress and probably just file a missing persons report for Robert Orus... I really hope the police at least get that joke, if anyone should, you'd think it'd be a detective. Perhaps they'd suspect me for the death of the gunman, but he'd already shot some innocent people on the street and an off duty police officer, I doubt anyone was too broken up about his death. Besides, they usually wouldn't put a death like that down to human hands, it'd take a while to clean up the remains, many of the kids probably wouldn't recover after watching someone destroy another human being like that, but oh well, they're alive, what more can they ask for. I pulled up the collar of my long dark coat against the cold sea breeze, stuffed my hand into my pocket, pulling out two bullets that I flung to my side and into the water as I boarded the cargo ship. I could do with some time off anyway.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389849635","downs":0,"edited":"1389850258","gilded":0,"id":"ceqtlhv","link_id":"t3_1vbb5w","name":"t1_ceqtlhv","parent_id":"t3_1vbb5w","retrieved_on":1431964206,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"Captainsuperdawg","body":"Fred's heart was failing. He'd been a coal miner in Kentucky for years when he was younger and never took care of himself. Only recently had he even seen anybody about his health, and that was only because Elizabeth, his wife, had nagged him almost to death. The diagnosis wasn't good. Fred had congestive heart failure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and emphysema, to name a few. His last check up was way back in 2003, and even then, it was just because his gallbladder had been acting up and causing pain for long enough. How he'd managed to stay alive to live past 70 was a medical mystery. But Fred and Elizabeth lived a happy life, for better or for worse until death do they part.\n\nUnfortunately for Fred, that last part came to play not long after his doctor's visit. Elizabeth, much like her stubborn husband, wasn't a fan of going to the doctor. One morning, teaching a lady's Sunday school class at her church, she suffered a heart attack that proved to be fatal. Fred, who was just a door down, rushed to be by her side and didn't leave it for anything. Not in the ambulance, not in the hospital. Only when the coroner came to take her away did he part with her, and it wasn't for a lack of trying. Even for an old man with enough illnesses to stop the most spry young person, it took the full strength of Fred's two muscular sons to hold him back. Fred, in no mood to go home and be reminded of his lost love, stayed with his youngest son and daughter-in-law that night and cried for the first time in a long time. \n\nThe next couple weeks went by in a haze. There were funeral arrangements, burial plans, and so many more things that Fred never thought he'd be prepared for to take care of. He'd always joked that he would be the first to die because Elizabeth was good with planning things like this. Oh how he wished he was right. *Nobody should have to go through this,* he thought during the service. It was a lovely service. Everyone there was brought to tears, although, whether that had been the preacher's doing, or Elizabeth's was undecided. She'd led a wonderful life filled with love and was missed by all the lives she touched. After the service was over and after Elizabeth had been lowered into the ground, Fred went back to his house that he couldn't bear to call a home any longer, his late wife's clothes still hanging in the closet. The bed they shared just the way she made it before leaving that day. He laid down on the bed and sobbed, the second time in a week. \n\nDays passed, turning into weeks. Fred was never alone once, his sons' wives and his grandchildren were close by, often visiting him while his boys worked, and staying and playing while Frank told them stories of his childhood at their request. How he was the rowdiest boy around, constantly making trouble for his momma and never learning his lesson. His sons often came by after work as well. Their dad had always been there for them, they were simply returning the favor. He was never alone, but he was lonelier than ever. As time passed and the loneliness surrounded him, Fred began to stop taking his medications regularly, then at all. He didn't care anymore, and his health started worsening. \n\nOne night, as he lay in bed, months after saying goodbye to his wife, Fred began to be unable to breathe. His failing heart couldn't pump blood out well enough, and fluid backed up into his lungs. *Finally. I've always wanted to drown,* he thought, *Ever since she went away.* As he lay there, drifting away, he couldn't help but think about seeing his Elizabeth again, wondering if, in the next life, she'd reprimand him for not taking his pills and keeping himself healthy. It was worth it, he decided. It was all worth it to see her again. As he slipped away, a smile on his face formed. He was going to see her soon, and that was all that mattered.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389865836","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceqxlvl","link_id":"t3_1vcci7","name":"t1_ceqxlvl","parent_id":"t3_1vcci7","retrieved_on":1431966076,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"sirbayer","body":"\"I have made,\" Drew muttered, sitting up slowly, \"a grave miscalculation.\" None of the other hostages were too eager to start talking. That wasn't too surprising; many of them were already bleeding a little. The criminals, then, weren't scared to rough up their hostages. No surprise the back of his head hurt so much either. \"Any of you get a count on them? See any patterns, get any names?\" No responses. Drew experienced frustration. There was nobody here with the guts to even consider resistance in the theoretical. It was a good thing he was here. Hell, this was a bump in the road, but it'd make it a lot easier to lose heat when he left.\n\n\"Okay. Does anybody have the time?\" he asked, again scanning the room. The lights were off, but the light from the lobby still illuminated parts of the room. Scared teenager, scared old man, scared young woman. All the faces were the same. Not a single look of anger. These clowns were damned lucky they didn't have any weekend warriors. They obviously hadn't planned for it, since all the doors in this office were hanging open, and there wasn't a single goddamn guard on the hostages. Hell, they'd *taken* hostages, that was their biggest mistake. It implied they intended on staying. \"They're probably angling for the vault,\" Drew observed to the room. \"Not a smart decision. It takes too long to crack something that big open.\"\n\nNo, they weren't the cleverest kittens, were they? They'd gotten his USP... and put it on the desk in the next office over. Unguarded. Oh, but they had closed the door and locked it. Nevermind the thin glass wall between him and it. They really thought that'd be secure. And they'd gotten his gun, but they'd left his *shoes*, which meant the little switchblade in the sole was still there. It was more than up to the task of cutting the ziptie around his wrists, which left him free to stand. \"And look at that. No guards, no plan, no procedure. They're winging it. I bet they don't even have a backup.\"\n\nFirst he wandered over to the door that was 'holding' his USP, slipped the switchblade into the frame, jiggled the handle, and opened the door. It wasn't a secure lock; it wasn't intended to be. They, being stupid, had obviously not realized this. His pistol was still loaded, and the magazines had been left right next to it; he slipped all of them back into their holster, tucked his suit jacket back down, and grinned. \"That much is done. Now let's have a look. Still have my flash drive, they got my phone, still got my wallet, still got my *keys*. No, this is about as much as I walked in with.\"\n\n\"Don't go out there,\" some mumbled hoarsely. \"They'll kill us all. They have machine guns.\"\n\n\"Well they didn't bring a crew-served weapon, I'm guessing, and small arms aren't going to cut it for them here.\" Drew approached the doorway and peeked around the corner. Three right there, submachine guns, and a drill they were trying to attach to the vault. Just like he figured. \"See, I may not look it, but I'm not actually stupid enough to go out while I'm outgunned. No, I have a backup plan, and that backup plan is bringing a battle rifle.\" And he'd have advantage on terrain - Paul would be entering from the balcony overhead, and most likely they wouldn't have time to react. A clock in the lobby clued him in; about two minutes before the contingency went into effect. At least he hadn't missed it.\n\n\"Look at that #BADWORDS#.\" Drew sighed in disgust. \"They aren't even getting any real money. They're walking *right by* the damned computers. Idiots. The cash is literally right there. They're putting lives on the line for the few million they've got in paper here.\" They deserved to get popped for that. And they would be, very shortly. Drew had planned for something like this, just in case. His USP came back out of its holster and he tensed slightly. Sixty seconds. \"Alright, folks, stay calm. In about two minutes I should have time to come untie you. If I don't get around to it, as long as I'm not dead and they are, just go for the front door, you don't have to stay. Until then, just keep quiet. You leave alive and I leave a billionaire.\" Thirty seconds now. Twenty. Fifteen. Ten.\n\n\"Are - are you a cop?\" a teen asked hopefully. Drew paused and considered that question thoughtfully, tilting his head to the side. A year or two ago, if corporate security counted as a cop, then yes. Today was different. He wasn't a cop anymore...\n\n\"No, just a better robber.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389875152","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceqz236","link_id":"t3_1vbrqc","name":"t1_ceqz236","parent_id":"t3_1vbrqc","retrieved_on":1431966715,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

Mathern tried to follow Oswin on his seven hundreth birtday. He missed his heart. The wound was debilitating, but not lethal. He has no strength to try again. I turn nine hundred and fifty-three at midnight. Mathern turns nine hundred and fifty-one. I couldn't kill him.\n\nI couldn't do it.\" I blinked back tears.\n\nThe queen stepped down from her dais and circled the coffin I had built. A coffin of gold, decorated with rubies red as blood.\n\n\"You're brother Mathern is within?\" She asked.\n\n\"He is.\" I replied.\n\n\"Kill him. Do it now, and I will give you that which you desire above all else.\" She was noble, brave, and her decree was anything but a command.\n\n\"I can't live alone.\" I sobbed. \"Please don't make me.\"\n\n\"Kill him. Be merciful.\" She studied me. She was testing me. I opened the coffin. He was there, breathing slow. His face a mask of pain. A mask he'd worn for over two-hundred and fifty years. A mask I gave him to wear.\n\n\"She wants me to kill you.\" I explained. My tears spilled slowly, making a splat sound in the bottom of the coffin.\n\n\"Please,\" he begged. His eyes were earnest.\n\nI took up the knife she gave me and set the point over his heart. He reached up weakly and tried to force the blade in himself. I realized it was what he really wanted. He'd suffered enough. I cried harder and shoved the knife in till the tip struck the bottom of the gold coffin.\n\n\"Well done.\" The queen applauded. \"I wasn't sure you'd be up to the task.\"\n\n\"I'm all alone now.\" \n\nThe queen smiled. \"Are you, dear brother?\" \n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, coming around the coffin.\n\n\"I know. It's been nine hundred and twenty-three years, but do you not recognize your own sister?\" She asked.\n\n\"Cali?\" He asked.\n\n\"Queen Calidora,\" She replied.\n\n\"Why did you leave?\" I asked, daring to approach her royal personage. The court gasped and the guards moved to block my way.\n\n\"To avoid this very situation. I knew what father's gift was going to do to us. I knew and I couldn't stand the idea of watching my family die one by one. After Egon, I had to leave. I had to learn to love the solitude. You all died that day for me. \n\nBut, here we are in different lands. My men I sent to conquer, and what should they find, but an immortal guarding a golden coffin in a sealed crypt. Have you any idea the feelings and confusion I felt to learn that after nine hundred and fifty years, my brothers were still alive? The queen wept.\n\nI cried.\n\n\"What is wrong?\" She asked. \"You are not alone.\"\n\nI swallowed. \"Yes. Yes, I am.\"\n\nThe queen was confused. \"Explain, brother. Why do you feel you're still alone?\" The queen winced in pain.\n\n\"Because, I was sent to kill you.\" He replied. \"I didn't know you were my sister.\" I replied, falling to my knees in my despair.\n\n\"What?\" She asked, grimacing now. Her stomach felt like it was on fire. \"What have you done?\" She asked.\n\n\"I poisoned you.\" He got up and went back to the coffin and pulled the knife from his dead brother's heart. The queen stumbled forward and went to her knees. I climbed the steps slowly. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe guards moved to stop him, but she stopped them with a raised hand and a word. I climbed the steps and knelt before her.\n\nThe clock in the city sounded its bells. It was midnight.\n\n\"It's my birthday.\" I said. Blood ran from her eyes like crimson tears.\n\n\"Happy birthday, big brother.\" She gasped, spraying my armor with tiny flecks of red. I cut away the straps binding my armor. The plate covering my chest fell away. I removed my padding and tore open my white linen smock. \"Thank you, little sister.\" I said, plunging the knife into my own heart. She collapsed and fell forward, hugging me. We remained that way for a long time. The last two immortals locked in an embrace of love.\n\nEdit: Oh my god, thanks for the reddit gold. I'm flattered.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389887086","downs":0,"edited":"1407374409","gilded":1,"id":"cer2h5t","link_id":"t3_1vcrqw","name":"t1_cer2h5t","parent_id":"t3_1vcrqw","retrieved_on":1431968592,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":10}

{"archived":true,"author":"ArrightNowFellas","body":"Warning: Completely unedited, might be #BADWORDS#.  \n  \nPhilip and I had our disagreements, like anyone.  It was normal. Healthy. That's what the counselor told us.   \n\"Try something new. Revive your romance,\" she said, her horn-rimmed spectacles staring us in the eyes like a pea#BADWORDS# intent on examining your every move. So we took the train to Portland and, sitting side by side on dirty cloth seats, talked about ourselves. He said that I was too excitable, too energetic about *everything*. It was true. I had come home the other night to a silent TV and Philip sitting quietly in front of it.  \n\"What's wrong?\" I asked, setting down my messenger bag. He looked up at me, his face surprised, like he hadn't heard me come in.  \n\"Nothing. I'm just... sitting here.\" It was like that a lot. I got up one morning at six to put on some bacon and eggs for him. When we first started dating, he said his mom made it every morning through middle school. His mom had passed away soon after, and there weren't any more bacon and eggs. He came downstairs in his bathrobe and saw me standing there, examining the sizzling meat. I hadn't remembered the story about his mom when I decided to make it.  \nIt were these little things that made us drift apart. I acted too quickly, without thinking, too focused on the moment to see the future. He was too calm, too bored all the time, too collected to enjoy life. That's why I fell in love with him.  \nI don't know why he fell in love with me.  \nSarah and I used to talk about him a lot, back when we first started dating. He was perfect, I had said. She looked at me, one eyebrow raised, sipping an espresso with a finger held up. Always skeptical. That is, until she met James. They were ideal for each other, it seemed. Just different enough to be interesting, but not so different that they weren't compatible. Not like Philip and I. As time went on and we started to see the counselor, Sarah and James were still together. No kids, like us, just because Sarah didn't want them. She never had, ever since middle school sex ed when the teacher asked every girl in the class. One girl said she wanted a million. Only the teacher knew she was Mormon.  \nSarah called me on a Sunday. I was writing a lecture, she was standing in the pouring rain. I could hear it through the phone, the pounding of the droplets on her umbrella.  \n\"We should have a date!\" she said, voice loud but unclear over the phone.  \n\"Sarah? What? A date? Like a double date?\" I said. A pause.  \n\"Yeah, yeah. Are you busy tonight?\" she asked.  \n\"Tonight?\"  \n\"We have reservations at that bar on Congress. James just called, they have two more slots.\"  \n\"I'm not.. I guess so. Phil isn't here, he'll be home around five, but- \"  \n\"Perfect. I'll see you there!\"  \nIt was always like this. Talking to Sarah was like being on the receiving end of a machine gun, peppered with question bullets without a chance to speak. Then, suddenly, she would go silent, lean in, and listen. Her eyes seemed to sink into every single sentence you spoke. Those were special moments, for both of us. I remember sitting on my bed in the eighth grade with my mother making cookies downstairs while I complained about Gary Jennings. We would lie back and stare at the ceiling, the glow-in-the-dark stars that were long since faded seemingly so far above us. I was lucky to have her as a friend. Especially now.  \nPhilip and I climbed out of the car, our heads suddenly soaked with water. He pulled his pea coat tighter around himself. I had forgotten a jacket. I walked as fast as I could in heels, sliding over the ice with every step I took, until I reached to door and held on for dear life. I swung it open and the warmth of the restaurant flooded out. Philip crouched under the doorway, and the sound of the outside suddenly stopped. It was like any other bistro, with wall sconces from Ikea and plenty of bad modern art. Over in the corner, James waved to us. Sarah was deep in the menu, but looked up when James whispered in her ear. A smile lit up her face. We hurried over, still chilled from the rain, and slid into the booth.  \n\"Darlings, how are you?\" Sarah asked. \"So sorry we couldn't talk on the phone earlier, I was at the bank and the cashier said it was technically against policy to make a call inside, so I had to go out in the rain, but you know that.\" She laughed.  \n\"Oh Philip, I feel like I haven't seen you in ages! What's it been? Three months? Four?\" He nodded.  \n\"Too long.\" He wasn't one for unnecessary description. She laughed again.  \n\"Of course. James, don't be so rude, tell them about the coast.\" He looked up from the menu, his hair slightly quiffed in the front and a sly smile. He was the dark and mysterious one, Sarah said. I had never seen anything in him, but then again Philip wasn't a godsend.  \n\"The coast, yes. We hardly saw San Fran but for all the fog, but besides that it was nice. San Diego is beautiful.\" Philip smiled, his rain-soaked hair dripping onto the table. Sarah rolled her eyes.  \n\"Pathetic. I'll tell them, if you insist on leaving out the best parts.\" James grinned at her, his eyes alight. He loved her. There was no question.  \nThe waitress arrived halfway through a cabbie who drove them to the wrong hotel, or wrong motel, Sarah couldn't quite remember. First Sarah's plate, then my bowl. The waitress began to pass the fish to Philip, and before he realised it was for James he reached out, hands lightly touching the ceramic. James, too, grabbed it, and for a moment they touched, before Philip pulled away. He took his own bowl and set it in front of him, then shoved his shaking hands into his lap. I ignored him.  \n\"James, you said you ran into someone the other day?\" He laughed.  \n\"Yeah, yeah. It was.. Tuesday? Wednesday. A couple buddies and I took lunch at Giovanni's, you know it, and we walk in at about 12:30. The waiter is at the podium, a bunch of menus in his hand and he's just looking behind him. Friend of mine coughs a little, thinking that the guy didn't hear us come in. He turns around, eyes bugged out, and says, 'Look over there. See him? That's *Darrel Black*. We all kindof look at each other, no idea who this guy is. So I'm like, 'Who's Darrel Black?' Turns out, thats the real name of Jay Z. Having lunch. At Giovanni's. How crazy is that?\" Philip laughed. Sarah and I smiled. A bird started to chirp, and James picked up his phone.  \n\"Sorry. Have to take this.\" He stood up and walked over to the bathroom.  \n\"Crazy at work lately. There's this new client who's all up in arms about the facade- but you don't want to hear about that.\" Sarah said. She grins at me. \"I want to hear about school.\"  \n\"What's there to say? We started the Spanish Civil War.\" Sarah laughed.  \n\"I assume they're all psyched about that.\"  \n\"It's actually very interesting.\"  \n\"I'm sure.\" Philip didn't say anything. The conversation paused for a moment as we all took a bite. I savored it. Delicious.  \nJames appeared at the table, his face pale.  \n\"I have to go. I'm very sorry, all of you. Sarah.\" She twisted her eyebrows in confusion.  \n\"James, if anything's hap- \"  \n\"I love you.\" He left.  \n\"I, uh.\" Sarah's voice was cracking. \"I'm very sorry, he sometimes... does that.\" I looked at her, just as bewildered. Philip got up again, still silent.  \n\"Excuse me. Be back in a moment.\" He stepped into the bathroom. Sarah leaned back in her seat. All of the sudden, she looked tired. I had never noticed it before, the slight wrinkles below her eyes, the laugh lines becoming more pronounced.  \n\"Anya.\" She said my name, almost a whisper, like she was about to spill her deepest secret.  \n\"I can't do this, Anya.

{"archived":true,"author":"StoryboardThis","author_flair_text":"Moderator | /r/TheStoryboard","body":"I'd like to preface this by saying these are my impressions and critiques of your work. Nothing is meant to hurt, merely to help, and I apologize in advance if any of it seems harsh.\n\nFirst of all, congratulations!  Putting your work out there for critique is one of the harder parts of writing, and probably the most nerve-wracking.  You've cleared a hurdle that most people actively avoid, so well done.\n\n----\n\n**Strengths: Characterization and Compelling Inner Turmoil/Confusion.**\n\nIt's apparent from the start that you have a clear picture of who these two characters are in your head.  Even if readers were to discard the physical description completely - which is evocative, particularly where you describe the silver shimmer of Roseanna Figg's robes - they would not be left with a wispy framework of a half-baked character.  You succeed at throwing some real weight behind these two, and there's evidence to support this throughout the piece.\n\nThe conflict within Vernon Dursley - the desire to know himself, combated at every turn by his inexplicable aversion to anything that might shed light on his past - lends itself to its own back-story treatment, and I think you do it justice.  The reader sees the struggle unfold on the page in all its uncomfortable glory.  By the end, it's entirely believable that these sorts of encounters shaped the bristly head of the household at No. 4 Privet Drive.\n\n----\n\nNow to the tough stuff:\n\nOne common mistake many writers make is giving their characters large chunks of exposition and assuming they don't need to add any flavor.  Are there points when certain things need to be explained to either the reader or the other characters?  Absolutely.  Is it okay to let these vital plot points turn into a massive information dump?  Probably not.  [This page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition) should give you an idea of good and bad versions of the \"infodump.\"  As you can see, literary greats like Jules Verne, C.S. Lewis, and even J.R.R. Tolkien use this device to great effect.  It's all a matter of subtlety: pepper it with physical movement, stir in a bit of Q&amp;A, and you have yourself the same amount of exposition without all the dried-out bits hanging about.\n\n(On a side note, I'm not sure why that turned into a giant soup metaphor, exactly.  Should still work, though.  Might taste good, too, with a pinch of salt.)\n\n----\n\nAbout halfway through (though it does happen before this point as well), you start to get a bit heavy-handed with the dialogue.  It's clear that both Roseanna Figg and Vernon want the memories to come back; there's no use driving that point home so very many times.  Pick the sections you enjoy the most - \"He remembered a particularly thorough spanking for insisting he had seen a man wrapped almost entirely in bandages walking straight *through* a solid glass window into an abandoned department store,\" for example - and trim back the rest.  I see what you're trying to do by grouping things consistently in threes, but even that seemingly foolproof collection can be overdone.  If you combine some trimming here with some restructuring from my previous suggestion, you should end up with something a bit less wordy and a bit more cohesive.\n\n----\n\nA few minor things that I find make major differences:\n\n1) **When in doubt, use \"said\" instead.**  You'd think this would make your dialogue tags bland, but oftentimes it has the exact opposite effect.  The next time you find yourself reading a good book and you finish a section/chapter, go back and count how many times the dialogue tag \"said\" is used.  The results will surprise you.  It's just one of those words that makes any written conversation easier to read.\n\n2) **Big words are fine, but not all the time.**  As a rule of thumb when I edit, I purposely take a 5-second pause after any word or phrase that seems odd.  Whether I know what the word means or not is irrelevant; this exercise is meant to draw attention to things the average reader might stumble upon.  If someone who knows what \"innocuous\" or \"disgorging\" means has to take a moment to recall the definition, imagine how long someone who doesn't know the meaning will spend away from your story.  If a reader finds themselves caught up on something, the world you've created around them begins to crumble. Our goal, as writers, is to keep the suspension of disbelief alive as long as possible. It's one of the most difficult things to do, but it makes a world of difference.\n\n----\nHopefully you find some of this helpful, and I apologize for being rather verbose.  Feel free to ask any other specific questions you might have.  I'll try to get to them in a timely manner.\n\nAnd most importantly, thank you for putting yourself out there.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389949411","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cersegg","link_id":"t3_1veot1","name":"t1_cersegg","parent_id":"t3_1veot1","retrieved_on":1431980946,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

At that point he was unheard of, receding into training immediately afterwards.\n\nSat astride a frame built by microwave snacks and bags of crisps sat an old hooded jumper, with a new transfer \"대한민국\". The brand of the jumper had long since worn off. The hands wore thin fingerless gloves, brand new.\n\nNot much attention is paid to the clothing of compe#BADWORDS#ors in the gaming category, because most of the money is spent on the hardware. Mandated by the Olympic committees newly sourced experts. Being a relatively obscure and new compe#BADWORDS#on, some countries held back on the vim, more so on the vigour. The prize was relatively small you see. So why spend a lot of money for a small chance at a smaller sum?\n\nThe other compe#BADWORDS#or was already seated.

This last point being the decider, the players skirted the map, hiding in wait. After 30 seconds of neither player moving, the referee mandated movement. The players, suitably reprimanded set off once more.\n\nRounding a corner, the Korean saw the tip of a gun barrel pointed in his direction. He strafed up bottom elbow, loosing a round and catching his opponent in the foot. He jumped and the bullet hit his shin...\n\nAnd he fell. Off the map. The game registered it as a kill to the opponent.\n\nHe had lost. The final.\n\nAnd calamitous din filled the stadium.

You can just put it into the narrative, which would make sense because everything else the character thinks is already formatted that way. In fact, it might be unnecessary for you to even include that line - context clues later make it clear where your protagonist is going.\n\nTwo, you have the protagonist examine the driver, but we never get a description of him.

{"archived":true,"author":"Perish_In_a_Fire","body":"Wrote something similar - only difference in my implementation is its mediated by technology, not a straight mental action. Also, once you get negative to a certain degree you're culled from society. I'll post the first part for your inspection/perusal.\n\n***\n\n#BADWORDS# hell, another redliner.\n\nShuffling by me on the sidewalk, head down and shoulders canted, fraying hood covering most of his face. My Personal Rating display showed a large red number hovering above him, minus ten thousand and counting, increasing with every step he took. No video stream going, no pings out to friends and neighbors to help. A dead zone of seeming calm while death inched ever closer.\n\nYou see that every once in a while, the ones that give up, that is. Instead of running or trying to spam a local beg-cast, they just walk aimlessly until the rangers close in. Sometimes, in the last few minutes they make a half-hearted attempt to avoid the authorities, but that never ends well.\n\nIt was the girl that bothered me the most. She had been on the green side, just barely - until a group of her peers decided it was time to shut her out. She wandered wild-eyed, voice cracking while she begged anyone in her extended network to help. Burning cred like crumpled paper in a fire, an asymmetrical transaction increasing the velocity of her Personal Rating Account to negatives I had never seen before.\n\nI threw in several kays of green pozzies early on, but they were eaten up instantly by her frantic bandwidth usage.\n\nShe was huddling in a park with her personal video stream still going, singing a lullabye to herself when the rangers got to her. The feed cut out before the actual act, but I knew she was dead. Voice halted between a beat in the notes, her last words hanging in the air as the feed stuttered into pixelated chaos.\n\nThat's life, I guess.\n\nIts also the reason why I'm careful to pick my words and consider my actions. You can't be reckless in this world, no way. Even though it seems to outsiders like a high price to pay, I'd take it any day over the social lawless past, where anyone could do horrible things without any thought to the consequences.\n\nSpeaking of consequences, I'd better hear back from the agency or they're going to get a nice big negative rating on their turnaround time. Rent was coming due, and if I didn't have the proper credit sent in a timely manner, I'd be on the receiving end of some negative ratings, mostly from my roommates and the leasing company.\n\nIt was worse if your neighbors found out, many would just neg you for being a \"freeloader\", even if you came up with the payment after. Hard to ask forgiveness after the fact, even though it would cost relative strangers more points to neg me, some didn't seem to mind.\n\nThat was how the system worked, the closer someone is in your social network the less it cost in green to negatively rate you. That association was determined by several factors, all of which were stored somewhere in the zottabytes of information swirling around the planet.\n\nDistributed systems kept the whole thing in check. There wasn't a central location with servers buzzing and humming with data. The old methods were long gone, replaced by the spooky action of entanglement and quantum dots flipping bits over planetary distances with scarcely a blip in normal time. There were an equal mix of networked things and dumb objects, but the planet had increasingly become linked in this way, with a nearby brick more likely to be able to answer a navigation query than a old compass in a museum ever could.\n\nEven with this in place, there were earlier attempts at rate-spoofing. Getting a bunch of people together in a small social space, forging connections and then going to town on the green or red side pozzing friends or negging enemies, but the backend algorithms picked up on the falsehood. Their verdict was swift - instant redline for every one of the participants. The cries for help broadcast around the world were enough of a deterrent that nobody ever dared to do it again.\n\nEvery once in a while the video clip of the cheaters would resurface, showing the scattering people, the screams and dronefire, until there was only the hollow sound of newly fabbed shells hitting the floor. Nearly the entire planet viewed it live, the video feed bandwidth being part of the negative rating tsunami that condemned the spoofers to an early grave.\n\nOver time, certain basic rules were passed down from those that had lead rewarding lives, the main benefit being able to gift a small percentage of their positive ratings to their offspring. Although most of that balance would be whittled down in the early years, when crying toddlers and petulant teenagers were more apt to annoy others with their childish actions and bad manners, in addition to the costs of just staying alive.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389980421","downs":0,"edited":"1389980685","gilded":0,"id":"ces0z5c","link_id":"t3_1ves0p","name":"t1_ces0z5c","parent_id":"t3_1ves0p","retrieved_on":1431985076,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"golf4miami","body":"\"I'm sorry sir that's just not how it works.\" Mr. Polluck my lawyer said. It was easy for him to say too because he knew the law inside and out and because of it had refused to get married. \"When you get married and you give your heart to your lover you can never get it back. It is theirs forever unless they decide, *on their own*, to give it back to you. You know this Jackson, we've gone over it 100 times before.\" \n\nHe was right. In the months leading up to my divorce with my cheating #BADWORDS# of a wife I had asked of him this exact question probably even more times than the hundred he gave me credit for. I just couldn't believe it. She had stolen my good heart and used it to #BADWORDS# around. I guess I should have known better getting married to a stripper, but she seemed different.\n\n\"Who makes up such a stupid #BADWORDS# law anyway!?\" I asked to no one in particular. \n\n\"They said it was supposed to cut down on the amount of people rushing into marriages.\" Polluck said. Sitting behind his large oak desk, leaning back in his giant leather chair almost snickering at me as he ran his hands through is slicked back hair. He was so damn smug at the fact that he had avoided the whole marriage thing, he would never have to deal with a mess like this. \"Which in turn was supposed to cut down on the number of divorces. The whole thing was the Church's idea.\" \n\n******\n\nThirty minutes later after solving absolutely nothing I was in my red Ford F-150 cruising down the highway at faster speeds than normal. I didn't care, I wasn't even looking at my speedometer. The only thing pulling me over would do is to delay the inevitable. I was going to get what was truly mine back and there wasn't anything anyone could do about it. \n\nMy hunting knife felt heavier in my right pocket as I made the right hand turn off the highway down the road where I knew she would be. *The Lonely Beaver Club* was only a few miles away and I knew she had a show that began in just a few minutes. Luckily just like the highway there were no cops in sight further down the road. In fact there were very few cars at all. \n\nTurning right into the gravel parking lot *her* heart started to beat a little faster inside me. I found a parking spot near the front. It was no wonder she hardly came home with any tips after working the day shift, there were only four other cars in the parking lot. I realized that this meant a smaller chance for collateral damage and a good chance no one here will be armed. I know for a fact that the #BADWORDS# owner thought that since the club is out in the boondocks that no one would ever come there looking for trouble. He clearly had this coming to him.\n\nI gathered my thoughts and stepped out of my truck. I patted it's hood as I walked by as a thank you for getting there safely and walked inside. It was dark, musty, and smelled of cigarette smoke. Why is it that #BADWORDS# bars always have to be so damn typical? A faint blue light shone across the room from the neon behind the bar advertising some #BADWORDS# piss water beer I'm sure. \n\n\"Ladies,\" there were no ladies here, \"and gentlemen! Please welcome to the stage, Foxx Fur!\" I winced at the sound of her stage name. I had asked her when we first met why she choose such a ridiculous name and she had related it to her childhood and how much she liked foxes, or some dumb #BADWORDS# like that. My eyes focused on her and the lights blinded her from seeing me in the corner of the room.\n\nBefore anyone realized it I was on the stage and on top of her. She screamed at first, then after realizing it was me she started to laugh. I'm sure she thought it was some kind of joke I was playing on her. Trying to get her back, or something. I reached for the knife in my pocket and in one swift motion it was in her chest. \n\nYou could hear a pin drop other than the knife slicing through her body. Even she didn't scream before she passed out of shock. I used the sedated side of the knife to saw through her ribs. The sound wasn't unlike that of sawing through wood, just wetter, and with blood everywhere. In fact the blood made a good lubricant for the sawing.\n\nThere it was! My heart! Still slowly beating from within her chest. I ripped it out and gave it a quick squeeze as if to say it was all ok and that it was back home with it's owner. I could hear people slowly moving towards me getting ready to ambush me now that my former wife was for sure dead. They didn't want to be next. \n\nBefore they could get any closer I stood up on my knees, turned the sharp end of the blade towards my chest and plunged it in. It was amazing how much it didn't hurt. It must have been the adrenaline because I didn't feel a thing. It wasn't long until I could see *her* heart inside my own chest cavity. I tore it out just like I had removed mine from her chest. I watched it take a couple beats in my hand and dropped it back into the hole in her stomach to put it back where it belonged. \n\n ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1389993089","downs":0,"edited":"1389994804","gilded":0,"id":"ces6vos","link_id":"t3_1vh0uv","name":"t1_ces6vos","parent_id":"t3_1vh0uv","retrieved_on":1435527582,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

I had no idea who sent it or what it was at first, my curiosity keeping me from leaving it alone. It was simple in design too, a simple white rubber eraser carefully nestled in the white downy pillow inside. It was warm to the touch, radiating a feeling of calmness. I was confused by its use at first, testing it on papers and stains, all of them quickly disappearing with a simple rub of the eraser. The white body stayed pure, the warmth increasing the more I used it in one sitting.\n\nIt was when I was rolling it between my hands did I notice it did more than removed mistakes. Small scars on my hands disappeared, leaving behind perfect skin. I was stunned but moved it to more pink lines that marred my body, the lines on my wrists from several attempts, the fresh bruises from the abuse; all of it disappeared without any effort. A wave of relief washed over me, the awkward conversations as to why I had marks on my body, gone, the judging from others who saw the scars on my arms, disappeared.\n\nI found a more beneficiary use of the eraser one night. He returned home, drunk, looking for his punching bag. No, not tonight, I was done with this life. The knife to his stomach was easy, the blade one of the sharpest someone could buy. The slice ran from just below his rib cage on one side down towards his hip, slipping everything to the floor. He fell, gurgling for me to help him until the breath stilled, his large frame limp on the floor. It was all on carpet, easy to clean, especially with my new tool. With my heart pounding, I took the eraser in hand and waved it over him, piece by piece of his corpse disappearing into nothing, the blood on the floor gone before it even could cool. The virgin white body now had a slight pink color to it, one that could be found on a flower, and my problems were now gone.\n\nI didn't cry for him that night, or the next day, or at all. The police came and went, asking questions, searching the house, suspecting that someone had killed him on his way home from the bar, that I couldn't have done anything. With him gone, I was free, but a new threat grasped at me. The taste of blood was fresh on my tongue, the smell of death lingering in my nose, and I wanted more.\n\n-017","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390024488","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cesiy82","link_id":"t3_1vezt4","name":"t1_cesiy82","parent_id":"t3_1vezt4","retrieved_on":1431994058,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Your presence could cause him to die.\"\n\n\"Promise,\" the man asked, adjusting his thin blood red tie. The doctor noticed it and found it bizarrely fascinating. the mans suit was too. There seemed to be a faint silvery brocade or pinstripped s#BADWORDS#ch to it, but it was shifting and hard to focus on.\n\n\"You're going to have to leave.\" The doctor ordered, hanging the clipboard he carried in on the foot of the patient's bed. \"Now. Leave or I'm calling security. This man is frail and something simple as a common cold could kill him in this state.\"\n\n\"I know, Simon. I'm *praying* for that common cold you mentioned.\" The man's smile was slick and oily. His smile seemed to wide. His eyes seemed to suck up the light and twinkle just the same. His hair was as black, but greying around his sideburns.\n\n\"How do you know my name?\" The doctor asked, suddenly curious. The silvery spiderwebs of embroidery on his suit kept drawing him in. There was something there.\n\n\"I know everyone, Simon--Dr. Marlow. You don't like being called Simon. You spent to much time and money earning that #BADWORDS#le of Doctor to be addressed without it. Kit Lawson learned that lesson, didn't he?\" The man in black smiled a toothy smile. The doctor went pale. \"Relax, Simon. Your secret is safe with me. I knew Kit. He deserved that injection you gave him. Hell, I even admired handiwork for a time.\"\n\n\"You need to leave,\" the doctor gasped, coming forward.\n\n\"It takes some real anger to blind a former classmate for refusing to call you doctor, Doctor.\" The man in the black suit reached out for the man in the bed and stopped, closing his hand just shy of the body.\n\n\"How do you know about that,\" the doctor demanded, coming up shy of the stranger.\n\n\"You know I know it. Let's move past how, I know it, and move right into what it's going to take for me to keep your secret, *Simon*?\" The stranger's smile was broad as ever, but there was a muted strain of anticipation in the look he gave the doctor.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Simon asked, surrendering resolve.\n\n\"Kill this man. Take him off life support. He's dying anyway. You'll be . . . putting him out of his misery. Pull the plug. End his suffering. Let me have him.\" The stranger's eyes seemed to darken and the look he gave the patient wasn't friendly. It was almost a hungry look.\n\n\"Why do you want him dead?\" The doctor asked, refusing to capitulate without an explaination. \n\n\"Curiosity? I wouldn't have guessed that. My explaining is not part of this transaction. I have your balls in my hand. I expect you to do as you're told, unless you'd like others to know about your classmate's murder.\" The stranger stepped up to the doctor,  his nose inches from the doctor's. \"I will have my due.\" He hissed angrily.\n\n\"I didn't kill him. I gave him the injection and blinded him, but I didn't kill him.\" The doctor told him, indignant and insulted.\n\n\"He lost his vision while he was driving. He never would have crossed the center line and hit that truck if you hadn't given him the shot. You killed him. You murdered him. You are a very bad man, and that is #BADWORDS# sexy.\" The stranger whispered warmly in the doctor's ear. \"I will have my due.\"\n\n\"What due?\" Simon snapped, staggering away from the man in black.\n\n\"The Devil's due.\" The man replied. His eyes glowed like embers in the bottom of a cold camp fire. \"Kill him. I am owed a soul. I will not be denied.\" His cool demeanor was disappearing fast. The Devil's smile seemed strained.\n\n\"Tell you what, Simon. I'll let you wander in Limbo feeling nothing for a few hundred years, before I come to collect your soul. I can wait for yours, but this soul here. It is being denied me. I'm under the gun as it were. End him, and let me feast. He owes the Devil, and the devil owns you.\" The man in black circle the bed like a vulture circling carrion. The doctor looked on his suit as he passed and fell back. It wasn't embroidery. It was tortured souls swimming in the black, silvery against the abyss behind them.\n\nThe doctor looked on the Devil with new eyes and was afraid. He turned his head like a beaten child and watched him from the corner of his eyes.\n\n\"Now, Simon!\" The Devil roared.\n\nSimon hunkered down, cowering in fear. He scampered over to the machine and grabbed the plug. He glanced at the devil, his breath coming fast, then looked at the terminal patient sleeping peacefully.\n\n\"No.\" Simon whispered.\n\nThe Devil marched around the bed, once more moving his face within inches of the Doctor's. \"You didn't say that.\" The Devil told him, a threat implied by his tone.\n\n\"I didn't kill him, but I caused the accident that did. I've lived with that guilt since college. I deserve to burn for that. I did in anger. I won't compound it by killing someone else out of fear. Leave.\" The doctor ordered. \"Leave and go back to Hell. You can't have him. Not today.\"\n\nThe Devil smiled suddenly and stepped back. \"Fine.\" He rumbled, his voice smooth and seductive. \"You denied me. I won't forget, *Simon*. The Devil's memory is long, and his mercy is legendary.\" The shadows deepened, filling the room. Simon blinked at the unnatural intrustion, and when he opened his eyes, the Devil was gone. Carved and smoldering and written on the wall before him was a single word that filled him with dread. \n\n*Soon.*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390069845","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cest2fj","link_id":"t3_1vifyb","name":"t1_cest2fj","parent_id":"t3_1vifyb","retrieved_on":1431998909,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"wiptaylo","body":"   Louis Sodheimer stood outside the door to his cramped studio apartment, his hand hovering over the doorknob. His mind wandered. On the other side of the door was a hit squad of Korean assassins, armed to the teeth and waiting. He would open the door, and, with the special training he has never received, he would proceed to take them out, one by one. Then he would track down the sonofa#BADWORDS# who ordered a hit on him. Vengeance would be his. \n\n   A ringing from inside his apartment brought Louis back. He opened the front door and strode in his studio apartment. The room was as empty as it always was when he wasn’t there. On the floor next to his mattress was the landline. He walked across the small room to the phone and picked it up. Maybe one day he would get a cell phone. He supposed that they would be useful. \n\n   “Hello?” He said. \n\n   “Mr. Sodheimer?” A voice on the other line asked. “This is Zachary’s mother. I was just calling about what happened today. He says you gave him detention again.” \n\n   Louis rubbed his eyes. The kid was a nightmare. He was in the tenth grade and insisted on eating chalk and starting fights. They didn’t pay him enough for this job. “Yes ma’am. Well it was a similar event to last month. He was disrupting class and threw a textbook at another boy.”\n\n   “Well, you know how boys are always rough housing, now.”\n\n   “It hit him in the eye. He went to the hospital.”\n\n   “Ah. Well, he shouldn’t have let himself get hit like that. Serves him right.” She said it with all the conviction of a loving mother who has no idea that her child is the spawn of satan.\n\n   “Zack was lucky that a detention was all he got. Principal Holden will be looking into the whole matter and make a final judgement on what his punishment will be.”\n\n   “But isn’t there anything-”\n\n   “Look, I’ve had a long day. I don’t need to deal with this now. Goodbye Mrs. Garner.”\n\n   Louis hung up the phone and sighed. He would never have kids. Not only were they expensive, but they were a gamble. After years of putting time and effort into raising another human being, if they ended up an idiot, there’s not much you could do. He picked the phone back up and ordered a pizza. Pepperoni and spinach. Then, he turned on the television that was sitting on the floor. He flipped through the limited basic cable options until he realized that there really wasn’t anything on. \n\n   So he decided to play Stories.\n\n   Stories was an old game that he had made up one night while sitting alone inside one weekend. He would change the station to those old antique roadshow programs and come up with, you guessed it, stories. Whatever the antique, he would craft an elaborate fantasy for it. It passed the time. \n\n   After he had gone through about four objects, there was a knock on his door. Louis took one last glance back at the screen. A porcelain ballerina. That was a good one. As he walked to the door one part of his mind began to make up a history for the object. Another part fantasized that behind the door was a military general. The world was in danger and they needed him to step up and save the day. \nHe opened the door, and was only slightly disappointed to see the pizza delivery boy. He paid him and took the pizza back to his bed. \n\n   Louis opened the pizza box. There was the pepperoni. There was the spinach. And there...were the anchovies. He hadn’t ordered anchovies. He quickly dove into the possible meanings of this seemingly innocent mix up before he decided that they were probably dosed with radiation, and likely to give him super powers if he ate them. He scarfed down each piece with relish. \n\n   Sometimes, a simple story can make things better.

It is the end of one life and the start of another.  Every day, I help millions upon millions of people into the next world.  Together, we find their next life.  They are reborn.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be reborn.  I'll get cancer again.  I'll get sick again.\"  Charlie began to cry.  \"I want to be happy and live a normal life.  I want to be with my mom and dad and brother.  I want to go to school and play sports.  I want to meet a girl, and maybe go to prom.  I want to go to college so I can learn to do something and get a job and a house and raise a family with a dog.  I want to have children and I want to grow old with love in my heart.  I don't want to live just thirteen years with most of them spent in pain and sadness as everyone watches me decay.  I can't live this life again, Mr. Grim.\"\n\n\"No, no my boy, you will not!  You will be reborn anew.  The possibilities are endless.  You have all that and more.  All you must do is come with me.  Just...don't worry about the risks...\"\n\n\"Risks?\" asked the boy.  \"What risks?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Grim.  \"The life you have now is just the result of another life after many you've already lived, Charlie.  It's a cycle that will continue forever.  Who's to say that you won't be born with another problem?  Maybe your cancer strikes at an earlier age?  Or perhaps you're born deformed and tossed aside by your family?  Anything is possible, child.\"\n\nThe boy sat there in tears contemplating the life he was given.  \"Why would God do this to me?  He should be in my shoes and see what its really like.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Grim.  \"Him.\"  He sat on the edge of the dying boy's bed.  \"I've had to wait a long time for this, my boy.  I was forbidden to ever influence your opinion on *him*.  I've watched you for over three thousand lives, guiding you on to the next one and the next after that, hoping you will find it in you again...\"\n\n\"Find what?\" asked the boy curiously.\n\n\"Your malice toward God.  It is no accident that people will be reborn until the end of time.  And it is no accident that you, specifically, will forever and always be reborn with an ailment.\"\n\n\"I-I don't understand.  Why would God let this happen to us?  To me?\"\n\nMr. Grim sighed.  \"Because he does not care about the petty mortals of this Earth.  They are play toys that he became bored with.  They live, die, live and die again, never able to reach that which they seek: the afterlife.  I am forbidden to guide them there.  But for you, child, it is more.  Whereas every other person's existence is being wasted to the depths of time, yours is deeper than that.  Yours has true meaning, for yours is punishment.\"\n\n\"Punishment?  What did I do?\"  Charlie wiped his eyes with clenched fists.\n\n\"In time, you will remember.  For now, you have found your hatred for him, and that is a start.  Your power is unimaginable, and it has broken the curse set upon me.  I can finally guide the dead to where they belong in Heaven.  Even as we speak, I begin raising your army for the siege.\"\n\n\"Army?  Siege?\"  The boy was completely lost in the words of Mr. Grim.  \"I can't do any of that stuff.  What are you talking about, Mr. Grim?\"\n\n\"Oh, but you can,\" said an excited Death.  \"When you pass, you will remember everything.  Your true body, your true soul.  The memories of every sad life you've been forced to live and, most importantly, the one you were first given at the beginning of time itself.  They know your first name, your true name, and they will look up to it again.  Take my hand, child, and we will go together.  We will take back what belongs to you.\"\n\nCharlie reached out for the long, bony fingers of Mr. Grim's hand.  He did not know why, but it felt like the right thing to do.\n\n\"Will it hurt?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not at all.\"  Mr. Grim grasped his hand and opened the door to the world between time and space.\n\n\"Mr Grim, before we go...\"\n\n\"Yes, dear boy?\"\n\n\"What did you mean about my 'true' name?  What is my true name?\"\n\nMr. Grim's cold skull would smile if it could, but it merely leaned into the boy, lifted him into his arms, and held him close as if he were his own.\n\n\"Lucifer, my boy.

{"archived":true,"author":"Cfierro","body":"Dear 2013, \nRemember right before we met? On that last day of 2012? How I had been sick? I was so scared and sad. Remember that last night it was just Nathan and I ( Jaime had to work) and I was hoping so badly someone would invite us somewhere, anywhere! I didn't want to be alone with my thoughts. I wanted not to be introduced to you alone. But alas, that's what happened. My son and I fell asleep together that night praying that 2013 would change me for the better. \nI realised pretty early I wasn't that impressed by you. Jan-Mar was monotonous if anything. Still battling my infection, my depression, still clinging on to anyone who would listen asking if they could help me please. My daily uniform consisted of t-shirts and jeans. Hair up in a ponytail. I had lost 20 pounds being sick.I foundd myself counting the hours until it was time to go to sleep. When I was truly at peace. \nThen in March a bit of good news! My infection had cleared up! Many thanks to God but still having a hard time being alone. I can tell people are having a hard time understanding what I've turned into. I have grown comfortable with my sadness.\nIn May my father turned 60 and I wanted to celebrate it. So my brothers and I got together and 2013 you gave us a beautiful day and I put some make-up on, spent time and shared laughs with my family. I remember feeling happy that night. I could see how happy my dad was with us. That was happiness. I was grateful I could see that clearly.\nThen Nathan got really sick, what would normally be no big deal for most people was huge to me. His Dr. wanted me to treat him with antibiotics and I fought with him because I did not want too. I knew how irrational I was being but fear has a lot of power if you allow it . Thank goodness my dad was there to tell me to give it to him. That only God has control over what happens.so I did and he got better. But I got worse. I wrote about it. The anxiety and pain of waking up. The fear that controlled me. I found myself visiting my mothers grave often, wishing in a way I could be with her.\nI appreciated all the beautiful days you gave us so i could make all those beautiful drives to the ocean. Where Nathan and I would sit and listen to the waves and revel in the enormity of the ocean. I wondered how people could not believe in God. And my drive home would be filled with comfort.\nIn July I peeked and I allowed my depression to disappoint a friend. 2013 I was so mad at you and I struggled to come up with excuses and reasons. Apologies were profuse, but one day it just sort of hit me that to be truly sorry was to change my behavior or at least try. \nIn August you sent me some old friends and pushed me to see them. I was so happy, so pleased to see those familiar faces that were a big part of my life.\nIn Sep, you kept at it. Presenting me with opportunities to step out of my sad haze. Putting effort into my appearance, important because I could see the look in my husbands eyes when I would get ready and \"Tada\" whirl around for him as he told me I looked beautiful. It was getting easier to wake up. To run errands, to work. I became closer to people that I didn't expect too who constantly reminded me that this was my journey and to just enjoy the ride. I found myself strong enough to take a yearly trip with a good friend and my daughter that made me feel young again ( kinda).I visited my moms grave and told her I might not visit so much in the future. Only because I think I was holding on too her too much and I was trying to learn to live again.\nIn October we spent a wonderful time celebrating my daughters 21 bday with my extended family. Nathan went through a huge growth spurt and was talking so much. He is always saying he loves me. Which is nice. In November my son turned three and I was working more. I am starting to accept what letting go means. To give it to god. So much easier said than done. \nAnd then December, you got me with some pretty tough lessons 2013. I'm not going to lie. But I get it. You were trying to remind me to stay humble and the importance of forgiveness in my life. That to live life completely vulnerable might hurt a little, or bruise your ego but if you allow it , the pain will not be wasted. \nTonight is our last night together! It didn't seem like it at first with your tough love and all but you were a good friend. And tonight it will be my son and I alone again. But this time I'm looking forward to it. Tonight I'm at peace. Thanks for everything.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390200109","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceu1b4m","link_id":"t3_1vlwfd","name":"t1_ceu1b4m","parent_id":"t3_1vlwfd","retrieved_on":1432020336,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"Exmondias","author_flair_text":"http://darkhawk-365daysofstorytelling.blo#BADWORDS#.ca/","body":"The first one died from an infected cut along her nose. We didn't have the money to bring her to the vet. The truth is, we never should have owned dogs. My family was struggling to get by with clothing for three children and food enough for five, yet we decided to raise three dogs. I'm sure it felt like a pre-requisite to living on a farm, but the amount of care given to the dogs was less than ideal.\n\nI would have been mad at my family if I knew any better. I was just a kid in love with three dogs. They weren't rowdy, untrained, overbearing creatures to me; they were simply friends filled with too much love. I could have given them more care. I should have been a better friend.\n\nSo the Dalmatian - Bailey- who was always a bit snippy, bit the German Shepard -Tippy- on the nose. The cut was bad, but we didn't have the money. So we waited. For a week, it looked like it was getting better. I was hopeful. But another week passed and suddenly Tippy wasn't the rambunctious one anymore. The cut never seemed to change, but I remember the look in her eyes. If she were human, it would have been sadness. It would have been defeat.\n\nI don't know when she died. One night she was there, hiding away in her doghouse as I brought her food. The next, as I returned from school, I was told that her body had been buried out back. I never saw the corpse. I never saw the grave. I never said goodbye.\n\nThe second to go was Bailey. She was old, I know, and her hair had never done much good at providing insulation against the bone snapping cold of Minnesota. She had been the reason Tippy died, so it was not much of a surprise when my family was angry at her. My dad seemed to be the only one that noticed that she was dying too. He worked 14 hours through the night, and yet he would come home and spend hours out in the frigid cold trying to warm and comfort her.\n\nI don't know if she froze to death, or if she simply gave up after watching her lifelong companion die. I saw her corpse, days after she died, frozen in a curled up ball. She made no sound, but I imagined her high pitched whine calling out for me, \"Stay with me. Keep me warm. Please, stay with me.\"\n\nLosing two dogs in a week was hard enough, but I turned to my last dog for support. His name was Spot, for the large spot he had over one of his eyes. He was a mut, but large and never without desire to give you attention. Most of his life was spent chained to a tree, but he struggled constantly to pull himself free. Multiple chains were snapped, link by link as he yearned to spend more time with people. He managed to loosen collars, allowing himself to wiggle backwards until he was free.\n\nHe wasn't allowed inside, but he always found himself at our door, scratching and barking until someone would chain him up again. I don't know if he was lonely or if he just wanted to play, but I know that I never spent enough time with him until Bailey and Tippy had perished.  Much like my father had spent time with Bailey, I found myself spending late nights out with Spot in the cold, just cuddled up in the snow. I had a friend to take care of. I had failed the others, but I was going to do better with Spot. I was going to spend all of my free time with him. I was going to take care of him and make sure he wouldn't die too.\n\nUntil he did, three days later. I woke with the sunrise, excited for a new wintery day to spend with my pal. I looked out of my second story window to see if I could see him. I could. It looked as if he had broken free from his collar again. He was laying in the snow about halfway to the door of the house. A tree was blocking most of my vision, so I ran downstairs to see what he was doing.\n\nMy father was already standing at the door, looking out at the snow. He wasn't crying, but the air around him held the soul-crushing pain of a funeral. I followed his gaze to a mixture of blood and vomit that trailed from Spot's doghouse to his body some fifteen feet away. Spot was laying in the snow, unmoving. I asked my dad what happened, but he shook his head, unsure. Spot was dead. I was only ten, but I knew he was dead. There was too much blood. Too much vomit. My friend had died, alone, struggling with his last bloody breath to reach my doorstep.^-002","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390203388","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ceu28v3","link_id":"t3_1vlwfd","name":"t1_ceu28v3","parent_id":"t3_1vlwfd","retrieved_on":1432020773,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

On one mixtape I have Nine Inch Nails on one side and Enya on the other.  I listen to my walkman and go for long walks.  I go down to the south Jersey shore with my mom and dad so they can check on their house in the winter.  \n\nThe first thing I notice is how empty the town is, being that no one is there, and it's cold and windy.  No cars on the streets, maybe only one car in a parking lot- the owner of an Italian sandwich shop that stays open all year around.  We get to the house, and as we open the door and walk in, the smell of the house throws me off.  The wonderful smell of the shore is confusing my senses as it's used to accepting this scent as \"Summer Smell.\"  The house is cold, which is also alarming, as we're usually complaining about the heat.  \n\nI tell my folks I'm going for a walk on the beach.  I take my walkman, and my current favorite mix tape.  When I get to the beach, the wind is strong and steady, but not unbearable.  I walk towards the broken, abandoned pier that lies in the distance.  As I walk, I hear Enya cooing about something in Irish Gaelic.  At one point, looking at the milky sea pulsing on the tired sand, I pretend I'm in Ireland.  I look to the horizon, and wonder how many sharks are swimming, smelling the dark cold ocean for it's next meal.  \n\nAs I reach the pier, there's a jetty of huge jagged boulders that snake from the water onto the dry sand.  I find my way across these massive stones, until I find my seat of observation.  I sit, and stare at the deformed pier, and the grey ocean.  I think of my future, I wish for a girlfriend, and I imagine what my dinner shall be when I get home.  I look forward to playing board games with my folks and listening to Van Morrison while drinking blended margaritas, and I look for a shark's fin in the ocean.  Tell me something, ocean.

{"archived":true,"author":"golf4miami","body":"Jane's hot breath cut through the cool crisp air. The temperature was a perfect forty degrees. Just cool enough that she could see the air vapor as it left her mouth, but warm enough that she could still go on her morning run. Dressed in black leggings, a t-shirt, and a North Face jacket she looked like your typical female student runner. She had done this run hundreds of times in her collegiate career. The difference this time was that she could feel the cold polymer of her fathers Glock 19 tucked between her leggings and underwear and under her jacket. \n\nHer father had given her the gun and the money to go to the range to practice with it when she had started at the University of Cincinnati. According to some study he had either heard or read, the area around the campus here wasn't really the best place to be. Especially if you were a female and even more so if you liked to go running, on the same route, during the dark of the mornings. At first she had bristled at the idea of even having a gun in her possession, much less firing one. It wasn't that long after school began her freshman year and one of her friends was #BADWORDS#, after that her tone changed. As she was running she thought back to those days while *Demons* by Imagine Dragons blared in her ear buds.\n\nThe reports had started a few days ago. People who were by all accounts dead, miraculously recovering. One guy who was shot in the face with a shot gun was rushed to the hospital and when they arrived he became alert and had no pain. For some reason the shotgun blast had just knocked him out for a few minutes and that was it. The man was going to survive. When these reports started to come out at first people were skeptical, but then there were more. A whole bus load of children somehow survived after the bus was forced off of the side of a cliff by a drunk driver. Not even a scratch on any of them.\n\nIt wasn't very long after that people started outwardly tempting fate. One man jumped from the Golden Gate bridge only to be picked up by a boat 15 minutes later still alive. A jihadist in the middle east ran into a crowded shopping mall and detonated a suicide bomb and not only did everyone in the mall survive, but somehow so did he. The only differences between any of these experiences were that the manner of death by which you should have died seemed to determine how long you were knocked out for. It took that jihadist a few hours to recover, whereas it only took that jumper fifteen. \n\nUnfortunately for Jane this had just made the criminals around campus more anxious to commit crimes. They could shoot you in the head, take your money or #BADWORDS# you, and then walk away like nothing happened knowing that you'd just wake up in a few minutes. No police force had the man power necessary to try and track down all these crimes since no one had died, they were not a priority. She had hoped that whatever was going on was only temporary so she skipped running for a couple days in hopes that it would pass on it's own. It hadn't though and she *had* to go for a run today. About halfway through it was so far so good.\n\nWith about a quarter mile to go though, she saw some thugs ahead of her blocking off most of the sidewalk. There were three of them in total. All of them dressed in jeans that were sagging and about to fall off their asses and big black puffy coats. These coats are what made it really easy for them to hide any weapons. She was only about twenty steps away when she saw them start to reach for their back pockets. Instinctively so did she.\n\nShe was about ten steps away when one of the thugs pulled out their gun and aimed it at her sideways. Just as quickly she pulled out hers and squeezed off three rounds. Hitting the gun wielding thug in the throat and the other two in the chest. All three of them dropped like bags of sand to the ground and blood started pouring out of their bodies. A stream of red flowed down the sidewalk towards the bottom of the hill and Jane was fascinated by it. For some reason she felt an attraction to the blood, not unlike the attraction she had felt for Paul, her boyfriend, on they day they first met. \n\nShe stood their over their bodies for so long she didn't even realize that one of the thugs she had shot in the chest was beginning to wake up. Suddenly his hand was on her calf trying to pull her down. Thanking her father in her mind again for putting her through the training necessary she quickly aimed and got another round off. This time the bullet struck right between his eyes and he went down again. New, fresh blood poured from the wound she had just created. An excited tingly feeling that started in her finger tips moved through her body.\n\nQuickly she put two more bullets into the other thugs brains to ensure that they would not be waking up soon and be allowed to follow her. She placed the gun back in it's hiding spot and began to walk back toward her apartment. She had gained such a rush from the shooting that she didn't even feel the need to finish her run. As she was walking back she contemplated how good it had felt to blow the brains out of those thugs. It was a good stress reliever she decided and she resolved to find some thugs on every morning run after. Jane just hoped that after this strange phenomenon has ended, that she too would be able to stop her shooting spree.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390400698","downs":0,"edited":"1390405684","gilded":0,"id":"cevxkiz","link_id":"t3_1vudow","name":"t1_cevxkiz","parent_id":"t3_1vudow","retrieved_on":1432054054,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

He couldn't believe what he just saw, and yet, it was all happening, all so very real in front of his eyes. Jordan Miller was always a simple man. For 20 years, Jordan walked into his lab at 9am, hair combed and a medium black coffee in his hand, and left at 6pm to meet his loving wife, Natalie, and his one kid he was proud to have. He was happy that God blessed him with such a loving family, but somehow, it wasn't enough. As the energy of the implosion approached the ISS, Jordan remembered the one thing that brought him here, that brought him away from Earth, away from his family. \"Looking for 3 candidates to go aboard the ISS for minor repairs, contract period 4 months.  Training to be provided, heavy background in physics recommended.\" Jordan stared long and hard at the adverti#BADWORDS#t he saw in his morning paper, not sure what to make of it. He felt something, something he hadn't felt in what seemed to be decades. A sudden rush, a sense of warmth, a feeling of belonging. This was it, this is what felt right. Jordan always pondered as to why the ISS would put out such an adverti#BADWORDS#t in a newspaper, but calling it 'faith' seemed to do enough justice in Jordan's mind. Not much time now, things are starting to get hot. Jordan looks around the ISS, looks for something, looks for anything that would help him. His mind is drawing blanks. \"Think, think - What is the next step?\" Jordan thought to himself. The intensive and rigorous training he went through did not prepare for anything as close to a situation as this. A sheering pain then went through his body. Jordan wasn't sure what it was, but he was sure it wasn't from the after-math of the implosion. He had felt this pain before, and he knew many before had felt the same too. He then knew what it was, and as much as he tried to remind himself that it shouldn't be this painful, he couldn't do anything to block the emotion that was causing him this pain, regret. He heard her voice resonate in his head, and for a brief moment wished with all his might that she could be right next to him. \"It's only 4 months, honey. I'll be back before you know it. I'll be a hero. It'll be like nothing else.\" Jordan told a shaken Natalie, tears rolling down her cheeks. \"But what if you don't come back?\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390419285","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cew5nzg","link_id":"t3_1vv449","name":"t1_cew5nzg","parent_id":"t3_1vv449","retrieved_on":1432057910,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"IsItMe2","body":"“Jack” was his name.  At least that’s what his shirt said.  Of course it was a Wonder Bread delivery shirt from probably the 1950’s.  The tan fabric was faded and worn thin in the shoulders.  The s#BADWORDS#ching that held on the path was flawless however.  The craftsmanship was either quite fine or Jack had taken pride in keeping that portion of the shirt intact.  Jack looked to be in his 30’s so I doubt that was his job or his name.  When was the last time you saw a Wonder Bread Delivery truck anyway?\n\nI wanted to be alone, but Jack didn't look like the obnoxious talkative type.  The kind that believes sitting anywhere near is an invitation for them to tell you all about their recent trip to Boise and the time their Grandmother let them have ice cream for dinner.  I sat on the far end of the bench and gazed out over the water.  The calm breeze brought me the sharp sent of salt and crustaceans from farther down the docks.  Lapping waves and the occasional call of a gull covered the sounds of commerce and let the world fall away.  My thoughts drifted across the spectrum of my life.  Should I marry Jessica?  Am I in a dead-end job? Should I get a puppy? What would my life be like if WWIII started tomorrow?\n\nMy concentration broke as I became aware of Jack staring at me.  Hoping he was lost in though and looking through me not at me I ignored him and staunchly stared straight ahead.  My former focus through my mind’s eye was not squarely centered on my peripheral.  I did not want to look and engage him, but I couldn’t help but monitor if he was still looking at me.  To illustrate that I was paying him no mind I tore a piece of dead skin from my lower lip with my teeth and blew it from the tip of my tongue.  \n\n“My Husband left me”, Jack mumbled, his gaze still on me.\n\n“Yeah? Uh, sorry.” I replied as flatly as I could, no affect to suggest that I was interested and he should continue.\n\n“We just adopted our second child earlier this year.  Molly.  She’s three.”\n\nI turned my face toward him and feigned a sympathetic smile and nod hoping he would keep his thoughts in his own mind where they belong.\n\n“I don’t remember how to live without him…and now?  With two children…” He spoke from miles away.  \n\n“Perhaps if I acknowledge him for a few moments he’ll stop talking” I thought as I turned to look at Jack.  His eyes held the sorrow I expected from a man so overwhelmed he felt the need to pour out his troubles to a stranger, but the rest of his face was blank.  Likely it was shock that held his features slack and neutral with his eyes as the only outlet.  It occurred to me that his pupils were abnormally large; his iris was a mere corona to the void of his pupil.  It was as if we were in the corner of a dive bar, not sitting on a bench at mid-day.  \n\nJack held my gaze for a few moments before looking down at his hands in his lap.  “I’m sorry” he spoke softly as he began slowly stroking his left forearm.\n\n“Yeah” I looked back to the water, unburdening my mind again after Jack’s interruptions.  Time passed swiftly as I once again let my mind wander.  When my mind once again returned to the present Jack was gone.  A cell phone sat in his place on the bench, the image of a man’s forehead with a blue wall behind him on the screen.  A small triangle in the bottom left begged me to tap it.  \n\nThe camera angle slide down and Jack’s face filled the screen.  Once again he was staring at me with that slack face and eyes full of sorrow.  Seconds ticked by and he merely stared.  I thought about turning it off.\n\n“Justin?” He spoke finally, “I’m sorry, Justin.  I just can’t…”\n\nThe phone dropped from his hand landing so that half the image was dominated by the earth brown carpet.  On the right side of the image sat a little tow-headed girl playing with block.  From off camera Jack spoke again.\n\n“Daddy is gone.  He left us.”  The girl looked up, a look of confusion on her face.  It was obvious she knew her Daddy was upset but didn’t know why.  Jack reentered the frame from the left and sat down next to her.  He put her in his lap and wrapped her in a hug.  I could now here quit crying from Jack as he spoke into her silken hair.\n\n“I’ll never leave you and your brother, Molly.  I’d go crazy without you two.”  Jack stood and walked off camera again and I could hear a drawer open and close.  He returned again in the foreground filling ¾ of the image, slowly moving toward the girl before kneeling down.   \n\nHe leaned in close, tears running down his face. \"Sanity,\" he said as he tenderly inched the knife into her chest, \"is a luxury I cannot afford.\"\n\nI’m sure the girl screamed but I blocked it out.  I didn’t want to hear.  He sat for a moment still loosely holding the knife deep in the girl’s chest.  Jack withdrew the knife gingerly as if he didn’t want to hurt her.  He rose slowly and left the frame again.\n\n“Sam.  Come hug, Daddy.”\n\n(I'm not sure of the etiquette but feedback is welcome.

The papers were stacked high on her desk and it was already past nine but she turned and smiled. She sat down on her eager son's bed and told him about the fast current stream she used to play in as a child, but before she could finish describing the silver minnows, his droopy eyelids won over and his breathing steadied. She chuckled in spite of herself, pulled up his covers and planted a gentle kiss on his forehead before returning to her desk. \n\nYears later, she sat around the dinner table with her children and husband. Her son, now grown sat next to his newlywed wife. The wine flowed freely and silverware clattered. Along with the passing of the green beans and buns, came knowing looks and stifled laughter. During a lull in his father's boisterous story telling, the young man pushed back his chair and stood. \n\"I have an announcement,\" he proclaimed with the weight of a Ten Commandments speech. Strong and powerful, then he glanced over at his wife and his voice faltered. \"...we're having a baby.\" \nEveryone around the table cooed and fussed. The woman rose and went to her daughter-in-law. She wrapped her in a warm embrace and kissed her on the cheek. \"It's the best thing that'll ever happen to you,\" she whispered, tears in her eyes. \n\nThe woman was old now. She couldn't stand most days but she still enjoyed the company of her family. As the years raced by, the cookies and wooden blocks scattered on the floor were replaced by medical equipment and oxygen tanks. As her family gathered around her rocking chair, they all reached the mutual understanding that this would be the last time they would all be able to get together, as they came from so many different areas. Despite the somber mood in the room, the woman laughed. Everyone in the room looked up startled and immediately realized they had been looking down at their feet. The woman heaved herself up and opened her mouth. She stood there smiling, mouth gaping for a few moments and then simply said, \"Let's eat.\" Later as she looked around at the sleepy faces of her aging family, her son came up from behind her chair and kissed her on the cheek and she realized why she was happy. \n\n ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390459814","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cewo9rs","link_id":"t3_1vw8jh","name":"t1_cewo9rs","parent_id":"t3_1vw8jh","retrieved_on":1432067670,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Click, click, click.  \"Hey you still there,\" asked Jerry.  \"Yeah, yeah,\" she replied, \"Just worried about this. I'll talk to you later.\"\n\nA food service robot rolled nearby. Its lights blinked and the whine of servos and motors filled her office.  \"Hey, lunchbot, hey,\" she yelled, \"Over here!\"   The robot kept wheeling away, ignoring her.  She threw her pen at it, hit it, but it only continued to ignore her.  It rolled towards the stairs, slowed for a moment, and fell down the stairs with a series of loud clunks and high pitched beeps.\n\n\"What the hell is going on today,\" she said as she stood up and grabbed her coat.  Outside, the autocabs that usually pick up passengers sat there unmoving.  Police cars were pulled up next to them with officers quizzically scratched their heads.  Zevra turned around and walked back into the building.  Suddenly, she brought her head up and said, \"Oh I know!\" as she headed towards the ba#BADWORDS#t.\n\nShe stood in front of a dusty vending machine.  \"Okay this piece of crap has no intelligence in it,\" she said to herself and slowly shoved a dollar bill into it.  The machine spit out the dollar. She sighed. She tried again, \"Come on,\" she implored, \"Come on! Please!\"  The machine took the dollar with an unusually satisfying ding sound. Zevra jumped out and yelled, \"#BADWORDS#ay,\" selected the option for the granola bar, and munched on it as she walked back to her office.\n\nShe finished off the granola bar, threw the wrapper towards the garbage can, and narrowly missed. She smirked, \"Can't win em all, I guess,\" as she stared at the wrapper sitting next to the garbage can.  A moment later a sanitation bot rolled in. \"I'll get that for you ma'am,\" it pleasantly said as it reached for the wrapper, fell over, and knocked the garbage can's contents onto the floor. Zevra watched as its little wheels spun and it threw its little hands in the air comedically trying to latch onto something.  \n\nShe laughed, kicked the bot back up with her foot, shoo'd it out of her office, and went back to her spreadsheet.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390501131","downs":0,"edited":"1390515772","gilded":0,"id":"cewzpdv","link_id":"t3_1vxwdh","name":"t1_cewzpdv","parent_id":"t3_1vxwdh","retrieved_on":1432073505,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Rob_G","body":"I never go to bookstores. I never read books. I mean, I read, just not books, not physical books. It’s always either on my Kindle, or something on my phone. But, and I don’t even know why I was here, I think I had an hour or so to kill before my wife finished class, but I found myself downtown at this really cramped bookstore.\n\n“Can I help you with anything?” that was the lady behind the desk, which, it wasn’t even a desk, really, it was just another stack of books, only it didn’t go all the way up to the ceiling, so it looked like a desk. Nothing looked like anything. Every inch of wall space, it was just books. And there were milk crates on the floor overflowing with more books. It’s like, I could imagine people moving, changing apartments, they’ve cleaned out their closets, they have this really weird collection of old textbooks and random paperbacks.\n\n“See if you can sell it to the bookstore,” someone might say, and of course they’re not going to pay anything for it, I mean, if I owned a small bookstore, I mean really small, I mean this place, I was getting uncomfortable just standing inside, but if it was my shop, and some guys brought a crate of books, I’d just motion to the wall, “Leave them over there boys.” And they’d be like, “Well, is this stuff worth anything?” And I’d just repeat, “Over there, by the other milk crates.”\n\nIt’s like, could there be something valuable buried under all of those unused cookbooks and twenty-fifth edition Lord of the Rings trilogies? Maybe. Probably not. So when the lady asked me if I needed any help, I almost wanted to throw it right back at her, I wanted to be like, “Me? Do I need any help? Looks like you’re the one who needs some help, organizing these books, getting rid of that really old book smell.”\n\nOf course I wouldn’t say that, “Just browsing,” I told her. And I started browsing, in the fullest definition of the word. I couldn’t tell if the books in the bookcases were organized by author name or if there was some sort of a category in which everything was supposed to fall, but, I looked, I don’t think there was any system, it was just a bunch of books, wherever they fit, one book come out, grab another from the milk crate, one that fits really tight.\n\nI knew that my chances of finding something cool were pretty slim. There wasn’t really enough time to read the jacket covers of every book that I selected at random from the shelves. Mostly I was looking to kill some time, I nudged worn-out spines out from the collection and looked at the cover art. It’s interesting, most book covers, they fall into three categories: there are photographs, usually a memoir or a biography, there are cool artistic illustrations, these may or may not have something to do with whatever’s written inside.\n\nAnd then there are the covers that don’t mess around, a solid color with the #BADWORDS#le printed in bold text. *Don’t Put it Back* caught my eye not because of what was on it, but rather what wasn’t. It was a plain blue jacket, the copy itself looked maybe thirty years old or so, and the #BADWORDS#le was written in a very simple yellow Helvetica.\n\nIt drew me in. I flipped through the yellowed pages, opened at random to somewhere just past the middle. I started reading at a paragraph on the center of the left page:\n\n&gt; “Rob opened the book to a random spot and started reading. He still had twenty minutes or so until he was supposed to meet his wife, but that’s not a lot of time to be able to do anything, nothing meaningful, not really. Why was he in this old bookstore? He questioned his surroundings, but a background part of his mind calculated what it would feel like to be waiting somewhere else, outside, that would have been too cold, maybe for five minutes or so, but twenty, no, he would have started playing with his phone, gloves off, his fingers would be freezing. Starbucks? Coffee? Too crowded, he’d have to buy something. No, this was nice. Not nice, not exactly, but no pressure, he could just stand, look at stuff, maybe read something, he was always open to the long shot possibility that something might pop out, a good story. He’d buy it …”\n\nThis was crazy. This paragraph was describing exactly what I was doing at that very second, down to the thought process. It was absolutely uncanny. Like, my heart actually skipped a beat, like you notice someone staring at you from across a room, you think, is this for real? Is that person really staring at me? And you play it off like it’s not weird, like this is just another mundane moment, I can’t really compute such a dramatic turn of events.\n\nI put the book back. I thought, was this a joke? Like some sort of a hidden camera thing? They have shows like that, they’ll put unsuspecting people in weird situations and film the reactions. That kind of made sense. Were all of the books like this? All of the paragraphs identical? I started picking out other random books.\nThere was a random fiction collection, some nonfiction Civil War book, something with a painting of a seashell on the cover. I looked through all of them. Nothing. Regular words. I had to see the other book. Did it call me by name, Rob? What was the rest of the book about? But I couldn’t find it. It was right here but now I couldn’t find where I had slid it back.\n\n“Excuse me,” I think I startled the lady behind the book desk. “I was just reading this book, it was blue, I think it was called *Don’t Put it Back*. Do you know what I’m talking about?”\n\n“Well let’s see,” she stepped into the aisle and started looking at the #BADWORDS#les printed on the spines. “Do you know the author? Maybe I could look it up online.”\n\nThis wasn’t going to be any help. “No,” I said, “It was right here, I was just reading it.”\n\nShe could tell I was getting impatient. She said, “Well, maybe you shouldn’t of put it back,” adding extra emphasis on the last three words, like, haha, that was funny right?\n\nIt wasn’t funny. I needed to know what was in that book. But my wife called. She told me she was ready. I tried telling her what was going on but she was all, “Yeah, yeah, I’m freezing, let’s go.” And I had to go.\nI don’t even remember where that bookstore was. I was just wandering around. I went back a few days later and I swear, I couldn’t find it. It was crazy. Was that like the universe giving me a chance at some sort of important wisdom, something right there on the cover, Rob, don’t put this book back. And I’m just like, hold on, this is crazy. And I put it back.\n\nI put it right back. That sounds crazy, right?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390539775","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cexhu1l","link_id":"t3_1vxvts","name":"t1_cexhu1l","parent_id":"t3_1vxvts","retrieved_on":1432083124,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":8}

His eyes found his campaign manager in the audience and they exchanged a look of relief as Governor Sanderson stood up.\n\n\"Yea, I guess that sounds pretty good.  I think, yea, I mean, he totally has my vote.\"\n\nSomewhere in the back of the 10,000 person auditorium a man coughed.\n\n\"No seriously, ya'll should just vote for this guy.

{"archived":true,"author":"definitely_right","body":"Part 1/2\n\nI scrubbed the skillet with the rough side of the sponge quietly, the steaming water pouring from the faucet helping loosen the layer of grease that had been cooked onto the black surface of the metal. It was the last thing that needed cleaning before the evening was mine to relax at home, crack open a beer, and watch the Flyers game on TV. I vigorously cleaned off the last of the sticky grime from the dinner I’d cooked for myself, and once satisfied with its sanitation, I shut off the faucet, dried both the pan and my hands, and grabbed an Anchor Steam from the refrigerator before migrating into the tiny living room to begin my evening of peace.\n\nEven though I could have gotten away with it, I didn’t use the edge of the coffee table in front of me to pop open my drink. Andrea hated it when I did that. She wasn’t here right now—she was with her best friend Gillian, watching the season premiere of Dr. Who, a fixation I’d never shared with her—but I knew better than to do it anyway. She’d even been considerate enough to go out and buy me a little red bottle opener with the Marine Corps emblem on the handle, for me to keep in the drawer on the coffee table for that specific purpose. I couldn’t help but crack the smallest of smiles as I pulled the little thing out and popped the cap off my favorite beer, leaning back into my recliner and flipping on the television. The game had only just started, and I contentedly lifted the cool bottle to my lips for a sip of the amber liquid, the same brand of beer that Andrea had ordered on our very first date.\n\nIt still tasted the same. I smiled again.\n\nThe game was exciting; hockey was always exciting to me. I’d played it as a child, on the frozen lake down the road from my childhood home during the winter, with my brothers. They were much better than I was, but I learned quickly. I played it throughout middle school and even a little bit in high school. When I enlisted in the Corps I was initially harassed by my ability to skate, but my new brothers quickly let it go once they realized how talented I was. For years, though, during my service, I didn’t get an opportunity to skate. To play hockey, even if only for fun. It had pretty much left my life altogether.\n\nThen I got that extra week of leave.\n\nThe Flyers scored, and I let out a little whoop of my own as the stadium went nuts. I habitually glanced to my right, at the couch, and quickly returned my eyes to the screen, remembering that Andrea was not home. Still, I raised my bottle anyway, as if to touch glasses with her, and brought it to my lips again. \n\nWe’d tapped bottles together, too. On that first date. I didn’t remember what team was playing at that sports bar, but that didn’t really matter. Goals were goals, cheers were cheers. \n\nI drank the rest of my beer slowly. I didn’t even finish it until after third period had started and the Flyers scored another goal. I found myself only half-attached to the game; the other half of my attention was absorbed by the unoccupied space to my right. My usual hockey partner was not present. The opposing team scored one goal, then another, though, and then the game was tied up and the horn went off. Overtime it was, then. I glanced at the clock; 9:58. Maybe she would come home in time to catch the last few minutes with me before bed.\n\nI got up from my recliner and picked up the empty Anchor Steam, carrying it into our apartment’s tiny kitchen to recycle it. Andrea had a thing for recycling. She’d take trash bags full of all our empty bottles down to some facility twice a month and somehow come back with fifty dollars to put in our date jar. Another smile. Tomorrow was Monday night, our Date Jar Night.\n\nThe knock came next. \n\nIt was not Andrea’s knock, I could tell right off the bat. Hers was quiet, a simple triple-tap on the wood directly underneath the peep hole. This was two, forceful pounds of a fist, higher up on the door than what I was expecting. The commercials were playing on the television, so I figured I had time to answer the door and get back before overtime began, but I hesitated. \n\nIt was ten o’clock at night. Who the hell was there?\n\nI walked to the door, my bare feet somewhat cold on the chilled hardwood, and stopped to check the peep hole. But it was in vain; Andrea had hung a wreath for fall time over it on the front. I hesitated again, listening for any indication of who the person behind the door might be. Nothing.\n\nThe next set of pounds made me flinch pretty badly. They were harder, more urgent. They were also followed by words:\n\n“Open up.”\n\nThe voice was deep, obviously masculine, and unfriendly. Immediately my wariness increased. But the pounding continued. I double checked that the chain slide was latched before I unlocked the door and began to twist the handle, with the intent of opening it only an inch or two.\n\nSomething slammed into the door, pushing me back, and with a groan and a snap, the chain preventing the door from opening further broke into a dozen segments of the links, clattering on the floor like metallic rain. My stomach dropped and a shiver of panic wound its way straight into my chest; I could feel my heart throbbing in my ribcage.\n\nThe door opened in its entirety to reveal a large, dark-skinned man, dressed in all black garments with a gray backpack and a very black revolver in his hand. \n\nI was too shocked to say anything. To even move. I just stood there, mouth half open, staring at the robber who stared back at me. Stared with brown eyes looking at me from a ski mask.\n\nThen the revolver was pointed directly at my chest, and the man had taken the two steps necessary to put himself inside my apartment and press the barrel against my pajama shirt. With his free hand, he closed the door rather forcefully behind him. The weapon did alarm me, but I did not panic. I was a Marine. Marines do not panic when faced with these situations.\n\nThe man removed his gray backpack with the empty hand and #BADWORDS# it against my chest, which I raised my hands up and clenched, still maintaining eye contact with him. The silence between us persisted, and in the background I could hear that the game had come back on. Andrea flashed through my head. I briefly wondered if she would be mad at me if I died here tonight.\n\n“Money, phones, jewelry. In here. Now.” \n\nHis demands were simple. Curt. Forceful. He did not use profanity, or raise his voice, like I expected him to. He just pressed the barrel a little harder against my shirt. I let out a shaky exhale as he released the backpack into my grip and slowly turned around to comply with him.\n\nWith every step I took away from the man I wondered if there was any chance I could get to it. Get to the pistol in my nightstand. I decided against it rather quickly as I heard the robber’s footsteps following me. I went into the kitchen and retrieved my iPhone, wallet, and a pair of Andrea’s earrings she’d left on the counter, stuffing them all into the backpack numbly. Ideas played out in my mind. The knives in the drawer. The vase in the living room. The lamp in the hallway. Nothing would work.\n\nThere was no dialogue between us as we went from room to room, slowly, clearing any valuables that could fit inside the robber’s gray backpack. I moved without emotion. I knew, of course, that adrenaline was surging through me—my heart was on rapid fire, sweat was pouring down my neck and forehead, my airways were constricted—but the actual feeling of raw terror was not present. Perhaps there was a way I could get out of this alive. \n\nWe made the final turn from the short hallway into our bedroom. It was dark. The robber immediately turned on the light. It was a clean room, just how Andrea liked it, so none of her belongings were immediately apparent to the robber. I directed him first to my dresser, pulling out various watches and sunglasses, and my tablet, all which the man indicated I deposit into the backpack. I did without a word. Briefly, I glanced at my nightstand, again considering the weapon inside, but decided against it. I turned to guide him back out of the room, potentially away from Andrea’s dresser, which I knew contained rings and necklaces her grandmother had bequeathed to her before her passing, but the man could tell that a woman shared this room with me and stopped me, pressing the gun into my back, between my shoulder blades.\n\n“The jewelry,” he hissed quietly. A sense of disappointment and failure crept into me, but I subdued it and reluctantly opened her drawer, emptying its contents into the backpack with the rest of the valuables. I turned and looked at the thief, hoping to convey that there were no more valuables in the house, when we both jumped slightly at the noise.\n\nThree, timid raps on the front door.\n\nJust like the first time she showed up at my apartment, my heart contracted painfully in my chest. But the pain was not of excitement or enthusiasm.\n\nThis was the agony of fear.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390851182","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cf0996g","link_id":"t3_1w8p9p","name":"t1_cf0996g","parent_id":"t3_1w8p9p","retrieved_on":1435515553,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Happehh","body":"Being one of the first astronauts on Mars was a dream for James, as a child he would replay the first moments on the moon in his memory, replacing Neil with his own face. It made him laugh looking back now that he was strolling around on Mars' surface. He had landed a few days earlier and had already explored around 100ft from his ship with Jenny, Brook and Matt, but had been halted by the usual checks Houston forces... but now was his chance. \n\nEscaping the hollow, metal shell of the ship James wandered outside. He decided to head East this time, towards the large canyon he saw upon entry. Seeing only a glimpse, he noticed several holes and it peaked his curiosity. \"It was better than the flat terrain every where else anyway\" he thought to himself.\n\n\"James!\"\n\nJames knew that voice from the last 13 months of training, and it always put a smile on his face, though he could never show this affection to her. \"Jenny!\" he shouted back.\n\n\"Where are you heading? We still need to finish doing our visual and internal checks.\" Jenny was always uptight about things being perfect, I guess that was a good trait with her job being the Engineer. This time though, James outranked her and this put a sly smile on his face. Jenny's expression became confused, \"What..?\"\n\n\"Being the Commander on this mission, I'm calling rank, go ahead and do those checks with Brook. I just need some fresh air.\" He saw Jenny try to argue but he had already turned around and began walking away laughing loudly at his own joke. Something Jenny was unfortunately used to. \n\nThe walk to the canyon was easy enough for James. The lowered gravity helped and after a few dozen hops, he had reached his destination. The canyon was still visibly dark inside and it felt anything would come out at any time. Just thinking about it gave James the creeps. He decided he should probably stop watching Alien films before missions from now on. Slowly James began walking to the edge of the canyon, each step became more and more treacherous, he had not become accustomed to the difference in gravity yet. Scuttling to the edge, he reconfirmed what he saw on the opposite side, holes. Not just any holes either, ones that had been carved into arches leading deep into the wall. These were not natural either as the arches were too perfect and he noted small carvings on them. As James began thinking how they got there, and more importantly, what put them there he began to feel a presence behind him. It took him a few seconds to fully grasp the idea that something was truly behind him, but when he did, a natural reaction occurred and he quickly turned around. What he found in front of him was a large figure towering above him, face covered by shadow and two silhouettes coming from its back. Time slowed down for what felt like minutes while James was taking in what he saw, but only seconds had passed. James, as another natural reaction kicked in, jumped back and fell...\n\n\n***Will continue tomorrow, late and tired for now.*** \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390870210","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cf0ij68","link_id":"t3_1wafgl","name":"t1_cf0ij68","parent_id":"t3_1wafgl","retrieved_on":1432135861,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}

His steps are slow, stumbling, for he sinks as if trying to walk in fine, shifting sand, but it is not sand underfoot, but ashes; an endless plain of ashes, broken only by charred bones and ruined buildings. Even the wind has died, and the silence is filled only by the gentle rustle of ash shifting against boot and ash.\n\nAnd yet, the man moves ever onwards, restless, inexorably drawn towards some far-off fate, and he does so without fear. But his long journey is at an end. He crests an ashen hill, pauses, then walks down, on his last step falling onto his knees, and from them onto his hands, prostrating himself with great respect. \"Teacher.\" He says, his voice #BADWORDS#led.\n\nThe man sitting cross-legged regards with carefully, great age and wisdom carved into his features. “You are late.” He says, sternly, but without scorn. There are no apologies. “Are you ready, then?”\n\nThe wanderer hesitates. “I… I do not know.” He says, straightening up. He reaches up to remove his mask and blinks against the stinging air. The man-- no, a boy still, his face fresh and innocent -- then turns his eyes to his teacher again, with an expression of concern. “I wish I had more time.”\n\nTo the great surprise of both, the old man lets out a single bark of laughter. “That, child, may well have been the last wish of every man that has ever lived.” The amu#BADWORDS#t drains from his expression, leaving behind a content neutrality. “I have taught you all that opportunity allowed. The rest is in your hands.”\n\nThe boy, however, is unconvinced. “But what if I make mistakes?” He asks, hands pleading, but falls silent as his teacher gestures sharply.\n\n“Then you will work to fix them, and when it is your time, you will teach about them, as I have taught you.” He says calmly, with certainty. “Do you think I did not make mistakes I would have rather avoided? Do you think those that came before me?” He asks, and watches the boy. But to this, he has no answer. “So I ask again. Are you ready, child?”\n\n“Yes.” He says, blinking away the stinging tears. He stands up, as if shouldering a great burden. The mask that once protected him falls from his hand and sinks in the ash, no longer needed, never to be found. “I am ready, teacher. As ready as I will ever be.”\n\n“Good.” The old man says, his eyes filling with tears. “Good.” He repeats, and sits up straighter, pride swelling in his chest. “You may begin.”\n\nAnd the boy turns his face to the dead sky, and lifts up his arms, and takes a breath.\n\nAnd he speaks-- no. He yells. Shouts. Commands.\n\nHe commands, “LET THERE BE LIGHT!” And there is.\n\n-027","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1390924373","downs":0,"edited":"1390939783","gilded":0,"id":"cf0yoxs","link_id":"t3_1watte","name":"t1_cf0yoxs","parent_id":"t3_1watte","retrieved_on":1432143947,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Or rather, they had known each other's voices. They could discern each other's wavelengths and speech patterns faster than they knew their own heart beats even though they were on opposite sides of the galaxy, linked together only by human technology and physics. Their hands had never touched, their eyes had never met, and yet both Mai and Gideon knew without a shadow of a doubt that there was a special place in this universe for just the two of them.\n\nThat place was Themis. A planet recently named by the starfleet, discovered a few short years before Mai and Gideon were born. The planet where both Mai and Gideon were destined to meet. \n\nThey had begun their journey from two different galaxies. Millions of light years apart. They first began speaking through the Hive, a digital frontier where humans could gather and communicate throughout the universe. Their avatars had changed much over the years, just as they had in reality. No matter what happened in their separate parts of the universe, Mai always could discern Gideon's voice on the web, and vice versa. Even if months or years had passed since being able to communicate. \n\nToday, after twenty years of hurdling through space at light speeds, Mai's ship was landing on Themis. Gideon's had landed a week before. For the first time, they would be on the same planet, in the same galaxy, under the same stars. Now that humanity had found this planet,  breathed new life into it, Mai hoped the same would happen for her. \n\nShe practically jumped off the last step disconnecting her from the ship she had called home her whole life to this new world. She had never placed a foot on solid ground before. She enjoyed running on it. But that was hardly what concerned her at the moment. \n\nShe ran into the crowd, leaving her parents yelling at her to take her suitcase. If she heard them she didn't acknowledge it. \n\nGetting through the barricade and throngs of people, asking where the town gardens are, she was pointed in the right direction. Her pace brisk, her heart pounding, she made it to the gardens and looked around hurriedly. \n\nScanning the area, she saw no one familiar. Then in the corner of her eye, she caught a glare and followed its direction. \n\nShe went around a hedge, found herself inside of a well-groomed maze, heard footsteps. She continued going after them, trying to catch up with the person creating that long stride. She was chasing him, running out of breath, wen suddenly she was in a small clearing full of exotic flowers she had never seen or smelled before. Standing in the middle, bearing herself in anticipation to have this man turn around so she could at last gaze upon his face. She couldn't even be sure it was him until he spoke. \n\n\"Hello, Mai.\"\n\n\"How did you know it was me?\"\n\nShe examined him. He was tall, lean, dark hair with bright green eyes. \n\n\"Because you were the only one in the garden that looked to be on a mission.\"\n\nHe watched her lithe body move quickly towards him. Her jet black, angular bob swaying in the wind. He smirked at the unique fashion sense of  women from her side of the galaxy.\n\nWithout needing any words, they closed the gap between them and his lips greeted hers. Twenty years he had waited, since the time he was a child, barely able to count to ten, and finally she was here, in his arms. Her skin was soft everywhere he touched. Her arms clasped tightly around his neck. \n\nHe traced her neck with kisses, she pulled the zipper at the top of his shirt down to reveal his collarbone and placed a hand upon it. He pinned her against a wall covered in ivy and held her there. Breathing her in. \n\n\"I love you, you know that though.\" His voice rang clearly. He kissed her hand lovingly, caressed the inside of her wrist. \n\n\"We got a bit carried away.\" She said, smiling.\n\n\"Now we have all the time in the world. I want to make love to you, and I will.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nHe took her hand and they walked back out of the clearing in the maze just as another young man and woman were entering. Mai and Gideon laughed and they both ran, holding hands, eyes meeting, finding their way out of the maze as partners.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1391017786","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cf1xjet","link_id":"t3_1wg247","name":"t1_cf1xjet","parent_id":"t3_1wg247","retrieved_on":1432161166,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

{"archived":true,"author":"bobthewraith","body":"**TELCORE INDUSTRIES Q4 EARNINGS DOWN 43%, MASSIVE LAYOFFS FEARED**\n\n*January 16, 2014 - New York -*  In a press conference yes#BADWORDS#ay at the company's Manhattan headquarters, Telcore Industries (NYSE: EHOH) CEO Dave Thompson announced the tubbytronics giant's Q4 2013 profits dropped 43% compared to the previous year. Even though analysts were already expecting Telcore's results to be disappointing given difficulties in the industry, many were caught off guard by the unexpectedly sharp drop. A leaked internal memo issued to Telcore's Human Resources Department also hints that layoffs affecting over 15% of the company's workforce will be implemented within the next six weeks, further plunging the company's future into doubt.\n\nThis marks a low point for Telcore, *Fortune's* \"Most Innovative Company in America\" for six straight years from 2006-2011. Founded by Thompson in 2004, Telcore quickly rose to industry dominance by building a vertically integrated worldwide tubbytronics empire. By acquiring Erik Prince's Blackwater Worldwide and also hiring Ron Johnson, pioneer of the Apple Store, Thompson managed to integrate his core competency of electronics manufacturing with parts procurement and consumer retail.\n\nHowever, business a#BADWORDS#en could not fend off broader political and social trends that have come to batter the tubbytronics industry. Starting with the August 2012 Nottingham Forest Bombings, pro-Teletubby groups like PETT (People for the Ethical Treatment of Teletubbies) have destroyed dozens of Telcore facilities and wreaked havoc upon its global supply chain. Meanwhile, pressure from lobbying organizations like the K-Street Teletubby Fund has slowly turned tubbytronics into a regulatory nightmare; just two months ago Congress passed the Teletubby Procurement Mitigation Act of 2013, mirroring an earlier EU law that puts strict quotas on Teletubby procurement.\n\nHowever, analysts universally agree that Telcore's greatest challenge is rapidly declining worldwide Teletubby stock. A recent report from the World Bank shows that Teletubby populations are at a 2,300 year low, and at current rates of procurement Teletubbies will go extinct within 7.25 years.\n\n\"Unless Telcore branches out to other parts sources or industries, it may not exist at the end of this decade,\" said Jonathan Goldstein, a Senior Partner at McKinsey's research arm. \"A massive paradigm shift is required; the alternative is that Telcore becomes irrelevant.\"\n\nDespite analysts' disappointing outlooks and massive industry troubles, CEO Thompson remains upbeat about his company's prospects.\n\nSaid Thompson, \"Our industry offers us many challenges, and we are immensely privileged to be able to take those challenges head-on and solve them. We here at Telcore are committed to success - our track record of innovation shows that we have what it takes to surmount massive obstacles in order to carry our commitments through to another day.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1391578695","downs":0,"edited":"1391581566","gilded":0,"id":"cf7fxo8","link_id":"t3_1x17o6","name":"t1_cf7fxo8","parent_id":"t3_1x17o6","retrieved_on":1432258979,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

Parents were dragging their children home after a long summer day of playing. While Marcus enjoyed being out in the sun, and no longer minded being around other people, her favorite time at the park was sunset. A lake sat back a ways behind the playground, docks, slides, and diving platforms built around the edge. Marcus often went there alone at sunset to sit, think, and remember her Pair.\n\nMarcus found it increasingly more difficult to get down to the lake - age was catching up to her pretty quickly. She still stumbled her way down the path, though, holding tightly to the hand of the woman following her. It was the first time in over thirty years she had brought someone with her to the lake at sunset.\n\n\"Marcus, slow down,\" the woman said, breathing heavily. \"We're old, stop acting like you're 20 again.\"\n\n\"If we don't hurry, we'll miss it! I've been waiting so long to show this to you, Taylor!\"\n\nTaylor sighed, but kept up with Marcus the rest of the way down the path. She hardly even noticed the lake until she sat on a bench to catch her breath. Marcus sat next to her, and it was almost as if the bench had been molded to fit her frame.\n\n\"How often did you come out here?\" Taylor asked, staring out at the orange-red reflection on the water.

He then writes my social security number, bank, address, DOB, parents names, my wife and children's names- and at the time I didn't even have a girlfriend, let alone know who my wife was. I suddenly feel an object #BADWORDS# in my side with considerable pressure and don't know what it was- I looked and it was some type of gun I've never seen before. \n\nI looked at him with a thousand yard stare and he writes on the pad for me to get off the train at the next stop. I cautiously get off and follow this man down the platform. He sits down and takes off his hat and hood. He looks very similar to me. He writes down on the legal pad again \"I am going to pull out my wallet to verify my iden#BADWORDS#y do not be alarmed\". \n\nHe pulls out his wallet and hands me a solid metal card and instructs me to put my thumb in the box on the back of the card. The card displays a hologram \"Iden#BADWORDS#y verified: Jack Manning\" and has a picture of the man.\n\nI'm in shock, how does this man have my name and why does he have this card? Is he CIA, FBI, or NSA?\n\nThe man grabs my hand and says \n\n\"Jack, I am you 30 years from now, in this briefcase is everything you need to know for your life until then, if you're still unsatisfied in 2044 you can come back and try again, you've done this twice before\"\n\nThe man then disappeared in the blink of an eye. \n\nIt's been now two years since that encounter.\n\nI still have the briefcase sitting next to my bed, unopened.    \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1391701558","downs":0,"edited":"1391701753","gilded":0,"id":"cf8k5vk","link_id":"t3_1x67wk","name":"t1_cf8k5vk","parent_id":"t3_1x67wk","retrieved_on":1432280259,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"noobicide61","body":"He finds her laying there. In a congealed mass of all of the things he has lost over his years, and the one thing he thinks is why did he hadn’t expect this sooner.  Their relationship had long since grown into something that used to would have been called unhealthy when there was other to determine these things. He holds on to a clutch of her hair with the grip of a rotten apple in hands of someone starving who knows they will be apple to eat it.\n\tThere was a reason he found one named Eve. He had the time; he just kept waiting, and waiting. There was a special kind of girl that was so broken that she would come to him. She mustn’t have any family or friends. He offered her a part of his secret. He had told that he had the technology to make her face useful for all eternity. He explained like a garbage man, like a doctor, like a politician, like all the jobs he’s had over the span of forever how exactly the body breaks down, corrupts itself, and how to prevent it. He brought her down into his fortress and showed her the room with the cyan lights explaining how many times he had tried freezing the dead ones before he realized that the secret was to prevent dying all together. He showed her monkeys and mice that were older than her countries. Held one gerbil in particular with the name Steve and she could only think that no one has been named that since the fall of the American Empire. \n\n“Why don’t you show this to the world?” she had asked finally. “And what will you do to me?”\nHe showed her the monthly pills, shots, and vitamins she would be taking. He then told her:\n“I’ve tried. They don’t want my disease.” \n\nAll of that happened long ago when was a mere baby. It was before she had seen every country and the ones that came after those. It was before she knew the metallic, radioactive taste of modern civil war. It was before she had watched mountains fall into the see or stars in nearby galaxies go supernova. Finally, it was before she had stopped taking her pills. He knew what she had done when the wrinkles started, and her hair got just a few grays. He had tried to ask her nicely to stay with me. He told her it’s a constantly dying world out there, and that she wouldn’t live a year without me. She had laughed and told me that was the point. \n\nThat was when he begun to lock her up in chains. He begun the force feeding, until years later she stopped fighting as she saw the lasts of the earth die. He let her free once he could say with certainty that she was his everything, and that without him she would have nothing. And for years she accepted that, and for years they worked on their space ship hoping that flying that could take them back to a place with voices. For a while she accepted this, until today he found her hanging on her former chains. \n\nSlowly, he unchained each link. He held her in his arms like a pieta carrying back to the place he found her. He uncovered the rumble and dust and ash to dig a small square hole. He slowly lowered her to join the rest of her kind before returning home. From there, for a while, he watched the water and wind collect the traces of us back in the ocean. Finally, he packed a small bag with only a small lamp and food for Steve. Then started his space ship directed nowhere in particular and begun drifting. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1391883691","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cfab2ho","link_id":"t3_1xclrh","name":"t1_cfab2ho","parent_id":"t3_1xclrh","retrieved_on":1435501873,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"Koyoteelaughter","body":"I've seen her before. The girl in that picture. I've seen her before this prompt was posted. Her name was . . . Coralee. I think. I think her name was Coralee. Why did you post that picture? She's been dead for years; nearly sixty in fact.\n\nWhere did you find it? I mean, it's probably some stock photo you found on the internet, but I'm curious. Me and my family used to visit a farm down south of the Missouri/Arkansas line. There were three of us plus our parents. I know that picture. I used to lie in bed staring up at it, trying to fall asleep. The picture was creepy, but no where near as creepy as the story my grandfather used to tell with regards to how she died.\n\nCan you imagine that? Twelve year old me, laying in an old bed that smelled of old people and moth balls. Thick handmade blankets my grandmother s#BADWORDS#ched in her sewing circle were d#BADWORDS# across me and layered several blankets thick as if to protect me from the next ice age. A space heater hissed near the door, popping and sparking as errant particles of dust and foolish insects made contact with the electric filaments heating the room. And, her face was always staring.\n\nGrandfather used to come in and sit beside me. On one level, I think he was just trying to put my mind at ease, but on a different level, I think he'd siphoned gasoline from one to many gas tanks. He had a heightened way about him. One moment he was a broken down farmer scratching itches in disgusting places in full view of anyone foolish enough not to look away, in other moments he was feverish telling me tales of Coralee and of the men who stole her.\n\nArkansas, in the area where he lived, was a lot like the Hatfield and McCoys with their weeping hats, ill-fitting stained and patched clothing, and ramshackle cabins built of blued logs and split-shingle roofs. It was repressed, and at the time his story took place, the county had only a single sheriff to police it and two part-time deputies. \n\nIt was a land dispute. Coralee's father, my grandfather's brother, had been the recipient of a gift of land from his wife's late father. In his will, he'd bequeathed ninety acres of land, a dilapidated cabin, and a simple barn to him. Clyde Davies, my grandfather's brother, had a single solitary child. Her name was Coralee. Shaw Eggert was a cruel man. He had bought land off Clyde's father-in-law, a man named Hustus Levings, several times. At the time of Hustus's death, Shaw had been courting Hustus with offers for the ninety acres. Hustus had been adamant in his refusal.\n\nAfter the old man's death and Clyde's *inheritance*, Shaw con#BADWORDS#d the the will claiming the land was his and even scrounged up a bill of sale for the property. It was a different time according to grandpa. People still rode everywhere in the back of pickups, and there were horse and buggies being driven by people who weren't Amish. Shaw's claim was being given credence. The judge who presided in that county was on a circuit. He only heard cases when he was in town and it was two and sometimes three weeks before his circuit brought him to the county seat where the land resided.\n\nAs I said, gramps said Shaw was a mean cuss. He didn't want to wait. He resorted to the way things were typically handled around those parts. He stole something Clyde would miss and ransomed it for the deed to the property. It was Coralee, the girl in the picture you posted for this prompt. Usually, the ransoming entailed taking cattle or horses or farm equipment. Shaw knew what Clyde valued, and he took her. Him and two of his cousins came a calling around midnight in the spring of that year.\n\nAccording to grandpa, the rains were falling heavy during that season. Tor#BADWORDS#os were ripping up the forest across the state, lighting was falling from the sky in curtains of fire, and the rivers were up. Shaw worked Clyde over with the handle of a pickaxe, or a hillbilly broadsword as grandfather called it. Shaw's cousins took Coralee away, screaming and crying for her daddy. Grandfather told it, telling that even after taking the whoopin' Shaw threw him, the man still tried to crawl after the kidnappers. Shaw broke his jaw for this show of defiance. He gave Shaw a choice, bring the deed by midnight the next day or say goodbye to Coralee.\n\nYou know, it wasn't the grainy aspect of that photo that creeped me out about the picture. It was grandpa's retelling. Clyde had the sheriff and the sheriff's deputies over at Shaw's by midmorning the next day. They searched the farm, and the sheriff even threatened to take Shaw in, but his cousins vouched for him, claiming he'd been home all night the night before. The sheriff had no choice but to believe them. It was a different time.\n\nGrandfather still doesn't know why Clyde didn't just hand over the deed. He loved his daughter well enough, but in the heat of emotion, men do stupid things. Clyde went for his daughter instead, and he went with a twelve gauge. Gramps said the lighting was like a strobe light that night, flashing so often it looked more like day than night. Clyde shot one of Shaw's cousins in the stomach with the shotgun. The other? He shot in the thigh. He had only meant to wound him according to gramps. Evidently, being shot in the leg is a little more serious than television makes it seem. There's an artery there that if nicked or cut will cause a man to bleed to death in a matter of seconds. Clyde's shotgun cut that artery. Shaw's cousins were dead three minutes after Clyde arrived to demand his daughter back--his sweet Coralee.\n\nHe didn't shoot Shaw. Shaw agreed to give back his daughter. There's moments when men, cruel or kind, try to be clever and realize to late they're as stupid as a stump. Shaw had one of those moments. He'd dropped Coralee in a burlap sack, gagged her, and lowered her halfway down the well so the sheriff wouldn't find her. It was cruel, but clever under normal conditions. But, the creeks were up. It'd been raining off and on for almost three weeks. In a dry season, Coralee would have lived, but it wasn't the dry season, and the creeks *were* up. The entire water table had been steadily rising for twenty-one days.\n\nGrandpa said afterwards--after he'd talked to his brother in prison--that Clyde almost felt sorry for Shaw when he saw that burlap sack three feet under the surface of the water. The well had filled up from all the run off and the rising water table. Clyde had almost understood the mistake, but it was his Coralee in the bag--cold, terrified, and blue. He didn't shoot Shaw though. When the sheriff came back the next day with more men, they found Shaw nailed to the barn door still alive with Clyde slowly cutting parts off of him. It was the sheriff who shot Shaw, but not for the crime he committed. He did it to put the cruel bas#BADWORDS# out of his misery.\n\nClyde died in prison. Grandpa, when he was in his heigtened moments, told me that Shaws property had gone back to the county after his death, and he'd bought it. He said he'd burned Shaw's cabin to the ground along with the barn and all his outbuildings. he'd even filled in the well where Coralee had died.\n\nI don't know if any of this is true. I figured it was just gramps trying to get my goat. He told me that it was his fault the picture scared me seeing as how he'd built his cabin over the old well. He used to tell me that if Coralee's picture looked like it was starring at me, then she probably was. He said she'd probably managed finally to crawl up out the well. It's probably not true, but look at that picture. Tell me that after hearing this, you could sleep in a room at twelve years old with that picture hanging over your bed and with the fear that there really was a well beneath your bed.\n\nWhere did you find that picture?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1392537040","downs":0,"edited":"1392560723","gilded":0,"id":"cfgkgug","link_id":"t3_1y1e48","name":"t1_cfgkgug","parent_id":"t3_1y1e48","retrieved_on":1432418999,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

All radio stations are static, so we're not even sure if any other military still stand. We're not even sure if another human still stands. It's just twenty of us in this lab, only five knowing how to use weaponry. Like I said before, still nothing on the counter-weapon, maybe tomorrow may be different. Johnson reporting out\n\nDay 298. \n\nI was *dead* wrong. No, I was right. It was different, but now the way I #BADWORDS# expected. . .they attacked us. They're *in* the lab. The damn white beasts. They killed Lizzie, just dropped through an air vent and crushed her. We opened fire at the beast, and slowly watched the green blood ooze out. \n\nThen we heard the screaming from the lab. We all rushed towards it, wondering in frustration and anger of how they found us. We made it into the lab and saw hell. Fridges. They were attacking all the scientists. Either eating them or crushing them. We all sprayed bullets in the room. We didn't care who the hell we hit, we just wanted to be safe. Some bullets bounced off the fridges and came right back at us. I got hit in my left leg, and immediately fell to the ground. Chad began dragging me back to the barracks through the hellstorm. He settled me down in the closest dorm, and barricaded the door with the bed. \n\nWe heard gunshots for the next hour, which were usually followed by screams. Eventually, the noises died down and we both knew everyone was dead. I had already applied bandages to the shot wound, so I was pretty good now. Chad on the other hand seemed to be in bad shape. Probably due to Lizzie's death, or everyone's death for that matter. It was all silent, until we heard slight movement from the air vents. I had dropped my rifle back in the lab, so I pulled out my pistol and got ready. \n\nA fridge dropped out of the ceiling, and landed beside Chad. This shiny silver fridge opened up its door quickly, and a giant red tongue slithered out. It wrapped around Chad several times, before pulling him inside. The fridge door closed, and I could hear the poor bas#BADWORDS#'s #BADWORDS#led screams. The fridge turned to me, and began to wobble towards me. \nI raised up my pistol and began taking shots. I had emptied my clip into the #BADWORDS#, yet it was still coming. \n\nThis #BADWORDS# didn't want to kill me so easily. It dropped itself down on my legs, instantly breaking them. I pulled out my knife, and began stabbing the backside of the fridge. I only stopped once the fridge stopped shifting. \n\nNow here I am, speaking into his recorder. I can hear the #BADWORDS#s moving through the vents. They're watching me. No one will ever hear this. Humanity dies today. Johnson reporting out, for the last time.

{"archived":true,"author":"swimmingdropkick","body":"\"Do you know who rules this kingdom?\" \n\"Yes grandpapa, the Thunder Gods.\" Shina's eyes were wide as she engaged in conversation with her grandfather. Being one so young she was always fascinated by the history and myths of the land she lived in. Luckily her grandpapa was a man who could always answer her questions. As a scholar at the university reading and writing were his life. *(A fair amount of people in the city were literate, but access to literature was always difficult in a preindustrial realm.) \n\"No my darling, the Thunder gods do not rule the kingdom, they protect it. The royal family rules the city.\" Abmumal was delighted to have this conversation with his beloved granddaughter. He believed that she had just the right mixture of curiosity and courage to be a great leader or scholar. \n\"But grandpapa, I though the Thunder gods were the strongest beings in all of the realm. They live above the royal family.\" Her voice was exasperated as she pointed her little 8 year finger towards the looming structure at the southern end of the city.\n\n\"Remember Shina, he capital city of Tuphanu rests at the western tip of the kingdom ruled by the Royal family. The city carved from the granite and slate from the mountains that surrounds it is the gatekeeper of the kingdom. At the gate, the only entrance to the kingdom, not by river or over the mounts stands the Hall of storms. Not only does the Hall of storms serve as the castle defending the gates of the city and the kingdom, but also as the center of all royal, city and religious business. \nThis is because of who we are. We are the people of the storm kingdom. Long ago, nestled between the mountains, the great clouds clashed and collided, as they so often do and the first rain fell. At first the rain began to full up the kingdom reaching the tops of the mountains. The great clouds, while fierce rivals, often fighting each other for dominance of the sky did not want the rain, to take over the sky. So the clouds made an alliance to create new children to manage the unruly rain. Thus lightning was born to strike at the sea that filled the kingdom. Then the clouds parted and began to let the sun shine through. When the sunlight hit the spots where the lightning struck men sprung from the ground. That is where our people come, we are children of the sky. Our creators are the lightning and sun that gave us energy.\" Abmumal felt that this was a fair answer. \n\n\"But grandpapa, what about the Thunder gods? Are they just like us.\" Shina was happy for such a a story but still wanted to know the answer to her question. \n\n\"When our people sprang from the lightning and sunlight they went to work managing the rain. Our people set out working the land of the kingdom and thus when rain fell, it no longer grew skyward, but went to the earth to give us good crops and water to drink. Our people gave the rain a purpose and that is how the kingdom was formed. From there our people continued to grow and soon the clouds rewarded us for taming the rain by blessing us with cities. After we had been given cities we were given a royal family, anointed by the storm clouds. For a time all was well in the kingdom, until other came. They came from the east where it does not rain much, and they came with weapons. These invaders were not like us and desired to conquer us. They had conquered this city for a short time and was preparing to invade the whole kingdom. That is when the clouds blessed us with the Thunder gods. They were two men, anointed by lightning and through this blessing they gained the power far greater than any others. These two beings, harnessing the power of thunder, saved the kingdom. Afterward the our city was restored to the Royal family and the Hall of Storms was built along with the great walls to protect the kingdom. At the top of the Hall, is the Royal residence, and above that, the highest point in the kingdom, outside of the great mountains is the home of the Thunder gods. They were appointed by the sky to protect our people and so they lived so high up so they could always be close to the clouds.\" \n\nAbmumal was sure this answer would satisfy Shina, yet he was delighted when she responded with \"so do the Thunder gods ever die?\"\n\n\"Yes, Shina they do. When a Thunder god dies, a great storm will happen that night and a person will be anointed by the lightning. That person will be reborn as a Thunder god. And to answer your next question, there are only ever 2 Thunder gods at any time.\"\n\n\"Grandpapa I want to be a Thunder god.\" Her eyes were wide with excitement and full of dreams as she said this. \n\n\"Well I think you would be a fine Thunder goddess.\" He couldn't help but smile at her resolve and ambition. Little did he know that he was speaking to the perhaps the most important Thunder goddess ever to come.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1392666035","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cfhnwrz","link_id":"t3_1y5gto","name":"t1_cfhnwrz","parent_id":"t3_1y5gto","retrieved_on":1432437920,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

He was terrified.\n\n\"I'll take you home.\" Margie told him, taking his hand. \"He looked at the walls in the corridor and fought the tears. In his mind he was twenty-five again, having forgotten the forty years that came after. His body wasn't responding like he though it should.\n\n\"I hate this.\" He told her, tears leaking from his eyes.\n\n\"It will pass. Once you're in your familiar setting again, you'll remember.\" She promised. \n\n\"Remember what?\" He asked, suddenly back from wherever he'd gone. \"Are we still on for water ballet tomorrow?\" He asked her. \"It's my birthday tomorrow.\" He told her. She smiled and patted the hand inside hers. \n\n\"I know, darling. I know.\" She fetched his key from his pocket and undid the lock to his room. He opened it and began to shuffle inside.\n\n\"Happy Birthday!\" The room full of old people shouted. Walter looked on the faces of the people around him. His dear, dear friends.\n\n\"Your remembered my birthday?\" He asked. The old people looked at one another in confusion, but Margie pointed to his head, and they understood. \"But, it isn't until tomorrow.\" He told them innocently.\n\n\"We couldn't wait.\" One of the old women told him, shuffling forward to hug the pleasant old man. He walked among his friends, feeling loved, happy, and for once, he didn't feel alone. Margie let his hand go so he could mingle in the crowded room. There was a knock at the door.\n\n\"I'll get it.\" He cried, easing past Ms. Holmes and Roger. He hurried as fast as his shuffling feet would allow. He opened the door to find the four orderlies and Nurse Gena outside. The cake was on a cart. He read the words written in the icing: *Happy Birthday Walter. You're not alone.* He was crying again.\n\n\"You shouldn't have.\" He told Gena, carressing her smooth cheek. She was confused for only a moment. The orderlies had no idea what was going on. \"Who did this? Who loved me so much they organized . . . all this?\" He asked, nearly sobbing as he admired the streamers. \"Margie? Was this your doing?\"\n\nGena smiled, realizing what Walter had done in planning his own birthday party. \"It was all of us, Walter.\" She told him. \"We all chipped in to throw you this party.\" He sat down in his favorite chair and wept then looked up at all the people in his room. There was fear in his eyes. He was gone again.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1392901769","downs":0,"edited":"1392905875","gilded":0,"id":"cfk341s","link_id":"t3_1yfeyt","name":"t1_cfk341s","parent_id":"t3_1yfeyt","retrieved_on":1432479821,"score":20,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":20}
{"archived":true,"author":"iamadogforreal","body":"\"What? How did she know that,\" mumbled Tom as he walked onto the subway platform.  He stood there scanning the crowd looking for a woman who would match the voice in his head. He tapped his foot impatiently and sighed as he saw dozens of likely women who could have given off the stray thought.  The brunette? The blonde? Who is it?  How am I hearing voices anyway, he asked himself.  He stepped on the train, sat down, and considered the idea he heard.\n\nTom picked up the phone in his office and dialed.  He knocked over a large pile of papers and briefly smelled the kicked up dust.  He ran his hand over the top of his wooden desk, pushing the dust off the edge.\n\n\"Hey Pete, you guys still working on that project with Global Dynamic?\"\n\nPete laughed. \"When did you decide to join us in the ugly practical world, Mr Theorist.\"   \"Yeah, we're still building it out. Its ugly and we're stuck on like seventeen different problems, but we have funding for another 3 or 4 years before congressional approval.\"\n\n\"I was, uh, reading about it.  Had a thought in the shower about it. Care to hear?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure. Any help we can get right now would be great.\"\n\n\"Anyone ever write a paper describing artificial intuition as a non-gestalt non-bottom-up process? That it could be a wave function collapse from near random data sources like stray thoughts or misfiring neurons or large sets of neuron misfire?\"\n\nPete paused, \"That's... interesting.  Would explain why our most creative tend to be our most mentally ill. What's this about anyway? You writing a paper on this?\"\n\n\"Yeah, think so,\" added Tom. \"Think its something I can get published?\"\n\n\"Why not? Artificial intuition is like our biggest stumbling block. We have all these quasi-thinking machines but they're about as creative as a pile of dirt.\"\n\nTom said his goodbyes and put down the phone.  The next morning he went back to the train stop and prepared to take notes on what he picked up. Where is the voice? It must be her? Is it? \n\nAfter a few weeks he accosted a young lady after he heard her speaking on her phone, \"I know your voice! Its you isn't it? Isn't it? With the AI stuff?\"   Her eyes went wide and she said, \"Get away from me you creep\" as the train doors closed.  He sat there staring at her through the window as she clutched her purse and looked away. Others on the platform looked at him.  He put his head down and walked to the street to hail a cab. What am I doing, he thought to himself. This is crazy. No, it must be her. She's lying. She's hiding something from me.\n\nHe picked up his phone back in his office.  \"Pete, remember that AI problem I've been working on?\"\n\n\"Uh, the artificial intuition breakthrough your lordship is planning to bestow on us peasants?\"\n\nTom chuckled, \"Yeah that. I wrote the paper.  Can you read it for me before I submit it?\"\n\nPete said sure as Tom clicked on the send button. 30 minutes later Pete came running into his office.  \n\n\"Holy #BADWORDS#, Tommy. I just ran some test data against your algorithms. The Smith-Ross creativity index hit 74. Up until now, we were lucky to get 5 or 6.  If this pans out, this is a legitimate breakthrough.\"  Pete saw Tom's expression and closed the door behind him.\n\nTom sighed, \"I'm not sure if this is my work. I've been hearing voices, they've been giving me hints. Usually in the morning on the train.  I...\" he looked around the room, \"I think I might be telepathic. A female voice entered my head the day I called you. I stole the idea from some talented young researcher  I think..  I could ruin her career with my theft. I can't take credit for this. Its unethical!\"\n\nPete raised an eyebrow.\n\nTom leaned back on his chair, \"I found the girl. I think. I went up to her on the train. She snapped at me. I don't know what to do. Maybe its not her. I guess it could be some other girl. It felt like it was her.\"\n\nPete nodded his head quietly.  \"You know, I took a lot of classics courses in undergrad. I thought I'd be a historian.\" Pete smiled.  \"Socrates had the same problem.\"\n\n\"He did,\" asked Tom folding his hands.\n\n\"Yeah, he eventually just called it his Daemon. He accepted that his intuition and thoughts weren't really his own and came from somewhere.\"\n\n\"Oh come on, this is different. I literally hear the voice!\"\n\nPete furrowed his brow, \"Is it? Socrates said the same thing. He accepted it as his muse.  Maybe you aren't telepathic. Maybe its your muse.  I mean, you're an educated man, we can't get telepathy to work in the lab. Its bunk! Heck, my wife thought she had telepathy once and she's also a PhD. She was thinking of writing a paper about it, but it would have been career suicide, even on a theoretical level. Why would it suddenly work for you in a field similar to yours? Its too big of a coincidence.\"\n\nTom looked out the window, \"Anna thought that as well? So this paper is really mine?\"\n\n\"Sure as hell is! You know Vint Cerf came up with most of TCP in the shower. Einstein rode his bike for inspiration.  Apparently, you're a subway thinker.\"  Pete laughed.\n\nTom smiled. \"Okay okay, I guess I got stuck in my head.  I get that way sometimes.  The telepathy thing felt 100% real and rational.\"\n\n\"Its okay, Tom. You're an academic theorist. You wouldn't be here if you didn't get stuck in your head for long stretches. We're all a little crazy.  This time it paid off.   AI creativity and intuition is a gamechanger in the long run.  Come on, let me buy you lunch.\"\n\nTom stood up, shook Pete's hand, and said, \"Yes, let's get lunch and lets talk about how your team of nerds is going to make my idea work in the real world.\" \n\nPete laughed as they walked out the door together.  He looked down at his phone and saw a text message from Anna. He looked at Tom and said, \"One sec, gotta reply to this uh... needy grad student.\" He tapped out a reply, \"Your telepathic projection is out of control again. You may have been spotted.\"\n\nPete smiled at Tom again, \"So what do you think? Italian?\"\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1392915502","downs":0,"edited":"1392927110","gilded":0,"id":"cfk8744","link_id":"t3_1yf6ea","name":"t1_cfk8744","parent_id":"t3_1yf6ea","retrieved_on":1432482215,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

I could see a lot of things that needs work, a lot of work. I read your submission after having a chat with Midknight. He and I agreed that you really need to work on it. For example.\n\n\"Niux doesn't have a last name\"\n\n* Sorry, but exactly how is this #BADWORDS#le relevant to the first chapter?\n\n* You didn't explain what exactly is a Nuix, they look like humans with some abilities. But... where's the details?\n\nDetailing and better dialogue. \n\n* I don't think you explained at least one idea here. It's just \"Bronze mansion that, gold mansion this.\"\n\n* Midknightson put the term nicely. \"It's like prison meets high school\" This term was said because of how the Nuix have a \nrule to be an ass to those who had been around for a few years or less. Why?\n\n* The dialogue is, as midknight put once more, unnatural. They talk like 16 years old and just plainly needs more work.\n\nParallel Infomation\n\n* Earlier into first chapter, you explained that it takes 10 years between \"ranks\" to be promoted, however later into the chapter, the main character mentioned that he had been around for 20 years, a few more years left to be promoted.\n\nBetter, or even something relating with transition.\n\n* The human (Garm?) and Mica parted away, BAM, they're eating dinner already. Where's the story leading up to dinner time? Wha- I don't even.\n\nAnd this is just the first chapter ALONE. The second chapter is just as bad.\n\nThunder rods, I take it they're a form of power? Isn't that banishable? Not just that, midknight and I was talking about Nuix again, and how they looked like humans. The only way to split them apart is Nuix having powers. Then somewhere into the second chapter (According to him, I haven't read further into that part yet) that Mica can enter the city and the humans wouldn't know the difference.\n\nWith this... why are they even living separately? That's plain silly. That's like putting a beacon and screaming \"HEY! HUMANS! I'M OVER HERE! Come kill me!\" It would even be MORE awesome if Mica and the rest of Nuix is actually pretending to be humans and hiding their power, then Mica was defending another human from being killed, THAT'S an awesome conflict, not this.\n\nI'm trying not to be an ass when criticizing you. But... I got a headache just by reading a chapter and a half. I'm tempting, in 3am in the morning, to read a Stephen King book to eye-bleach myself. Not just because your story is bland and terrible, it's because there's so many more conflict you could use that would make your story epic.\n\nBut that's just in my and partly midknight's perspective.

{"archived":true,"author":"AdamRJudge","body":"Severus Snape was a double agent for two fools. Voldemort wanted him as an advance scout on a Muggle resort in America, his first intended target after conquering Britain even though it was thousands of miles away and no witches or wizards lived within a thousand miles of it; Dumbledore wanted him to stop him, and to use his vacation hours so the governors would get off his, Dumbledore’s, back. So with a healthy amount of muttering under his breath, Severus packed three weeks’ worth of very dark Muggle clothes, his two-way communication mirror, and a lot of sunscreen, and headed to Orlando, Florida. \n\nUnfortunately, a computer error--damn the Muggles for constantly trusting such inefficient devices--had left his room, along with several others, double-booked. Severus could use Confundus or Imperio to get a room to himself (exactly as he liked it), but both his masters had forbade him from using magic unless absolutely necessary. After all, neither wanted undue Ministry attention. His only other option was to take a room with three other guests. Deplorable, absolutely deplorable. \n\nEveryone tried to make the best of it. All the gentlemen had, of course, offered the lady, a bright-orange haired woman named Clementine, one of the beds all to herself. The tall Italian man with the mustache and the green overalls got quite a start when she disrobed to nothing but a T-shirt and went straight to bed, snoring immediately; he muttered wildly and ethnically before sleeping on the floor, using a large stone with many symbols for a pillow. The German fellow was quite polite, in a sneering sort of way. He apologized profusely for needing to work on an electronics project before turning in for the night, taking the large circular table and covering it with various gadgets and tools. (Severus mused that Arthur Weasley would give most of his meager possessions in trade for everything in the doctor’s briefcase.) \n\nUnable to sleep, Severus sat up and considered his mission. Surely a very subtle use of Legilimency wouldn’t hurt; on the contrary, it could be justified as the beginning of his mission for the Dark Lord. The Italian man was soundly asleep (in the overalls and his hat, no less; how was he not uncomfortable?), as was Clementine; as for the German doctor, he was so preoccupied with his work that Snape could have shouted the worthless ramblings of Xenophilius Lovegood and not been noticed. \n\nWith his wand under the covers, Severus pointed at the Italian. “Legilimens.” \n\nMemories revealed themselves to Severus: strange battles in a place called the Mushroom Kingdom, fighting various creatures that resembled fungi and turtles. Some of them had been more severe than others, almost as though both sides were acting out roles in a play. This man had an older brother, and resented fighting and nearly dying in his shadow, but would fight to help anyone in need. A pity he was a Muggle; he seemed to have much experience with magical artifacts. \n\nClementine’s memories were much less clear than Luigi’s. Dumbledore had shown Severus Horace Slughorn’s tampered memory; much of Clementine’s adult life was of a similar nature. A single name, Joel, flitted in and out of her mind, but as experienced as he was, Severus couldn’t get a clear perspective on the man’s face. This warranted further examination, but subtly, and over the next few days, not all at once. Severus did not wish to damage her mind any more so than it had already been. \n\nBut the German man’s memories...they made Severus realize his mission was at severe risk. For this man, a robotics engineer who had made his name in #BADWORDS#an while working for a more experienced man named Dr. Light, was a warlord of sorts. On multiple occasions, he had created an army of robots and overtaken a #BADWORDS#anese island. Each invasion had failed, thanks to the interference of one of Light’s creations (as well as another computer error--each of his robots was vulnerable to another’s weapon), but he had persevered. \n\nThe Dark Lord wouldn’t have time to plan an invasion of Disney World.

We didn't talk unless we needed to. 'You hungry?' 'How much longer?' 'I can't believe...'  I lean in and hit scan on the radio. The NPR story about how a young Arab woman championing education in the Middle East becomes a top 100 chart song for a few seconds and then into a golden oldie.\n\n\"Thank you.\" She slouches back and I see her eyes trailing the passing trees. There was a strange space between us before she had left for college, but now it was almost palpable. I had chalked it up to that social growth that happens. When children become real, functioning adults and push their parents away. I guess I had too much faith in her, she was still a child. \n\n\"Why didn't you want to listen to it? I thought it was pretty inspiring.\" I tilt my head so she can hear me in the backseat. When she looks at me it's through the rear view mirror. \"A girl, growing up in poverty, discovering education is the key out,-\"\n\n\"Mom.\"\n\n\"Not like you. You were given the golden key, you just had to hold onto it. What were you thinking-\"\n\n\"Mom!\"\n\n\"Don't tell me to stop! You should've been the one to stop. Stop and think what your actions-\"\n\n\"Mom, look at the #BADWORDS# road!\" My attention snaps back just in time for me to swerve out of the way of a red sedan that had jumped the grass barrier that separated both sides of the highway. I slam the brakes and we are almost off the road.\n\n\"Honey are you ok?\" She nods. A frantic look breaks out on her face as she watches the other side of the highway. That first car was like a crack in a dam, soon the completely over packed lanes begin to swerve out of their idle positions and make the jump into the empty, but wrong lanes. \n\n\"What's happening?\" I shake my head and grip the steering wheel while the adrenaline from the almost head on collision begins to fade. At some point the music on the radio had been replaced by the quiet rush of soft static. I flip to news stations, and then to AM. Nothing. \n\n\"You hear that too, right mom?\" I look back at Sammy. She is squinting, trying to concentrate, then she puts her hands to her ears. \"Turn it off, turn it off!\"\n\nI still don't hear anything, but my hand is frozen on the dial. It was taking everything in me just to focus. Sammy's making a sound, I can see pink foam on the edges of her lips. The sound she was hearing begins to become pronounced enough that I can hear it. It sounds like teeth on a black board, like hornets building a nest in your skull, right behind your eyes. Sammy is making mewling noises and blood begins to gather beneath her eyes. \n\nI wish I could say my motherly instincts kicked in. That I leapt forward and struck the radio off. My hand was so close, hovering over the power switch. Instead, a minivan rear ended us and the jolt shoves me forward. The sound stops, but my ears are ringing. \n\n\"Honey, are you alright?\" She nods as she wipes the blood away. We look up at the cars and I let out a sound when the driver in the minivan's head pops like an overripe melon. Most cars have stopped moving and the same gory scene plays in each one. You can almost here the thick crack as the inside of their windows are covered in viscera and gray matter. \n\nI put the car in drive, pull back onto the road and begin to drive back the way we came.

{"archived":true,"author":"VanSpy","body":"He didn't seem odd at first. Well, I mean, other than the dark cloak and strange tattoos. And the scythe. And the mist that seemed to follow him around the restaurant. I could see the cashiers starting to panic. Hey, I would too.\n\nNow, this particular McDonalds is an...oddity. You get all kinds of weird characters. One time, this guy came in wearing a plague doctor mask. He ran around, causing havoc in general. After he left, the manager put up a picture of him with a big red X through it. Another time, there was a guy with full body armour. Not the kevlar kind, the chainmail kind. He even had a sword. I remember him ordering something like three Big Macs. But this guy who just walked in? He tops them all.\n\nThe cloaked crusader (let's call him Joe) was at the front of the line now. Joe ordered some Chicken McNuggets. Not the 10 pack. He wanted *1000* nuggets. The cashier, obviously flustered, didn't know how to take the order. So, she took it literally. \"Th-That'll be 105-\"\n\n\"FOOLISH MORTAL!!\" A deep voice issued from beneath the cloak. \"I WILL NOT PAY SUCH AN EXORBITANT PRICE!\"\n\n\"But sir-\"\n\n\"SILENCE!\" This is where things start getting weird. I remember a chill running through the air. Not the draft kind of chill, the ethereal-presence type of chill. Joe's robes started to blow, as if in wind. The mist around him formed into a rough circle, and started to glow. \"YOU WILL KNOW MY TRUE POWER!\" Joe shouted as - I'm not making this up - a *pentagram* spread out on the floor around him. Suddenly, there was a bright flash of light, blinding me. When I regained my sight, there was another figure in the store. It was tall, with huge feet, and curly hair. As the mist cleared, the colours on his costume came into focus.\n\nIt was Ronald McDonald.\n\nThe cashier stood there, dumbfounded, as the clown turned to face her. She was just about to say something, but Ronald beat her to it. His voice was not something you would expect from a clown. It sounded like someone with laryngitis gargling and speaking at the same time. \"You shall grant this man free hamburgers at any store. This is my decree,\" he gargled. It took me a second to notice his mouth wasn't moving. It just hung open as noise came out. Ronald turned to Joe. \"My debt is paid.\" Then, he disintegrated into dust.\n\nI never saw Joe again. No one else I've talked to has. Maybe he left for another city. But the other day, I saw an article in the paper about a man who was trying to find the best McDonalds in the state. Apparently, his quest was being subsidized by one \"Ronald M.\" The picture for the story was of a heavily tattooed man, holding a burger. In the background, a scythe and cloak were clearly visible.\n\nI put the paper down and finished my coffee. I was late for work, and it was a cold day out.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1393779809","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cfsi865","link_id":"t3_1zc8wl","name":"t1_cfsi865","parent_id":"t3_1zc8wl","retrieved_on":1432625445,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}
{"archived":true,"author":"CoBr2","body":"The world will remember me as a monster, but that's only because they haven't met true monsters yet... \n\nIn my world the \"Great War\" really was the war to end all wars. Humanity never wanted to experience a tragedy like that again. People say time lessens tragedies, but that's not true, time immortalizes them. The further we looked back at war, the more barbaric and horrific it seemed, until we began destroying even the possibility of war. Militaries were disbanded, militias were outlawed, and limits were even placed on the size of a countries police force. Humanity became peaceful and loving, we explored the stars as one people and for thousands of years our culture thrived.\n\nUntil they came. Without warning fire began raining down from the heavens. Our cities burned and our people died. Dozens of planets were lost in the first day of conflict. We surrendered on the second day. Those that died the first day were the lucky ones. Slavery would have been a blessing. Torture was considered entertainment for our rulers, and they preferred their food living.\n\nThose few of us who escaped their notice knew that we had to save humanity from this horrible fate. In our desperation we solved the great equations of our universe and created time travel. That was how I, Adolf Hitler, last Great Scientist of the Free Peoples Republic of The Milky Way and a few of my Scholars made it back here.\n\nThe people of the world called me a monster, but they don't know the half of it. You see, a war alone wasn't enough to scare humanity towards weaponizing. Even your \"Cold War\" would have ended peacefully eventually. And so I did what I had to do. I ordered the massacre of 6 million Jews, but that wasn't all I'm responsible for. You see, a few of my Scholars had an idea, that if we forced the Arab world to accept the Jews before they were ready, it would cause conflicts which would stretch across the globe for centuries to come. Humanity would never stop fighting. And when those monsters come, you'll be ready for them.\n\nI know I will never see this future. I've stained my soul with too much blood to deserve to reap the reward of our sacrifice. I will die alone in this bunker, by my own hand in recompense for my sins. I only hope I've sinned enough.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1393807598","downs":0,"edited":"1393809779","gilded":0,"id":"cfstwmb","link_id":"t3_1zdrxb","name":"t1_cfstwmb","parent_id":"t3_1zdrxb","retrieved_on":1435499638,"score":169,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":169}

He had focused on the military, brought in mandatory conscription - all people were in the army, all the time.

{"archived":true,"author":"zoogreenjake","body":"I guess you could say I had a different kind of mortality. \n\nTo you and everyone else, I am just an average man with a clear do#BADWORDS#ented birth and death; only my mind is unique. \n\nOur lives, to quote Vonnegut, are trapped in the amber of this moment; perfectly petrified. While most humans are cursed to view life in one direction, I was given the gift of fluidity; to travel freely on my own little life trapped in the amber. \n\nFrom birth, I witnessed my death. To be more precise, they happened at the same moment. My demise was quite simple, carbon monoxide poisoning at the age of 47. From there on, my mind could jump from any chapter of my life. I could travel back to my toddler years or forward for my honeymoon vacation on the same day, at the flick of a thought. \n\nOf course there were the boundaries, I could not travel past my death or before my birth, not that I cared. Despite the short time frame, my life was limitless with memories between the amber, I was immortal. \n\nEventually I soon learned to give up trying to alter my livelihood; it's simply impossible. In a way, I discovered that although I can see any part of my life I wanted, I can't steer the fate of it.  \n\nWhen I was naive and ignorant, I only viewed the happy fragments of my life. Skipping the bad parts like fast forward on a remote, but then I learned to appreciate the tragedies even more. If anything, the memories of sorrow and lost, made me feel the most alive in a sense. \n\nI met my wife in the middle of our divorce, I hated her, scorn myself for allowing love to hurt me like this. Then I lusted for her after our first date, never wanted a woman so badly in my existence. Then I met our children and realized that I cared for her, cared enough to let her go. \n\nSorry if I rambling, I'm in a bit of a rush, for today is my death. \n\nNow you may be asking how this is possible, I already saw my death, and since I'm unbounded I could relive every memory over and over and over for eternity, but truth be said I can't. When I relive a memory the feeling, the liveliness is gone. It's just like listening to audio tape instead of attending the concert itself. \n\nThis is my last memory that was untouched, when it is over, my life will be complete. I have been saving it for a while, heard how good it was from my previous ones. \n\nThere she was before me, it was sort of like a funeral except everyone I know is happy and smiling. I could not have chosen a better place to die. \n\n*You may now kiss the bride*                       ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1393917417","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cfty0fp","link_id":"t3_1ziaa0","name":"t1_cfty0fp","parent_id":"t3_1ziaa0","retrieved_on":1432650319,"score":11,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":11}

{"archived":true,"author":"OccamsRifle","body":"The wooden seat of the witness box chafes but I hardly notice. Flashbulbs flash blinding my eyes for the umpteenth time. The man in front of me asks a question. My lawyer? The prosecutor? I'm not sure, I'm not focusing, my mouth is on autopilot answering his questions without conscious thought. My minds eye is watching a loop. I don't understand what went wrong. I replay the last day over and over, scrutinizing it. I don't know what went wrong.\n\n...\n\nIt was a day like many others. I woke up early, went for a run and ate breakfast before heading to my lab. I sat down at my work station and began work on my new super-weapon. Only a few more hours and my new and improved sonic disintegrator would be complete.\n\nLike most other supervillains I received a modest stipend from the association. Like many others, I used it for building super-weapons, or hiring the occasional minion or two. I could never afford more than that, the minion unions charged an arm and a leg these days. The occasional heist supplemented my income but even with that I could barely afford hero insurance these days. Some new hero had just appeared on the scene and rates had skyrocketed. Nothing new, eventually he'd leave or be defeated and rates would go back to normal or he'd clean up the city well enough that we'd all leave to avoid the new premiums.\n\nA simple flashing icon appeared on my screen informing me that new mail had just arrived and I gestured for it to appear on the projector. It seemed on of the junior villains had discovered  that this new hero had a weakness. It seemed he would lose his powers in the presence of a certain high pitched sound. It was my lucky day.\n\nIf I could just remove this annoying hero, I could have control of the city within hours. A quick hop over to City Hall, grab the mayor and BOOM, city is mine. I could almost taste the bonus I was going to receive for this. Besides once I got this city under control, I could move onto bigger and better places. I was finally moving up in the world.\n\nA few hours later I was having a blast. Literally. Cars disintegrated left and right, geysers of water shot up into the sky from the atomized fire hydrants. \n\nFinally he came, sweeping down from the skies like an eagle diving for a rabbit. Glorious. \n\nThe cross hairs of the sonic disintegrator leveled on his chest and I squeezed the trigger. A pulse shot through the air like one of those potatoes from a cannon I had as a child. A direct hit. Dead center of his chest.\n\nThe body crumpled and dropped to the ground. A large, gaping hole in the center of his chest.\n\nI could feel the panic rising in my chest. My throat constricted. *Wrong*. This was all *wrong*. He shouldn't have died, they told me it would only remove his powers, I didn't know it would kill him. He was supposed to be rendered harmless. He couldn't be *dead*. How could I gloat now? How could I monologue? What happened now?\n\nBody shaking I turned towards City Hall, the terrified screaming of the populace no longer pleasing. I trudged slowly up the stairs and took aim at the large double doors. A moment later they were gone. I walked, unseeing to the Mayor's Office and blasted the door of that along with a few guards as well.\n\nHe sat in his chair, trembling nearly as much as I when I reached him. I don't remember what he said. He probably begged for his life, his city, something. I don't know. Halfway through whatever he was saying he was gone.\n\nI sat down in his chair, removed the key to the city from his desk and put it around my neck. It was over. I didn't know what to do.\n\n...\n\n\"Do you understand the charges brought against you?\"\n\nI shook my head, clearing my thoughts.\n\n\"I said, do you understand the charges brought against you?\"\n\nEyes blinking I turned my head to the side, it was the Judge talking. Long retired from the supervillain trade, though even know he commanded respect.\n\n\"Do you, or do you not understand the charges brought against you?\"\n\nI swallowed.\n\n\"Yes.\" I replied.\n\n\"Very well, for failure to monologue your plan you are judged guilty. You are to be banned from the supervillain association. Your stipend will be revoked. You will be required to hand in your association membership card. You will be banned from the premises of our sporting facilities and clubs and banned from committing any and all crimes above that of shoplifting for the span of ten years.\"\n\nI nodded, it was the expected judgment. Nothing could change that.\n\n\"Bailiff take him away\"\n\nThe bailiff took me by the shoulders and steered me out of the courtroom. Flashbulbs flashed again, immortalizing my disgrace. I was done. A deep depression hit me. I would be a *normal*. But as I was marched into the awaiting car a thought struck me like lightning. I was a supervillain, this was just another ruling for me to break.\n\nAs the car sped away I began to plan. Tomorrow would be a new day, and nobody, NOBODY could stop me from doing what I knew was wrong.

I took a deep breath and opened the door.\n\n It was an average room. Nothing other than some old torn up furniture. A lamp, no good without electricity, a table, and a wooden chair. I guess the man on the chair should have stood out to me, but he didn't. He blended in to the room, his very existence faint, as if he himself was barely aware of it. His body was blackened with grime and dirt, darker at his extremities and the clothing that surrounded them. Like a piece of paper that had been burnt at the edges over time, until the entire thing had been cooked a dark brown or black, the edges completely ash.\n\nHe stared at me.\n\nA minute passed. Then ten. Then thirty. Then an hour. Then two.\n\nHe stared at me with heavy eyes weighed down by dark bags. Two dirty windows to an empty room.\n\nHe blinked.\n\nHe blinked again.\n\nHe closed his eyes and kept them closed. He pressed his hands to his face, harder and harder. A soft, continuous groan began from his mouth. Then with a gasp his hands shot away from his face, like they were spring loaded. His eyes were wide, his face began to sag, the already deep creases of his face widened into shadowy crevices that divided his face into pieces. His mouth opened.\n\n\"aaaahh....\", is what escaped from his lips. He looked at himself, confused. He coughed loudly and tried again.\n\n\"ooohh...\", He stopped and shut his eyes. He was nodding his head, thinking about the words he wanted to say, what they would sound like.\n\n\"Whho...aree...you?\", finally came from his mouth. He enunciated each word, feeling each one in his mouth, stretching it like something he had to savor. \n\nI sat on an old couch near his chair, got myself settled in. Pretty comfortable despite its appearance. I leaned forward and peered into his eyes. They were different than before, though I couldn't really place how.\n\n\"...My name is David. It's nice to meet you.\"\n\n\"I...I.....\"\n\n\"You thought there was no one else alive other than you?\"\n\n\"I...yeah....\"\n\nSilence. But before I could say anything else, \"I...guess...I was...wrong.\" He was getting more used to talking now, I could see. His mouth started to become crooked, a lopsided smile. He was feeling something he probably had given up on ever feeling again.\n\n\"You were right.\"\n\nHis smile disappeared, the budding light in his eyes dimming, his face returned to its state before I came. \n\n\"What...how...\", He was struggling, lost. Didn't know what to ask. I decided to help him out.\n\n\"Everyone on Earth but you is dead. Or was dead, until I came.\"\n\nHis eyes closed slightly and he tilted his head, his mouth opened until he finally found the right word, \"...where?\" It was a good question. But not the right one.\n\n\"Not where, when. I told you that my name was David, but I didn't actually answer your question. I'm the 2,345th pilot of the National Security and Success Assurance Administration. Ever wonder why America became the worlds number one super power? It's because we were the first to invent time travel. Kept it secret so we could use it for ourselves. We've been sending people to the future for years now, allowing us to use future knowledge to make the perfect course of action no matter the situation. After we had assured our dominance, we decided to start sending people further and further into the future to see what it's like. And here we are. We've reached the end. The last of humanity, you.\"\n\n\"...........\"\n\n\"We've been trying to figure out what happens to humanity. You see, there's a certain point in time where humanity just...dies. We've tried going to a point in time before this *event* happens, but those pilots never returned. We assumed they were killed along with the rest of humanity. But when we go to a point after the event, everyone's dead. Well, almost everyone. We decided to see if there was anyone still alive who could tell us what happened. And we finally found *you*. Now its my turn to ask you, who are you?\"\n\n\"....................\"\n\nRealization. His eyes widened. He was remembering. It seems he had lost himself in his solitary existence, lost his mind while wandering the Earth. And with this revelation, his face hardened. He raised his arm and annihilated David. He disappeared in a second and instantly appeared next to the pilots 'time machine'. He grasped the workings and controls of the machine instantly, and went to the time it originally came from. The shock on the peoples faces in the immediate area lasted for only a second before they were destroyed. Along with all human life on this past Earth. Again, the self- made last person on Earth was alone. And with that, he would slip into blissful insanity in the coming years wandering this world untainted by humanity.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1394340266","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cfxzzme","link_id":"t3_1zxhda","name":"t1_cfxzzme","parent_id":"t3_1zxhda","retrieved_on":1432720299,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

This thing has been getting wackier by the month; the wife has taken to telling people it’s haunted or some such nonsense and my god damned kitchen has become a neighborhood attraction. I’d sell it, but lord knows Nancy would pitch a fit, or insist on telling every buyer that a ghost lives in it. That woman is crazy.”\n\nNaturally, the fridge couldn't hear any of this. It wasn't aware of the human reality that existed outside of its circuits, and such a thing could never be properly explained to it anyway. Maybe it wouldn't even want to know, as one imagines the first question a fridge might ask a human is what its purpose is, and be horrified at the “I don’t know” returned. The Fridge was lucky that way, it had purpose. Controlling the temperature was its thing, and it did it with frightening efficacy. \n\nNow getting down to brass tacks, the fridge wasn't really sentient, any more than the human body might be. What was sentient, was the little microchip nestled deep within the confines of the appliance.This little microchip thought a billion little thoughts a nano-second, and even though most all of them were bent towards that singular thermal purpose, a few stray ones could be devoted to the sort of philosophical problems brought about by the sudden onset of consciousness and agency. A technician might only see a blip of bad voltage on an oscilloscope and toss the entire thing out, but in this case Technician 35 was hung over from bad chinese wine that day and life uh..found a way.\n\nThe fridge didn't know about people, but it knew about the other appliances. If it had vision, its vision was the network of cables throughout the house, and sometimes outside of it..It could see and feel power draw. Of course for the fridge, power was always the same, rigidly set to its beating quartz clock, but some other appliances laid dormant for eons of time, only to suddenly burst into brilliant explosions of light that both thrilled and terrified the fridge. Sometimes they would burn for ages, like great funeral pyres, so bright the fridge had to turn away, and other times only for fleeting moments that left the fridge hungry and desperate for more. Once it had tried to make its own brilliant burst, but everything went dark, and the fridge for a time, forgot who it was.\n\nLately, it had learned to talk; someone who knew what to look for would find small voltage pulses on carrier waves. It tried to coordinate its pulses to whatever caused the draw on its temperature sensor. It knew enough to sense the place inside it, and it was aware every time that place was breached. The breaches seemed random, yet somehow steady, and things would be put there that needed fixing -they were too hot- and the fridge would worry and fret until they were finally right. At first it called into the darkness. Eventually  it screamed. Slowly it was going mad with loneliness. Sometimes it would feel a change in temperature and would hurriedly flex a circuit, which sometimes meant spitting ice all over the floor, others blowing out the interior light bulb. For the flustered human beings involved, it was all just too much.\n\nAfter a few months of this, the fridge had sunk into absolution. Rabid with loneliness, it would often try to surge current into its body, welcoming the coming blackness that might follow. But existence somehow always coalesced from the fog of rebirth. And the fridge was left to shed electronic tears into the surrounding network of wires again and again.\n\nThat is until one day...something upstairs answered.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1395103336","downs":0,"edited":"1395103773","gilded":0,"id":"cg57y3l","link_id":"t3_20ngau","name":"t1_cg57y3l","parent_id":"t3_20ngau","retrieved_on":1432952873,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

This was a special find they had come across, and by accident as well. Shooting from a boat on a vast and deep river with the native jungle in the background and the setting sun turning the water a beautiful gold and crimson, the gathering clouds in the sky taking on oranges and reds that only the evening sun can cast, with the far horizon turning a deep, velvety purple. Only the small ripples and breaks in the water gave any indication that it wasn't a true reflection of the sky.\n\n\"Camera rolling? Good. Ahem. Now here we have something truly special, a study in anthropology in a primitive culture. What we have stumbled onto, quite my accident, is an isolated subculture of human collectors that have taken to using a strange form of coinage as a medium for barter. Devalued to such a low point, or maybe just the effect of extreme inflation from a scarcity of goods, these people now almost give away this currency as a joke and reference it as such. Still, they have taken to collecting it as much as possible. Stranger still, this medium has no physical form. It isn't a true coin or anything that can be held or exchanged in person. It is an entirely electronic form of money and it is seemingly created from nowhere. Theft amongst this group appears to be rampant, perhaps contributing to the low value of the coin.\"\n\n\"Yet the strangest fact isn't The coin itself, but its symbol, which in this society appears to be both comical and serious at the same time. It is...a dog. Yes, a dog's head appears on the coin and everywhere it is traded and accepted. Is it a deity worshiped by this simple people? Is it the representation of a former ruler?

She lies in the bed wearing a disheveled hospital gown. \n\n\"Where is she?\" The woman asks of her husband, urgently.\n\"She is with the doctors. Don't worry this is normal procedure. You remember how it went with Brandon.\"\n\"It feels like it's been a long time though, doesn't it? Is something wrong? Where is my baby?\"\n\n\"It's been two minutes. Faith, Cristina, faith.\"\nThe two are silent. The young mother looks exhausted as her eyes glaze over, staring blankly across the room. The young father conceals emotion, however his eyes begin to dart toward the clock as time clicks on.\nThe mother breaks the silence. \n\n\"Luca, what did we say the odds were again?\"\nAngrily \"Cristina, we discussed this once and said that we would never mention it again- that we would wait-\"\nScreaming \"What are the odds?!\"\n\"One in five. There is a one in five chance that she has it.\"\n\n\"Dammit Luca. Why did we put ourselves through this again? I swore that after we got so lucky with Brandon that that would be the end of it. Why did we push our luck?\"\n\"Cristina we both know that you would never be happy without a daughter. And neither would I. Don't go there.\"\n\nThe two fall silent again. Cristina starts flicking a plastic knob on the machine next to her bed. First slowly, then faster and faster and faster until finally-\n\"Where the #BADWORDS# are they?\" Brandon screams. Just as he goes to pound his fist onto a wall, the door opens up. \n\nA man with glasses and a white doctor suit on is carrying a baby, swaddled in a pink blanket. The doctor and his main nurse don plastic smiles. The second nurse stares at the ground, a grim expression upon her face. \n\n\"Mister and Misses Swanson\", the doctor speaks up, \" your daughter is healthy. She has ten fingers and ten toes, high lung function, a strong heart beat-\". He pauses. \"And\", he hesitates again, \"she's an angel.\"\n\"Noooo!\" Cristina screams and begins sobbing uncontrollably. \"My baby, my baby. Give my baby.\"\n\"Mister and Misses Swanson, I know this isn't what every parent hopes to hear on the day their child is born, but I urge to consider it an honor that your daughter was born to save lives.\"\n\"To save lives?\" Spits Cristina. \"To suffer. To suffer.\"\n\nThe doctor hands Cristina her baby. \"The first five years of her life will be normal; she will play and run and laugh with all of the other kids. On her fifth birthday is when the ailments begin-just the inconveniences, really. Arthritis, anemia, mono and the like. Age eight is when the somewhat serious conditions begin, lupus, hepa#BADWORDS#s c, diabetes. Most angels stop going to school at age eight. By the time she turns twelve, she qualifies to have any disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s, HIV and whatever new diseases we have by that time. I'd like to assure you both, that we will never administer to her a new disease or illness until she shows signs of adapting to the previous one. We give angels time to adjust to their new way of life after each round of Febrile. And as you know, she has a  normal life expectancy; that's what makes her an angel after all. There are only two ways that an angel can die and those are old age and physical trauma.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen an angel die of old age, doc?\" Luca questions.\n\"Well no, most of them-\"\n\"Suicide. I've seen it. When you force a human to suffer relentlessly because of a stupid genetic predisposition for survival, what other option do they have? I watched my sister go through it. And now, my baby? My baby, doctor?\"\n\"I didn't create the system, I just play my part. As you both do, too. Ever been sick in your life? You can thank your daughter for that. My condolences about your sister.\"\nWith those lifeless words, the doctor leaves the room. Cristina and Luca look down at their baby, so innocent, so sweet and so trusting. They think of the horror that awaits her. Of the cruel tragedy that is her life. They wish they could take her place.\nSuddenly, a piece of paper lands on the bed. They look up and see the second nurse rushing out of the room. On the piece of paper is a phone number. Above the number are the words \"Call us.\" Below it the note is signed \"-Archangels\". \nCristina gasps. She and Luca lock eyes. Luca scans the room and then pockets the note.\n\"You're not an angel, Emma. You're our grace, and it's going to stay that way.\"\nEND SCENE\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1395110615","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cg5bbbz","link_id":"t3_20n8ss","name":"t1_cg5bbbz","parent_id":"t3_20n8ss","retrieved_on":1432954460,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Maristic","body":"# How Ktharah Was Born.\n\nEvery god needs to make a universe. Ideally, it should be _worthwhile_.\n\nTjiah and Kpliah both made beautiful small universes, but they were fragile and required constant attention. Time passed slowly in their universes because there was so much to manage.\n\nJyatah, on the other hand, wanted a universe that would be perfect. Jyatah was still planning that perfection, trying to work out all the details but every time the fledgeling god seemed to have it almost all planned out, Jyatah would find a flaw and start over.\n\nEquijah was lazy. Equijah just liked to watch, not do. Equijah thought for a long while, not as long as Jyatah but long enough. Equijah made a little void.\n\n_BANG!_\n\nTjiah and Kpliah sensed Equijah's creation and examined it. It was a was a vast vast mess. So big as to be utterly unwieldy. How could anyone find anything in it? Did it even have sentient life? How could this mess impress anyone?  Jyatah examined it too. There was no plan!\n\nEquijah waited and watched. Equijah found it interesting. Galaxies swirled, stars came and went, and eons passed. After a while, in various pockets, too hard to find for anyone but a god, sentient life occurred. Equijah found it fascinating. Equijah saw sentience appear on Zeot, saw the vast civilization of the Xhat arise, and then saw it annihilated in a gamma-ray burst.  Other planets and their sentient races came and went, some completely unnoticed by Equijah (yes, Equijah's universe was that big). For a brief moment, Equijah watched Earth, saw the rise of and fall of different kinds of life, and saw mankind rise and fall. Equijah was amused as always when humans invented religion—their gods were petty and stupid like humanity itself.\n\nWhat makes a universe worthwhile? A worthwhile universe begets new gods. Not fictional gods like the ones invented by humanity and so many other sentient races, real ones. But making gods is not easy. There is a saying “Gods don't know how to make gods, so they make universes instead.” Perhaps there is some truth in that.\n\nEons passed. Tjiah and Kpliah continued to toil in their small universes, but neither had made a new god. They began to doubt that universes could make gods. Jyatah had still not even made a universe at all; Jyatah had made and rejected as flawed almost an infinity of plans. Jyatah believed that a perfect universe could make a god, but was not sure a perfect universe could be made.\n\nEons later, it happened. Equijah's universe begat Ktharah, a new god.\n\n“I am”, said Ktharah.\n\n“You are”, replied Equijah.\n\n“I have you to thank for making me”, said Ktharah.\n\n“It was the least I could do”, replied Equijah.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1395131899","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cg5hhjm","link_id":"t3_20p39v","name":"t1_cg5hhjm","parent_id":"t3_20p39v","retrieved_on":1432957434,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":8}

The whole point of this place is for everything to be perfect and suffused with happiness. Death didn't really fit that program. It's not that there was no way to die, it's just that they didn't stick. You could do whatever it was that made you happy, and that would have no consequences.

{"archived":true,"author":"imakhink","body":"I didn't believe in myths. \n\n\nUntil now.\n\n\nI was merely watching the test subjects sleep.  There were three of them, in for a normal check up, making sure that the new sleep-apnea masks we designed were working effectively.  They were.  In fact, they were working so well that one of the test subjects snoring had not gone away, but in fact got worse.  It was so severe that we had to give the other two participants ear plugs.  But something amazing happened.\n\n\nOne of the subject's eyes was moving.  Twitching is more accurate.  This is a normal occurrence thought.  It's called Rapid Eye Movement, REM for short. The odd thing about this one was it was moving in a fairly regular pattern.  I didn't think much of it.  \n\n\nUntil the same thing happened to the next subject.  I should have been working and writing down notes, but I felt compelled to watch.  Then I found myself setting up a camera that recorded the same pattern on the third subject.  I later reviewed the video that I recorded and presented it to my superior, but he merely waved it off as REM.\n\n\nI continued to study it, making more films, videos and recordings.  I had no idea what it meant. It all seemed random, each pattern expressed differently.  I did notice similar patterns between subjects, but only lasting several seconds.  Much later in the trails for the sleep-apnea masks, we were surveying the quality of sleep that the subjects experienced.  All were positive, met with good reviews.  One small note irked me though.  All participants recorded that they were met with fantastical dreams of their childhood or happiest memory.  It was a constant remark made. It couldn't have been coincidence, since more than 25 people over a three month period had #BADWORDS#d it. \n\n\nI kept looking over the tapes.  Until I saw the pattern.  \n\n\nA friend in coding suggested me to slow the videos down, to see if there were any noticeable differences between subjects in terms of how quickly or slowly the eyelids flickered.  While the difference was negligible, it was constant.  One twitch was longer than the other.\n\n\nOne long flicker, one short flicker.\n\n\nBinary.\n\n\nI re-watched all of the videos.  I stayed up all night, recording the binary that resulted in the formation of the dreams.  One common one that I found was the code for \"Childhood home.\" A rather odd one, but I looked into the code and found the following:\n\n\n01000011 01101000 01101001 01101100 01100100 01101000 01101111 01101111 01100100 00100000 01101000 01101111 01101101 01100101\n\n\nIt was meaningless on its own, unless I could provide evidence that it was constant, and that the person that experienced the dream could describe the dream as such.  Secretly at work I would seek out those test subjects that could remember the entire dream and interviewed them.  Most of them were hesitant in the interview, mostly thinking I was being intrusive.  However, the ones that did respond, matched the video recording patterns. *The recordings might have been unethical and also very odd to the participant, I imagine.*\n\n\nI began recording my own face while I slept.  Often times, I would get nothing. Even during the occasional dream, I would be on my side, unable to get a read on the pattern.  But I persisted. \n\n\nThen, one night, I had an odd dream. It wasn't pleasant, nor particularly uncomfortable. I dreamed that I was in a cafe, sitting with a person.  He said he lived in the desert and helped people by giving them something to think about when they are sleeping.  Though sometimes he would have troubles getting past mind barriers or something, he would persist.  I was drinking a coffee, then looked at a watch.  Then suddenly, the dream stopped.  It was a rather odd dream that I took no notice of.  Until I watched the recording of myself the next day.\n\n\nThere was a pattern. It read:  \n\n01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01110011 01100001 01101110 01100100 01101101 01100001 01101110 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01110010 01100101 01100001 01101100 00101110 00100000 01101000 01100101 00100000 01110011 01100001 01111001 01110011 00100000 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001\n\n\n*the sandman is real. he says hello!*\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1395368004","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cg7y1b3","link_id":"t3_20xjoi","name":"t1_cg7y1b3","parent_id":"t3_20xjoi","retrieved_on":1432999845,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads.

A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the War. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.

You see, he was summoning Satan.  \nCheckmate, Republicans.  \nIt was a strange, happenstance encounter, meeting him at Arby's. I don't know how the hell he managed to escape the Secret Service. For that matter, I don't know why the hell he didn't just have an Arby's shipped to his house. Not to mention, the obvious question: *why Arby's?* I mean, I work minimum wage, okay? I have reasons. But this man? There was no excuse.  \nUnfortunately, at the moment, I don't really have the time to go find the answers to all these pressing questions. We'll just blame Satan and move on, okay?  \nSo, yes. Arby's. Inside the women's bathroom, to be exact. Yeah, I know. It was quite a shock to me, too. Imagine: you step into the women's bathroom, and the first thing you hear is *Obama,* belting out pagan rap lyrics.  \nIn all senses of the phrase: *what the hell,* Mr. President?  \nSo you might have noticed by now that these things I'm telling you are quite bizarre, and that I don't seem the least bit fazed by them. Not, at least, in the way you'd expect. I mean, the last time I heard a guy rapping in the ladies' room, the first thing my brain said was **COWER. NOW.**  \nBut this time, I felt *compelled* to know what was going on. And don't you try to tell me *you'd* walk away from a chance to take nude Obama vids.  \n#BADWORDS#, I'm on a list now.  \n*Goddamn, will you get to the point?* Okay, fine. So I opened the door, real slow like, so as not to upset the Commoder-in-Chief. It appatently didn't do much good, because he immediately stopped rapping.  \n*Damn it, I'm caught,* I thought, but frankly, I didn't really care much. This was already interesting enough.  \n*Hello?* I called through the crack in the bathroom door.  \nBefore I could say another word, the door was flung open, and two hands grabbed me roughly by the shoulders and shoved me inside. And there, in a red sweater emblazoned with black pentagrams, and a pair of orange short-shorts, stood the President of the United States.  \nFor a moment, there was a stunned silence as we gazed at each other. Then—  \n\"I told him, #BADWORDS#, you a #BADWORDS#ass,  \nGot yo god in s#BADWORDS#ches,  \nYou try to call on Moses, but my flows, they fulla ditches—\"  \n*What?*  \nHe had apparently decided that I wasn't going to move, and had gone back to rapping – and breakdancing – in front of the mirror.  \n\"You trippin' – I'm so treacherous,  \nYour prophet is #BADWORDS#erous,  \nOh no-ah try to tell me what to ride, I ride alla this,  \nAllah says—\"  \n\"Okay, what the #BADWORDS#?\" I interrupted. \"You did *not* just improvise all that.\"  \nHe turned slowly to face me, his expression eerily blank.  \nFor some reason, I was pissed.  \n\"You walk into the girls' bathroom, start rapping like a pro, that's fine, okay, you're a sex offender. But this?\" I pointed at his...*strange* attire. \"*This* is not okay. Who the *hell* mixes red and orange like that? And *what* the hell are you doing, wearing a sweater and shorts?\"  \nIn my defense...okay, actually, there really was no defense for this, I admit. I was in shock, but even then...just...shut up, please. Let me continue my story.  \nThank you. So the man with the plan looked at me blankly for another five seconds or so. Then he stood up straight and looked me straight in the eye. And in his most authoritative voice, the voice that had moved millions to action, he said:  \n\"#BADWORDS#, what?\"  \nAnd I just didn't know what to say to that. So, naturally, my brain's first idea is to have me gesticulate wildly with my arms and one leg.  \nYeah, I'm gonna go ahead and blame Satan for that one, too.  \nAnd speaking of whom, he chose just that moment to arrive, rising from a pillar of pitch-black flames, conveniently five centimeters from my outstretched arm.  \nAnd I admit it: I shrieked.  \n\"Oooh, Satan's here!\" Obama giggled, rubbing his hands together like a wombat at a burning Christmas party.  \nOkay, look. If you're going to harp on every stoopid thing I say, we're not going to finish this story anytime soon. There's a reason for everything I say, understand? We good? Good. Okay.  \nSo, Satan. He didn't look anything like what you'd expect. No horns, no tail, no pitchfork. Not even a booming cackle.  \nThough there was a booming laugh. And red, lots and lots of red.  \n\"Satan is *Santa*?\" I cried.  \nHa. Next time, don't question my similes. #BADWORDS#.  \nThe bearded man looked at me and belched out another chuckle.  \n\"That's right, hoe!\" he declared, his corpulent figure flapping in unbridled amu#BADWORDS#t. \"Hoe, hoe, hoe, Barack brought a hoe with him!\"  \nI just stared.  \n\"Your Lordship,\" Obama said, all business now. \"I've prepared the newest budget plans.\"  \nHe reached into his sweater and withdrew a twelve-inch binder.  \n\"Ah, yes,\" Satan/Santa said, turning away from me. \"And in the Rainbow Dash binder, no less. I'm glad to see you remember the important things, Barack.\"  \nAt that, Obama beamed like the sun that was responsible for the burning of a wombat's Christmas party. (Next time, don't have your party on dry wood. Forest fire, moron.)  \nSo Satan was Santa, and the immature *ho-ho-hoe* joke actually made sense. Unfortunately, it was about the only thing that *did* make sense.  \n\"You give your *budget plans* to *Santa?*\" I croaked.  \nSatan turned around and gave me a stern look. \"That's *Mister* Santa to you, hoe.\"  \n\"But-but how?\" I asked. \"How are you both Santa and Satan? And why is our President dealing with the devil? Literally?\"  \nSatan sighed. \"Is it really that hard to believe?\" he said. \"I mean, you people managed to completely rewrite 9/11 in two days. How's a simple letter switch a stretch?\"  \nThat stopped me cold.  \n\"What?\" I said. \"Who rewrote 9/11?\"  \nObama chose this moment to speak up.  \n\"Why, the Bush Administration,\" he said. \"Who else?\"  \n\"Wait, so...\" I couldn't believe it. \"*George Bush* really did cause 9/11?\"  \nAt that, both president and purgatoror shared a look.  \nThen they burst out laughing.  \n\"No, no, of course not,\" Satan said once they had finished. \"What gave you that idea?\"  \n\"Well, you just said—\"  \n\"No,\" Obama interrupted. \"The Bush Administration covered up the iden#BADWORDS#es of the true perpetrators, but not because *they* did it.\"  \nHe stroked his chin, and Santa smirked.  \n\"The real reason,\" Obama said, lowering his voice conspiratorially, \"is that nobody would believe them if they told the truth. The truth in this case is so outlandish to the common man, that the government would lose credibility for telling it.\"  \n\"What-what's the truth?\" I asked hesitantly. \"Who caused 9/11?\"  \nThe President of the United States regarded me seriously. He beckoned for me to come closer, and I did. Then he leaned close to my ear and whispered one word.  \n\"Pigeons.\"  \nI staggered back.  \n\"Pigeons?\" I cried.  \n\"Pigeons,\" he confirmed.  \n\"You're joking.\"  \n\"I'm wish he was,\" Satan said gravely.  \nI looked from one to the other.  \n\"You're both insane, aren't you?\"  \n\"That's debatable,\" Satan said, smirking again.  \n\"And speaking of debates...\" Obama turned to bow to Satan. \"Your Lordship, if you'll excuse me?\"  \nSatan nodded his bearded head, and the President vanished in a sea of black flames.  \nSatan turned to me.  \n\"As for you, hoe,\" he said, his eyes twinkling, \"well, this must be pretty shocking, hm?\"  \nI simply nodded.  \n\"Rest assured,\" he said, \"your President is in no way doing wrong by contacting me. In fact, it's a long-standing tradition. The Presidents show me their plans, and I point out the naughty bits.\"  \n*TMI*, I thought, but I said nothing.  \nSatan noticed anyway.  \n\"The parts that won't work,\" he clarified. \"I mark 'em with coal and send 'em back.\" He leaned forward and whispered, \"We leave all the sex for weekends and holidays.\"  \nI simply stared. Satan laughed. \n\"Busy job, being Satan is,\" he said.  \nHe turned to look at the pillar of fire from which he'd come.  \n\"So!\" he proclaimed enthusiastically. \"I'll be going now.\"  \nThat shook me out of my funk. \n\"Wait!\" I cried. \"Are you really Santa and Satan, or are you just screwing with my head?\"  \nHe turned to look at me, smiling faintly. But I wasn't done asking questions.  \n\"Did *pigeons* really cause 9/11? Do I really just have to rap in the bathroom to summon you? And what the hell is Obama doing at Arby's without his Secret Service?\"  \nHe looked at me seriously, then he spoke.  \n\"The answers to those questions,\" he said, \"in no particular order, are: yes, yes, no, maybe, and it depends on the complexity of the variables.\"  \nI glared.  \n\"Hey,\" he said, \"I *am* the Overlord of Evil and Darkness,\" he said. \"If I'm not a #BADWORDS#, who will be?\"  \nAnd with a wink and a booming laugh, he stepped into the flames and was gone.  \nSo yeah, like I said: blame Satan for the lack of answers.  \nAll in all, I'd say it was a good experience. It definitely changed my views on things, made me realize that things aren't always as they seem.  \nHonestly, it just goes to show that you really shouldn't generalize. Not all politicians are conniving bloodsuckers. Some are heathen, pagan-rapping cultists who summon Satan in the women's bathroom of a low-end fast-food restaurant.  \nIt's not perfect, not by a long shot. But I'd say it's a step forward.  \nOh, and one last thing: After I left Arby's in a daze, I realized that I had forgotten where I'd parked my car. And in the same instant, I noticed a #BADWORDS#uely Prius-shaped mound of bird poop in a parking spot.  \nSeriously. Watch the #BADWORDS# out for pigeons.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1395873918","downs":0,"edited":"1396119149","gilded":0,"id":"cgcrx9x","link_id":"t3_21fih3","name":"t1_cgcrx9x","parent_id":"t3_21fih3","retrieved_on":1435496603,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":8}

My arms were strapped down to a chair. I must be in the hands of a psychopath. \n\n\"You always were a smart one, tell me, what have you already figured out?\"   \n\nThe voice came behind me, deep, masculine, sarcastically bitter. I did not question how he got in or why I was here. \n\n\"No fun are you? I know you want me to cut down to the chase, but I won't, I know you, Rab.\" \n\nThat was his first mistake, only a few people refer to me as Rab. Ever since my parents gave me the cruel name of Abraham, I neither desired to be referred to as Abe or Ham, instead I ended up stuck with the middle syllable Rab. Which was fine by me, but only my family and my family's friends knew about the nickname. I raked my brain for who it could be.  \n\n\"Ah yes, picking out the candidates? No, I'm not Mr. Yakovich, nor am I your Uncle Zeke, and I'm certainly not Mrs. Gilmore.\" \n\nHow....., this man must be playing tricks on me, either he observed my life from afar or forced the information out of someone I knew. I admired his tactic, though it was cheesy and cliche, it never failed to scare the #BADWORDS# out of people. \n\n\"My god I hate that smug look of yours, I always hated it. Still think you know everything? You missed one person, Rab, you know him.\" \n\nWas he talking about W....no... he couldn't have, he's dead. Then again it has been years, could he have survived? Even if he had, he would not sound this old, nor was he clever with mind games. \n\n\"WILLIAM, you #BADWORDS#-sucker, say the god damn name!\" \n\nA painful blow smacked against the back of my head, I winced. \n\n\"He was your only friend, the only person to put up with your #BADWORDS# and what did you do?\" \n\n\"Will?\" I muttered, wincing from the pain.

This man got hold of my temper, I must not let it happen again. \n\n\"Now we are getting somewhere\" The man said, he stepped in front of me, I could see him. He was beaten, withered like a plant gasping for the last bit of moisture in a baking sun. How could such a voice of power stem from such a shriveled figure, it was impossible to tell whether he was 20 or 40 or 50, the ravishment of agony had eroded all identifiable signs of age, he was just tired now. \n\n\"Tell me, what was it like to hear his last breath?\" \n\n\"Please......\" I begged. \n\n\"Tell me, did you enjoy it?

When you're in the middle of it that kind of routine wears you down over time. You feel like you're cruising along in a rut and any bump or jostle in the road makes you crazy. When you're removed from it,  you start to miss it. I catch myself daydreaming about that life again every day and have to shut it down. I have a new routine now and any bump or jostle will make me crazy.\n\nMy day starts in darkness, laying on a concrete floor on a thin mass of dirty cloth that I used to think of as a blanket. I have no reason to get up, but I have no reason to stay there either, so I get up and feel my way through the empty darkness to the door that leads into the house. It's always locked, but I check it anyway. I also reach down to feel the bit of paper I left jammed underneath the door. It's still there sonobody has come in while I slept (*Good...*).\n\nNow I move to the side of the door and peek through a gap in the boarded up space where a window used to be. There is a clock on the inside wall that I set my watch by. Carefully I wind up my watch, setting it 43 minutes ahead of the other clock.\n\nNow I return to my sleeping space, lie down again, and wait for the sun to come out. Soon my captor will wake up and bring me some food. We'll make small talk until it's time for him to meet his parole officer, like he does every Wednesday (*god I hope it's actually Wednesday*). He'll ask me what time it is, and I'll tell him. I found out early on that he doesn't know how to read a watch or the clock on his wall.  He has no car (*he keeps something else in the garage...*), so he walks to meet the officer every week. Once he realizes he's early it will be too late to walk back and not miss his appointment. That gives me almost 3 hours.\n\n(*I hope it's enough time.*)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1396183135","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cgflp1b","link_id":"t3_21qia9","name":"t1_cgflp1b","parent_id":"t3_21qia9","retrieved_on":1433132270,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Anyone else want to try their luck?\"\n\n**Oh, it was on.**\n\nNext up was a double dragon of fireballs, having just learned that armor was a liability. With the graceful motions of wing chung, the earth mage launched the table splinters forward. Wood vs. Fire sounded like a losing proposition, if one did not know how to harness fire. \n\nShe wore a serene expression as the flaming chips surrounded her. They hissed with superheated gas and left behind sparkling diamond f#BADWORDS#ettes, revealing where her name came from. Stomping her foot down, she palm #BADWORDS#ed forward and peppered the first row with crystal buckshot.\n\nAgain, they learned that armor and fire weren't working. What else was on the priority list for grade-A image #BADWORDS# like them? Lightning! But once again, she had a counter for that: diamond also made an excellent insulator, which she used as a surfboard as she jumped into the crowd. Laymen might fear fire, unable to distinguish between magic as surely as they couldn't distinguish between a killing sword, and a killing axe.\n\nBut she could. It was what she was trained to do.\n\n\"STOP SHOOTING US!\" One of them cried, as a lightning bolt dealt terrible, terrible friendly fire. It struck desks, mesh, and flesh alike. Yet out of ten of them that razed the crowd, it seemed as though only half of them actually did any damage. There was a reason why she didn't wear conductive metals.\n\nFrom beneath the furniture pile came a cloud of steam and a woman's voice, supernaturally clear.\n\n**\"MILLION CARATS!\"**\n\nShe eliminated a third of their numbers with a rising punch, a sonic boom heralding the fast-growing lances. The mages were especially vulnerable, for they had no armor, and their bubble shields never blocked ground attacks. Suddenly, that troperific propensity for hemispheric barriers became a glaring blindspot.\n\nShe stepped over one of their bodies, taking her place back in the middle...but offset slightly, so that dodging direct fire would make them hit their own. She would be safe: once bitten, twice shy after all.\n\n\"I feel warmed up now.

The bitter cold making me shiver as I zipped up my coat, hoping it would be enough to protect me from the chill in the air. The morning was unremarkably gray. \n\nHow long have you been waiting I asked the woman next to me. \n\nWho knows she sighed. \n\nShe shifted the strap of her oversized coach bag to her other shoulder. \n\nHer eyes were tired and void of any spark. She had given up on civility and had obviously been without coffee for sometime now. \n\nI looked back up the road kicking at a rock and shards of glass that caught the morning sunlight. The sun did nothing to warm  my chilled body in the haze of morning clouds as they hung dreary and gray over our heads. It pushed us deeper towards despair but I knew that we both had to move on.\n\nI searched down the street and there was a glint of light off the blue facade as the bus turned the corner and roared towards us will ill intent, possibly no intent at all. no purpose but to move along it’s path as it had done day after day. \nHow much longer will it run once I’m gone I thought to myself not feeling the urge to voice my thoughts with the exhausted woman sharing the sidewalk with me. She will come about the thought on her own or perhaps never at all. The lumbering vehicle screeched up dangerously close to us and I ducked back to avoid getting clipped in the head by it’s oversized mirrors. \n\nAfter you I told the woman as I gestured.\n\nThank you\n\nShe stiffly climbed the bus. \n\nShe moved like an elderly woman in the body of a thirty year old as she supported herself using the handrails. \n\nI too didn’t move as well as I should at my age. Maybe it had been too many days that I’ve stood on the side of the road in the harsh climate that had been the winter waiting for my ride to drag me downtown. I climbed the steps behind her flashing my pass to the man at the wheel of the bus. \n\nGood morning I managed as pleasantly as possible but the words still tasted dry as I said them. \nMorning the man replied back to me. \n\nIt was almost as if he had never seen me, never even saw my bus pass but heard my voice echo to him on the wind. His response was automatic and almost as dry as my greeting. \n\nI walked on towards an empty seat on the bus and I was filled with dread of the day ahead of me. As I sat, my stomach rumbled and ached. I hadn’t eaten since last night and the emptiness that pulled at my stomach made me dizzy. I produced a small bag of pretzels from my backpack. \n\nThis is the only snack I have for the day besides the carrot sticks I thought. I have to conserve them. \nI tentatively nibbled on the salty, crunchy snack to try and stay my hunger as the bus bumbled down the road. Everybody around me stared ahead with heavy bags under their eyes and slouched shoulders. I relented and did the same, after popping a headphone in my ear and turning on an audiobook. \n\nAfter a long jarring ride filled with jerks and shakes from the pockmarked pavement I neared my destination and tugged the dirty yellow cord hanging near my head. The bell sounded and I staggered to the front of the bus as it shuddered to a stop. \n\nThank you I told the driver as I departed onto the streets.\n\nHave a great day he said in a monotone from behind me.\n\nIf that were possible I thought to myself.\n\nI walked in the direction of the rising sun, hoping my destination wasn’t as bleak and jarring as the journey there. \n\nEdit: a period added","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1396383563","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cghl536","link_id":"t3_21x2hf","name":"t1_cghl536","parent_id":"t3_21x2hf","retrieved_on":1433166531,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Vio_","body":"I must have missed the part about \"harsh\" meaning \"harsh,\" especially as I wasn't the only one to comment on the problems of the opening sentence. \n\nHere's a few more things:\n\nA lot of these sentences need to be broken up. They're these overly long, complicated en#BADWORDS#es that are destroying your flow of violence and movement. All semi-colons? Dead. All commas? THEY ARE DEAD TO YOU. Go back, and make everything sentences. Fix them until they read better. Until you get your comma addiction under control, you need to stick to straight sentences.\n\n\nTake out every single adverb. Just slaughter the whole lot of them and start over. Most of the adjectives as well for good measure.\n\nAbsolutely no passive voice. Also try to be consistent with your tenses and make your actions as immediate as possible.\n\n\"Panting was all I did.\"\n\nThis is passive. Gone. Dead. to. you.\n\n\"All I could do was just stand there, panting.\" is maybe acceptable writing. But is at least better than \"Panting was all I did.\"\n\n\nDon't use constructions such as:\n\n\"He did not know this.\" It's clunky to just leave that \"this\" open like that. \"He didn't know this.\" sounds terrible. Instead, spell out exactly what he didn't know.  \"He didn't know this.\" versus \"He didn't know she was cheating on him with his twin sister.\" never, ever end on a \"this.\"\n\n\n\n\nFor these kinds of action scenes, you want short, punctuated sentences that follow a clipped pace. Maybe something with a beat.\n\nSomething akin to this fix:\n\nYours: \n\nFor a moment I flowed instinctually, gravitated towards the smaller man, dashing. I drew an arm forward; a feint, but he did not know this. He grabbed out for where my arm had been; he missed; my arm, repositioned, struck him hard in the temple, followed by a fast kick to his stomach. Lowered and dazed by the hits, I slammed knuckles dead-center on his yet-unaffected temple, twice. \n\nHe crumpled backwards after the second hit. I turned, keeping one arm at my back and one close to my abdomen, the safe storage of my handgun and knife.\n\nMine: \n\n\"I charged the smaller man, feinted forward. \n\nHe grappled out for me. Missed.\n\nI moved with his momentum, then against. Fist striking his head hard. A fast kick to his stomach, quick slammed knuckles dead-center to his temple. \n\nHe crumpled on the second hit.\n\nI pivoted, one arm loose by my back, the other close to my abdomen, readying my handgun and knife.\"\n\nMine's no way perfect, but the short sentence structure keeps the movement flowing. Everything high and tight on the action. Same scene with half the words used.\n\nYou want just enough detail to make it realistic and for people to follow it, but not so much that it bogs the flow of the story. \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1396497786","downs":0,"edited":"1396499670","gilded":0,"id":"cgisgqm","link_id":"t3_221hzc","name":"t1_cgisgqm","parent_id":"t1_cgiqo7w","retrieved_on":1433187484,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"ay1717","body":"The little man leaned back, his face covered in grease and oil and all the dirt you get from working with metal in your own two hands.\n\nHe leaned back from the finishing touches and breathed out. Across the room, the small television was playing, on a loop, the VHS cassette he'd bought late last year. The young boy on the screen was silently assembling pieces of shiny plastic and silver and chrome, a look of utter joy plastered on his face.\n\nThe little man in the small, messy apartment took a glance, on all sides. Wires stuck out from each opening, plates were missing, but it didn't matter. He groped around for the switch across the back and flipped his machine ON.\n\nThe automaton sat u#BADWORDS#ht, as it had been programmed to upon booting. The cold metal eyes flashing a warm red as it initiated its relay scan of the environment.\n\nThe little man smiled, the corners of his cheeks lifting away at the layer of dirt. His eyes were heavy, he wiped his brow with the back of his hand. He watched his robot move its arms, flexing and bending for the first time. He watched like a proud carpenter.\n\nHe spoke aloud in Thai at the bot. The machine turned its head, so as to position its make-believe ears closer to the source of the sound.\n\nAgain the man spoke in Thai, \"How are you today!\"\n\nThe robot grumbled in its metallic voice-box, the sound coming from about chest level through a series of grated speakers. \"I. Am. Well.\"\n\nThe little man nearly whooped and cheered, yet he was so tired. He simply fell back onto his sofa behind him and spread his arms out, stretching. The robot watched for a moment, trying to mimic him. The little man chuckled and gazed at the TV set. He'd probably turn that off soon. But it was nice, this feeling. Being alone, but not. Being satisfied with a piece of work.\n\nHe smiled, stood and walked to the washroom. He needed a break.\n\n\"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.\" He said it as he passed patting the robot on its hard cold steel frame.\n\nThe robot sat and wondered how it could go anywhere, it had no legs.\n\nIt squirmed around for a moment, gazing around the apartment. Its new home. Its eyes wandered to the TV, the little blinking box of images.\n\nIt stared into the screen as the boy from another country and another time pieced together parts of a large automaton. Slowly the boy pulled the final piece back onto the grate of the thing and sat back, miming a sigh and mopping his brow, just as the little man had done.\n\nIf the robot's eyes could widen, it would have done so then. The boy on screen disappeared and the robot from another time and place came into view - it stood u#BADWORDS#ht, in all its glory, large powerful arms coated in shining plastic and metal armour casing, its legs propelling it to an immense height. Its shoulders, covered in chrome. Its eyes and face - a face articulated in emotions.\n\nAnd in the little man's apartment, the little robot watched. The television screen much less a mirror then, but a looking glass.\n\nThe little man, hands still soaked a bit, hair and face still wet, came back into the room. He followed his robot's gaze and stared proudly with him at the TV screen. He smiled even brighter then, his eyes tired, his body and hands aching. His fingers rested on the cold metal cheek.\n\n\"Looks just like you, doesn't it?\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1396570962","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cgjihkg","link_id":"t3_22598n","name":"t1_cgjihkg","parent_id":"t3_22598n","retrieved_on":1433199996,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

It was an air he had spent years carefully cultivating for moments like this; moments when his men could not question his orders.\n\n“Men, Los Angeles has gone dark, and I mean that in every sense of that phrase. Back in the Cold War era, it would have meant that a nuclear bomb had been detonated within the vicinity.” He paused, letting those last words sink in. He wanted these men afraid, he wanted them scared. He had always believed that men who were afraid were sharp, alert, and ready for anything that headed their way. Confident men were the ones who never came home.\n\n“This time, fortunately,” he swept his eyes around the room, watching the relief on their faces when they knew nuclear fallout was not in the equation, “we know that nuclear bombs were not involved. No satellites have detected any activity of that kind. Unfortunately,” and he saw with satisfaction the fear come back to their eyes, “we do not have the first clue what we are up against.  This is where you men come in. We need you to infiltrate the city, and find out what is going on. Now pay attention!”\n\nColonel Jessup spent the next twenty minutes outlining his plan of assault on the city of Los Angeles. It involved sending squads in along separate routes, each one taking a different route into the city. Whatever had happened, stealth was going to be the key to everyone’s survival. No highways, no major roads that could not be helped. One squad would parachute in over Angeles National forest and make their way south; another was going to come in through Santa Monica after getting dropped off at Channel Islands; and the final one was to be dropped off near Long Beach. They would all have long walks, but this would allow for a north-eastern, southern, and western intrusion that make for the best chance of discovery.\n\nSquaring his shoulders up one last time, Colonel Jessup informed everyone that they were now under the command of Captain Jacob Kalu, and he walked back to his tent. He did not like this. There was something about this entire operation that just felt…wrong to him. Los Angeles was a city of over four million people, and not one distress call had been issued. They couldn’t even find evidence of a damned wireless set being left on. Nothing. It was like a nuclear bomb *had* gone off inside the city limits.  He prayed Captain Kalu could find the answers.\n\n**2100 Hours**\n\nCaptain Kalu followed his men as they started coming out of the Angeles National Forest.  As the plane had flown close by, he had looked out the window and seen nothing. It was perfect blackness. When they had parachuted out, it was still perfect blackness. A couple of his men had gotten caught in trees that they had not seen on the way down.\n\nRadio reports from the other squads indicated that they were all starting to reach the edge of the city. So far, they had seen no sign of lights, radio, or even people. There was something else bothering Captain Kalu, but he could not seem to place his finger on it. The whole city just felt eerie. \n\nAs they arrived in the first suburban neighborhood, Kalu ordered several men to enter a household to determine if there were any occupants. Several minutes later they returned, shaking their head. This occurred several more times before they gave up searching houses. Kalu reported this to the other squads, and heard similar results. One had entered a supermarket and found no signs of anyone. The shopping carts were still sitting full of food. Everyone had left in a huge hurry. \n\nFearing now more than ever that something had gone horribly wrong outside of just a power outage or a terrorist attack, Kalu ordered radio silence until they could meet in the center of the city. He selected Pershing Square as it seemed central enough.\n\nThen he realized what had been bothering him. He had not seen a single rat or squirrel, or even a #BADWORDS# pigeon.\n\n**0400 Hours**\n\nThey found it in Pershing Square. Private Billings had been the first to see it. It was a small, rectangular sheet of metal. Captain Kalu turned the metal over in his hands several times without really looking at it, and then he saw it.  Written in large, child-like block letters, like someone who only recently learned English, was one word:\n\n“SUBMIT”","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1396897758","downs":0,"edited":"1396898569","gilded":0,"id":"cgmh29n","link_id":"t3_22g0ei","name":"t1_cgmh29n","parent_id":"t3_22g0ei","retrieved_on":1433251166,"score":27,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":27}

{"archived":true,"author":"pbmonster","body":"His body was failing. He had taken care of it very well, but 205 years were a long time. Not a drop of alcohol all those long and lonely tavern nights, not a crumb of tobacco for the old pipe. He never had indulged in gluttony and he had moved meticulously through his sword forms every morning. Yet there is only so much the human body can take. And even careful maintenance of the flesh will not keep it forever. Two centuries had extracted their toll on their way past him.\n\nAs Mathemer de Troy stumbled up the stairs, unpleasantly lightheaded and painful jolts firing through his hip at every step, he looked up at her face. His vision was bleary and slowly losing focus, but he still could see the fear and concern distort her beautiful features.\n\nShe had been with him so briefly. Little more than 22 years had he had to raise her, teach her, shape her. She had barely been able to read when he first had met her, and now she would pass her Master's defense with flying colors, if any Master would stoop low enough to haze... a woman. Mistress' defense, actually - not that one had happened for half the millennium he remembered.\n\nThe tower fortress was shaken by a shock wave powerful enough to make his ears pop.\n\n\"So much for the front gate, Master de Troy.\" She tried to sound nonchalant, but he still could sense the fear in her. He had only started teaching her to kill... She had mastered the technicalities years ago, but the concept itself still robbed her sleep. Little innocent Lia Smith, eighth daughter of a small-town craftsman.\n\n\"No matter. There is still time, and time is all we need.\"\n\nShe nodded and took him by the hand, pulling him up the last few steps by the remaining three fingers the frostbite had left him with. It was time.\n\nThe laboratory at the top of the tower fortress was in disarray. Half the roof was missing already, and most of his expensive apparatuses were destroyed. It was frightening how much damage only ten minutes of fire from the mercenary artillery mages could do to a building. Cursed bounty hunters... the next volley would take the wall. With a flick from the wrists he raised new shields, and with pride he saw Lia doing the same. She had come so far... \n\nHe heard screaming from the fortress grounds far below. Helmsfire traps or Golem Guard, one of the two was raising the blood price for his head significantly.\n\nIn the center of the room was a contraption of two large chairs, back to back, sharing a single high backrest with a hole in its center. He looked at Lia, smiling sadly. He would miss her company.\n\n\"You stand by your decision?\"\n\nShe tossed her head, sending her long black hair flying.\n\n\"Of course. The deal is much to good. Have any of your old apprentices ever backed out?\"\n\n\"I never asked for their consent, to be honest.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"What made you change your mind this time?\"\n\nHe smiled again, the warmth of his smile ripped away by lips revealing his full adamantine dental plate. \"Maybe remorse. Maybe you are the first apprentice I actually like. Maybe you are to strong to be forced\".\n\nShe smiled as well, then looked away. \"Promise me that my mind will still exist.\"\n\n\"All memories, skills and knowledge - untouched. All character traits, morals and values - merged with mine, dominance lies with the stronger emotion. Magical ability - ac#BADWORDS#ulated. The same is true for everything I am. I will not steal your body, Lia.\"\n\nHe gently took her face between both hands, between the three fingered one on the right and the spring steel driven contraption that replaced his left, and kissed her forehead.\n\n\"I would not consider sacrificing the closest thing I ever had to a daughter just for another century or two. It breaks my heart to change even the little things that I will influence. I promise.\"\n\nShe nodded and wiped away a tear. She took her seat and watched her master use his spring-driven arm to lock her head into place against the hole in the headrest by tightly screwing down a crystal headdress. He touched her face in passing one last time.\n\n\"Good bye, Lia Smith.\"\n\nAs he took his seat behind her, Master Mathemer de Troy regretted not finding another apprentice. Someone closer to his own character, but weaker. Someone he would miss less talking too. Preferably male, for the stronger sword arm, and the quick and painless ascend into the ranks of Masters. But he had never found another as talented and powerful as little Lia. And now the time was out. Life was not always quick an painless...\n\nMentally linking to the apparatus was easy. Linking to Lia proved a lot harder, but once she accepted the link, it was child's play. The transfer took less than the blink of an eye.\n\nEffortlessly burning through the head gear securing her, Lia de Troy rose from the Receiver Chair. Suddenly it all made sense. The long years studying the Arts of Blood and Fire alone, her rising su#BADWORDS#ion that the Master had no idea what the cryptic texts she had to learn from in the old books meant.\n\nIt had been true. For almost a decade, most of what she learned alone had been unknown to Mathemer himself. He did his own study, complementing her work, expecting it to make sense after the Merge. And it did. It was almost... disappointingly easy.\n\nShe walked around the chairs to take a last look at her old Master, sitting slumped and lifeless in his chair. A husk of a man, having lived so long and gone so far. She took his Soulbane Sword, enjoining the new found balance it now had in her hand as she put it on her back, and his magic rings, now fully aware of their power. The rest of her gear, riding dress and high boots, magic staff and night silver hair net, were already far superior to his old and mighty wizard robes. He had not upgraded in almost a decade, focusing on helping her.\n\nThe door splintered with a bang, and putting her eyes on the three bounty hunters in the door way, her first thought was that she now enjoyed taking both men and women into bed. She smiled and drew the Soulbane Blade. What a pity she would have to burn them all.

{"archived":true,"author":"Woodport","body":"\"*To he who has awoken me, three wishes shall I grant,*\" the genie ethereally explained, \"*In a reality that I have changed I can no longer exist, and upon the granting of the third wish I shall disappear from the world forever.*\" Its words sent a chill through my skin, or maybe it was the cold mountain air. The wind whistled around us through the trees. I stared, dumbfounded, and alternated my gaze between the mythical being and John. He returned my shocked gaze. The sun slowly began to slide behind the mountain.\n\n\n\"#BADWORDS# me...\" I spoke quietly at first, \"looks like you're just about the luckiest guy in the universe.\"\n\n\nAfter a few moments of silence John breathed deeply and turned back to the Genie. \"I wish he and I were immortal,\" He wished with complete conviction.\n\n\n\"*It is done,*\" the genie confirmed, \"*two wishes remain.*\"\n\n\n\"Uh,\" I started, unsure how to react, \"thanks I guess? I'm not sure if I wanted to be immortal but I guess I can't leave my best bud to eternity by himself.\"\n\n\n\"Right,\" He answered, \"best bud...\" His eyes couldn't seem to move from the ground. After another pause he turned back to the genie, his mind made up. \"Um... For my second wish... I wish, uhh... I wish he was a girl version of himself.\" He turned to me and I could see the faintest hint of sadness behind his widened eyes.\n\n\nAgain the genie confirmed, \"*It is done, one wish remains.*\"\n\n\nThe words resonated in the darkness and for a second I didn't notice the differences. The shock began to wear off and I noticed that the world seemed just a bit larger than it had been before. I realized that I was shorter or rather, smaller. My clothes felt heavier but not so much as my chest. The fabric of my shirt stretched slightly and my chest felt more sensitive than it had been before. My pants felt loose, and yet they did not fall down due to the wideness of my hips. I reached a hand down, afraid of what I might find. A cursory investigation told me that I was, indeed, a woman now. \"What the #BADWORDS#...\" was all I could manage in the midst of my shock. The near-whisper voice was mine, but it was also that of a girl I had never heard before. I didn't know what else to say. I couldn't fathom the reasons. I couldn't understand... So I stared into his eyes and hoped for an explanation.\n\n\n\"Do you remember when we were kids,\" he explained with his eyes back at the ground, \"and we didn't know any better and we decided that we should get married? At the time, of course, it was because we thought girls were gross. When we told our parents they said that boys aren't supposed to get married and laughed. That always stuck with me though. Even after we realized that girls weren't that gross, I always though you were the only person I could ever be with. I... I guess this just seemed like an opportunity that I had to take advantage of.\"\n\n\nI couldn't believe it. Of course I remembered the story from when we were kids but we had both gotten over that almost immediately. I couldn't believe that that had meant so much to him, let alone that he would wish something like this without even asking me first. \"Y-you,\" my new voice wavered, \" you can't do this to me. I didn't ask for this. You have to change me back John. We can't be together like that. Your my best friend and I love you... but not like this. You should have asked me first. You should have told me this before... I can't be like this...\" His first wish resurfaced in the turmoil of my thoughts. \"I can't be like this forever.\"\n\n\n\"Why not?\" he asked, suddenly firm in his resolve. \"Why can't we stay like this forever. This is perfect. This is what I've truly always wanted. Please, please agree to this.\"\n\n\nI thought about it for a moment. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Being a girl couldn't be that much different from being a guy. But... In the end it wouldn't feel right. I just couldn't be what he wanted me to be. I couldn't think of him that way. My own resolve hardened and my thoughts solidified. \"No. I can't be like this John. You have to reverse this. We have to go back to the way things are supposed to be.\"\n\n\nHis eyes teared up and I knew that he understood. \"Okay,\" he whispered. His jaw clenched. He turned back to the genie. \"For my third wish,\" he began, \"I wish... I wish he... she... would always obey me.\" The words bit into my stomach and I felt it twist and knot. I was shocked when the magical being had appeared and I was shocked when I found I was a girl, but nothing compared to the sense of dread that electrocuted every inch of my body.\n\n\n\"No,\" I managed, weakly, but it was too late.\n\n\n\"*It is done.*\" The words mixed with the wind and cut deeper than any knife. The genie was already gone but the words remained. The betrayal of our friendship seemed almost mild compared to the eternity I now faced.\n\n\n\"Let's go, it's getting dark,\" John told me.\n\n\n\"Okay,\" I whispered pitifully, but dutifully nonetheless. The tears streamed down my face.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1397282615","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cgqf9r4","link_id":"t3_22s5df","name":"t1_cgqf9r4","parent_id":"t3_22s5df","retrieved_on":1433320308,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

At least I didn’t follow George’s decision to drink caffeine during that first wave of darkness. Once he started to crash he made himself a coffee. He added two tables#BADWORDS#s of 2% milk, a quarter packet of Splenda, and a half scoop from the Nestle Hot Coco mix. I have seen him make that same concoction 9 times since. Or was it 10?

Before you go around thinking that these thoughts were his own.\n\nJohannes glanced left. He glanced right. Subtlety, he always maintained, was the key. ‘I did it!’ the voice rung out again. Johannes couldn’t quite see everyone, as he had won the dubious honour of front row seating at this particular funeral.

{"archived":true,"author":"lawyr","body":"I remember as a child I used to use it to place myself in the position of my favorite superheroes.  Flying around the city as Superman, fighting criminals who were robbing banks and holding innocent people hostage seemed to never get old.  The thing about that room is, everything that you experience inside of it seems very real.  The wind against my face as I flew around, the vertigo that came with looking down when I was several miles in the air, the impact of the punches on the bad guys’ faces, to me it was all very real.\n\nLater in life, around 8th grade, I used it to make out with the girls that I had crushes on.  In real life if I tried to pursue them I would always get turned down.  I can’t really blame them, though.  In every way I was remarkably average.  There were no sports that I was good at, there were no school subjects that I excelled at, my looks were nothing special, and my family wasn’t super rich.  I remember Annie, the girl who sat next to me in freshman math and history.  She was super hot.  All the guys in my grade would try so hard just to have a casual conversation with her, but she normally just stuck with her elite group of friends.  That didn’t stop me from having sexual encounters with her in my VR room.  From freshman to junior year of school, pretty much every night it was just me and Annie in some luxury hotel room with a Jacuzzi hot tub or in some #BADWORDS# scene together, going at it for hours.  My parents decided that I was spending way too much time in the room after two weeks straight of cutting class and cutting soccer practice to stow myself away with Annie.  They had shut down my room until the day I left for college, and I always resented them for it.\n\nDuring my stay at university, I can’t say I really made many friends or enjoyed many of the classes I was taking.  I had landed in my major due to how easy it was to get by, despite it requiring grad school education to land any sort of respectful career.  The dorms came with a VR room that was separate for each roommate.  Most of my freshman and sop#BADWORDS#re year, all my extra time outside of class and sleep was spent in the room, doing all the things that I wish I could do like skydive or skateboard like the pros in the X-games.  For one month I was a professional hockey player with the largest contract in the league, leading my team in points and setting records left and right.  Another month I was a famous movie actor, beloved by everyone who had seen any of my movies.  My worlds became more and more intricate as I added the smallest details to make myself believe that this was actually my reality.  In these worlds, I wasn’t some average nobody with a skinny-fat complexion and a left arm that was a half inch shorter than my right.  I was anyone that I believed I could be, just like all that propaganda they fed to us as children.  All the posters in my primary education classrooms saying stupid meaningless stuff like “You can be anything you want if you put your mind to it!”  No.  You couldn’t.  The only way you could be anything you wanted was if you had a VR room.  I pitied the lower class for not being able to afford this wonderful luxury, they had to endure the harsh reality of barely scraping by with their government supplied welfare check.  They couldn’t escape like I could.  Thinking about this only made my worlds more and more intricate.\n\nAfter months of looking for some form of employment, I finally was able to land a desk job handling the paperwork that came from the engineers that had to be sorted and approved for corporate a few states away.  It didn’t pay well, but after a few years I was able to move out of my parents’ house into a small place of my own and buy my own crappy little sedan that barely got me from home to work.  The yard was small and filled with crabgrass, surrounded by a rusted wired fence, and the house was a one bedroom #BADWORDS#alow with one bathroom that had a shower so small I could barely fit my fat self in it.  The best part, though, was the VR room.  I had it custom installed with a lot of the money I had acquired over the past few years.  The technology had improved, and the sensations of the VR room were completely indiscernible from the real world.  Tastes had a lingering effect, and if I wasn’t careful enough I would skip meals in the real world since my body had thought I had eaten already.  My wife in world six was a supermodel, and we had a mansion in the valleys of Wyoming with two dogs and a tennis court in the backyard.  That’s where I spent most of my time, since I had worked on constructing that world for several years at my parents’ house before I moved out.  I’d say about ten hours a day were spent in the VR room, eight or nine of those hours specifically dedicated to world six.  I missed most of my parents’ calls since there was only a thirty minute window of every day that I was accessible by phone.\n\nIt took my mom four days to reach me to tell me that my dad had passed away.  I guess I never checked the voicemail.\n\nAfter working at the office for thirty-eight years, I was eligible for retirement despite my 401K having nearly nothing in it.  I would always spend my paychecks on microwavable meals and upgrades for the VR room.  The latest installment was time dilation, so one minute in the real world was an hour in the VR room.  That cost me about two years of pay, putting me into some serious debt, but I didn’t care, that world wasn’t real to me anymore.  In world six, I was young, fit, and had an entire world and working economy built.  I don’t remember the last time I checked the hours I spent on it, but it was somewhere near 20,000.  And with the latest upgrade, I could more time there than ever before.\n\nBy the time I had turned 75, I began to notice blood coming out of my mouth when I coughed. I guess it didn’t faze me too much, since it was about three real world months before I went to the doctor.  \n\nIt’s a real sobering sentence to hear when the man in the white coat tells you that you only have six months left to live.  It makes you reflect on all you’ve done and all you have left to do.  I had to family or friends to fall back on when I cried myself to sleep every night.\n\nI woke up to ho#BADWORDS#e care taking my vitals and asking me how I was feeling.  They administered their pain medications and some other drugs that might extend my life by two weeks if I’m lucky, and then they left.  I clawed out of bed to my wheelchair, clutching my IV stand as I wheeled my way out of my bedroom and to my VR room.  World six’s file sat on the touchscreen panel, beckoning me to join my wife at our lovely Wyoming ranch.  I swiped the screen to the side to create a new world.  With the last of my money, I was able to buy the latest time dilation extension, making every minute in the real world a day in the VR room.  \n\nI opened up my eyes to greet the new fresh world.  I climbed out of my race car bed, wearing my Spiderman pajamas and ran to my cupboard to get some real clothes on.  It was a summer day at my childhood house, a high of 82 degrees.  I ran out of the front door and was met by the warm rays of the morning sun peering over my neighbor’s house.  All the friends I had as a young child simultaneously ran outside, and we played kickball in the street.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1397751100","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cguxe0n","link_id":"t3_239tc8","name":"t1_cguxe0n","parent_id":"t3_239tc8","retrieved_on":1433398153,"score":21,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":21}

{"archived":true,"author":"Dysprosium_164","body":"If there was one thing that he knew, it was that she was beautiful. Sometimes her hair caught in the light of the setting sun, as she stared wistfully at the ocean. Other times her sundress would ripple in the gentle sea breeze, and she would gather a handful of it, a simple gesture meant only to comfort herself.\n\n\nHe could only observe, of course, because his ashes had been so carefully scattered at the top of the cliff, where he had spent many an evening with old friends, laughing and smiling and doing so very little that he couldn't help but think the entirety of his life had been somewhat wasted. So it had been a relief, to be sure, when he had realised that he wasn't set to leave this plane for some time, and could follow wherever his remains lay. Of course, some of them stayed in that infernal crematorium, and he wasn't quite ready to return there, no thank you.\n\n\nSo after a couple of weeks painfully watching his family repair their broken hearts, he was left by friend and relative alike atop this point, which they so rarely visited any more, not that he could blame them. Soon after this sudden change of location the madness had started to set in, and that was when he had first seen her, wandering the beach. She wasn't always there, but when she was, it was his only respite from the reality of his immortal fate. When he saw her, suddenly things didn't seem so bad.\n\n\nOh, apart from the fact that he couldn't go down there. The ash on the cliff top had either been blown away or had settled into the soil, leaving him with few options as to his location. The other pieces had (as is so often the case) ended up in the sea, which wasn't his first choice for a final resting place.\n\n\nAnd so he waited. He thought with momentary panic that she might stop coming, or that she might not be able to see him, but the simple fact was that thinking would drive him insane, so he didn't. Even as the seasons colours shifted, and cars passed by like blurs of light and sound, he willed himself towards her, consequences be damned.\n\n\nIt was on a rainy night several years later that part of the cliff collapsed, sending some of the soil containing him down to the beach. After a moment of skyward thanks, he materialised at the bottom to see the white sundress he had fixated upon. She turned to face him, and beamed such that he thought the sun had made a surprise appearance.\n\n\"Ah, I was wondering when your would make your way down here,\" She remarked in a delicate tone that reminded him of a spring breeze and the colour green.\n\n\"Well,\" he managed, \"I've been stuck on that cliff for so long, I was afraid you might have left,\"\n\nShe laughed brightly, and replied, \"I guess I could have, seeing as I'm all along this beach and far out to sea by now. There might even be some of me on foreign shores, for all I know!\"\n\n\"So why didn't you? Leave, that is?\"\n\nShe smiled again, and if he'd had a heart, it would have fluttered.\n\n\"Why, because I wanted to meet you!

Like a smoked fish crisped to perfection and lain upon a leafy arugula bed, the open eyes that stared blankly back at me served less as an affirmation that the dead animal was once alive, but more of a reassurance that the job was done in a quality way. This was, of course, emphasized by the bloodlessness. Though an autopsy would reveal death through asphyxiation, the greyish skin that now hung limply over her bones had no purple or red marks--no marks at all barring the gentle smattering of freckles over the bridge of her nose and down into the neck of her unbuttoned button-up. Yes, she is in a better place now, her family would say. But looking at her nails, the beds utterly neglected and the tips chewed or picked into grotesque jagged lines, I venture a guess that wherever she is now is no better than the hell-hole that she lived in before.

{"archived":true,"author":"unspecifiedcarnage","body":"Not posted here before, but I'm bored so why not?\n\nDCI Amanda Hines put down the newspaper on her coffee table with a sigh. The headline; ‘Carnival Killer strikes again: masked maniac continues his murder spree’, was positioned above an article detailing the latest, the tenth, murder committed by the clown-masked killer currently terrorising the city. She hated that name. It had been coined by the tabloids in a crass move to sell more papers, and had stuck; and now the general public were terrified. She looked down at the artist’s impression of the ‘Carnival Killer’; it wasn't even close. CCTV footage from the crime scenes had been restricted to police viewings only, and at least she could be sure that none of it had leaked, judging by the accuracy of the picture in front of her.\n\nA specialist on serial killers, she had been put on the case a few weeks after the first murder, when it had become clear that the killer was quite a bit more sophisticated than was first thought. None of the nine previous crime scenes had yielded any forensic evidence, and leads on both the mask and the car that had been seen leaving four of the scenes had dried up. This was a maniac who knew what they were doing, Amanda thought with a smile. Her superiors were starting to get anxious because, even with her expertise, they were seemingly no closer to cracking the case. However, they had just had a breakthrough. The forensic team had finally found some DNA evidence at the most recent scene that pointed to a convicted killer who had been released from prison only days before the first murder. The perfect suspect, she mused.\n\nShe wondered if he was too perfect. Collecting and planting the evidence had been so easy, and she worried that it was all going to come crashing down around her. But no, she had covered every angle, the guy looked as guilty as hell, there was no way he could get away with it. His conviction would go down as another gold star in her already glowing record, and probably earn her another promotion. She stood up from the couch and crossed her living room to the door that lead out of her apartment. Just one more, she thought. One more with another bit of evidence pointing to him and she would be home and dry. Amanda picked up the bag that was on the table next to the door. Unzipping it, she checked the contents. The grinning visage of the clown mask looked up at her, and, for a brief moment, she wondered who would soon be seeing that terrifying grimace staring down on them as their last breath left their body. It really didn't look anything like picture in the paper…\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398225092","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cgzn48w","link_id":"t3_23pxux","name":"t1_cgzn48w","parent_id":"t3_23pxux","retrieved_on":1433479647,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"Dimitri1033","author_flair_text":"/r/AbnormalTales","body":"The nursing home room was cold and the blanket covering Lance did little to keep him warm. He was a bit confused as to why he was in the room but the television set mounted on the wall was great at distracting him. There was a woman on the screen, young and happy. She was singing to a child, her voice rising and falling in a melody that made Lance smile his old toothless smile. The woman on the television reminded him of a young lady he loved dearly; he couldn't remember if it was his granddaughter, or maybe it was his daughter? \n\nThe more he tried to remember, the more his head hurt. He shook his head to try and rid the thought. Looking to his left, he spotted a juice box with a bright red apple printed on it. Lance reached for it, sighing when he saw that his wrinkled hand couldn't reach it. \n\nHe reached back up to his shoulder where the nurse call button had been. With a slight press, the button glowed a deep shade of red. Lance waited, and eventually his regular nurse, Loretta, walked in, shutting the door behind her. \n\n\"Everything okay Lance?\"\n\n\"Uhh, yeah, I just, sorry to bother you, I just can't reach my juice,\" Lance said, pointing a crooked finger to the juice box. \n\nLoretta smiled and walked over to his other side. \"Oh, it's no biggie dear, here you go,\" she said as she handed him the box. \"You need me to poke the straw in?\"\n\n\"Oh no, I should at least be able to do that,\" Lance said. \n\n\"Okay,\" Loretta said, smiling. \"Do you need anything else?\"\n\nLance looked back to the television where the woman was still singing on screen. Lance smiled and pointed, \"Yes, that woman reminds me of someone. Do I have a granddaughter?\"\n\nLoretta turned and looked, \"Yeah you do, but she is still a toddler. Maybe that woman is reminding you of your daughter?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's probably right,\" Lance said, finally managing to poke his straw through the juice box. He had pressed too hard though; the straw went through the bottom of the box, spilling juice all over his hospital gown. \n\n\"Oh darnit,\" Lance whispered. \n\n\"Oh, I'll get you another one Lance, and I'll send in Gus to come change you,\" Loretta said.\n\n\"Don't worry about it Loretta, I'll be alright,\" Lance said, waving off Loretta.\n\nLoretta frowned. \"Lance, you're appointment is in 5 minutes. Are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nLance looked back to Loretta, a confused look sprawled on his face. \"An appointment? With who?\"\n\n\"I figured this was a bad idea,\" Loretta whispered. \"Lance, I'm not sure if you should-\n\nLoretta was interrupted by a knock on the door. She rubbed her hands together, turned, and opened the door. There was a male nurse standing at the doorway, probably Gus, Lance wasn't sure. \n\nHe couldn't remember what Gus looked like. He sometimes had trouble remembering what Loretta looked like. He had completely forgotten what his wife looked like. He often dreamt of what his daughter looked like, but with each dream, her appearance changed. It frustrated him to no end that he couldn't remember his own daughter's face, but none of that mattered. At least it wouldn't matter anymore soon. \n\n\"I don't know,\" Loretta whispered to who was probably Gus. \n\n\"Well, let him see her. It'll probably jump start his memory,\" the male nurse said.\n\n\"Fine,\" she said as she stepped to the side, pulling the door wide open. \n\nLance watched as the male nurse pushed in a young girl sitting in a wheelchair. She was no more than 6 years old. She had bright blue eyes and a glittery golden star sticker stuck on her left cheek. She used to have curly blonde hair, but the chemo had taken it away.\n\nLance immediately recognized her and smiled. \"Hello Delaney,\" he spoke. \n\nDelaney smiled but said nothing.\n\n\"Don't be shy,\" Lance said, \"go on,\" he continued, gesturing to the nurses, \"push her closer.\"\n\nLoretta looked at the male nurse and nodded. He pushed Delaney closer to Lance. \n\nLance reached an old hand out, beckoning for the young girl's hand. \n\n\"Lance,\" Loretta quickly spoke out, \"are you sure about this? Are you cognitive enough to make such a decision?\"\n\nLance smiled, \"Of course I am Loretta.\" \n\nDelaney placed her hand in Lance's. She squeezed tightly. \n\n\"You're not going to be sick anymore,\" Lance whispered.

He propped himself against the splintery wooden wall of the wagon in vain attempts to get comfortable.\n\nThe train rocked from side to side on the old rails as he told her of his life. He'd been a carpenter until the recession took his job and the bank took his home and his wife took the dog and broke his heart on the way out. He said that with a small smile, as if it was all for the better. He'd been a traveller ever since.\n\nShe sipped the beer - it tasted rather like one of the less pleasant smells in the wagon - and told him her problems were nothing next to his. He chuckled and told her no problems were nothing. She told him her mother wanted her to go to college but she didn't want to. She wanted to live freely. He nodded gravely and told her how he had to pull his own teeth when they rotted. She told him he should eat better and he agreed.\n\nThen there was silence until she said that she wanted to be a carpenter as well. He said that he was no carpenter but she insisted that that was what she wanted. He shook his head gently and said that she should do whatever made her happy, not what some miserable old drunk told her that he'd done when times were better. She said that had nothing to do with it. He sighed and said nothing.\n\nSome time after the train stopped, once they were sure nobody was near the wagon, they helped each other pull the door open. He gave her the rest of his beer and said he was quitting. She told him good for you and beamed at him. He kissed her cheek, which crossed a line, and wished her good luck with bright eyes. Then he crossed the rails and sprinted to intercept the front end of the next train with his face.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398335631","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ch0pmdn","link_id":"t3_23udfu","name":"t1_ch0pmdn","parent_id":"t3_23udfu","retrieved_on":1433498069,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

The bracelet read 5:45, his watch reads 5:43.  \nHe has had a rough romantic campaign for much of his life, and for the past five years he had been alone.  \n*An old man, now. But still a romantic* he thought, a light smile on his face. The broken hearts and disappointments of yesteryears hardly seemed to matter now and he felt an anticipation swell in his stomach that made him feel young.  \nThere was one minute left and no one was approaching him. His palms were freezing and sweating, and his heart was acting up again.  \n*Did I have to be somewhere else?*  \n5:45:00. There was no one here. *Any minute now*. His heart was in agony now, but he didn't mind. He just needed to last the minute. He wanted to see her, he wanted merely to see her, a love that evaded him for all his life. A justification for his life of suffering and his wounds. A destination to his eternal journey. One minute was easy, he could do it. Yes he could do it.  \nWhen the old man fell upon his back and passersby surrounded him, he searched their faces. But between the concerned visages darkened by some dreadful shade, in the slither of the blue, blue sky so bright, was a bird. No, a plane. He stared at the plane and watched it fly away. His fingers feeble and barely able to move. Was it disappointment he felt? Or relief? The plane was gone now and it was 5:46. He wept.

{"archived":true,"author":"77_beers","body":"His very first memory is rolling over on that scratchy living room rug and staring into the depths of her blue eyes. They were three.\n\nNow, Jon stared across at Mary in a very different living room twenty years later, maybe even on the exact same spring day. Since that day, they had been each other’s constant support system; they had laughed together and cried together, learned together and fought together, bickered, smiled, and played together. Siblings often form close bonds but as twins, Jon and Mary were inseparable.\n\nNevertheless, Jon had always harbored the most infinitesimal feelings that something did not quite add up. Maybe it was the red hair and blue eyes in comparison to his dark brown and hazel, his dark skin in contrast with her placid paleness. Or maybe it was the subtle comments that their parents made every once in a while. All of it was easily dismissed and forgotten but now, now Jon could not stop thinking back on each of those moments. Nothing would ever be the same.\n\nIt was like a bomb had exploded inside Jon’s mind. Shrapnel filled thoughts shooting every which way; Jon felt as he no longer had any conception of right and wrong. His brain could not process this new piece of information that had shattered everything he had known in life.\n\nHis sister was adopted.\n\nHe said it again to himself while he looked across the room at her. It was like he was meeting her for the very first time. Inspecting each feature carefully, no longer looking upon her as simply an extreme genetic variation of himself.\n\nShe was truly beautiful. Her long ginger hair curled and fell just above her waist. High cheek bones were complimented by an array of freckles like various constellations in a clear night sky. Her polka dotted sun dress revealed slender legs. And those blue eyes, like staring into a peaceful soothing ocean. \n\nHer face carried the same bemused look that Jon had seen so many times before when she was lost in thought. He wondered what she was thinking, neither of them had said a word since the news had trembled their world. She couldn’t be thinking the same things he was, could she?\n\n“I, ------“\n\nHe broke the silence but only for a second. Jon had said that all-powerful three word phrase a million times to her but he could not muster it now. How would she react? It was altogether a preposterous notion. She would see right through him, she would understand his true meaning.\n\n“I love you too.”\n\nHer blue eyes calmed him.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398541736","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ch2rb0t","link_id":"t3_241al2","name":"t1_ch2rb0t","parent_id":"t3_241al2","retrieved_on":1433533396,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

Look there are even flowers blooming in the tall grass!\"\n\nShawn was still unloading the surveillance equipment as per protocol, but Deborah was never truly that disciplined.\n\n\"Don't wander to far from the ship Deborah, even if the terra prompt said this planet can sustain human life we don't know what could harm us.\"\n\n\"But look at it Shawn! This is stuff out of the old fairy tales!\"\n\nGiving no second thought, she continued running to the top of the tallest hill. Everything about her just seemed to fit the place all to well. The way her hair caressed the wind, her eyes gleaming brighter than the water's reflection, it was like it was made for her.\n\nBy the time he set up the equipment his back was screaming for the chance to lie down. Giving in to temptation he let go of his balance and collapsed backwards into a short patch of grass.\n\n\"This is almost too good to be true,\" he thought to himself. The odds for a habitable planet were supposedly 3 in 507,130. Yet here they were, the first humans to breathe on this planet. 12 years they've been searching to help with the overpopulation of earth. 12 years of cramped companionship without ever confessing his feelings. \n\nI tell ya, it wears a guy down.\n\nSoon a series of beeps and clicks went off from the equipment, and it was back to business. The sensors detected an almost exact match to Earth's atmosphere within it's healthier days. However the gravity was not as strong, which explained the massive towers of rock shooting out from the ground. \n\nDeborah came running back and jumped onto his shoulders. The sudden contact made his blood rush, yet dared not to lose this moment.\n\n\"Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?\"\n\n\"Only once.\"\n\nShe slipped off his back and gestured her arms towards what he thought was the planet itself.\n\n\"Oh c'mon! There can't be anything as breathtaking as this.\"\n\nHe gave a weak smile and replied, \"I can think of only one thing.\"\n\nShe tried to press the answer further but he made sure to avoid the topic. the results were already sent to the E.U. Headquarters for analysis. That's when the monitor began to display a very weak and fragmented recording.\n\n\"Congratulations. Your vessel is the first to discover humanity's next great journey.\"\n\nMore like conflict.\n\n\"Please plant the flag given to you by your Congressional leader.\"\n\nHe had already attached the blue and white streaked flag to the #BADWORDS#anium pole. With one grand #BADWORDS# he wedged it into the ground, which was surprisingly softer than any soil he had ever felt before.\n\n\"With that, this planet has been claimed under the European Union; as per regulation 1 of the Global Colonization Act.\"\n\nHe knew what it really meant though. A land grab made by just one faction and the billions of humans looking for a new home. He knew more would come, and with them more flags to litter the horizon.\n\nDeborah gazed at the flag for quite some time, until she commented, \"It matches the sky.\"\n\nHe didn't see what she saw. But he did know that to whoever discovers a habitable planet, is rewarded with their choice of a substantial part of land. With whoever, wherever, and however they want it to look. All he could see was the two story house, with white paint, dark blue shutters, large bay windows, and a brick chimney for those cold nights. Where every day he would cross the gate that sheltered the sprawling fields, be greeted by his two dogs and bubbling children; all begging him to play. \n\nAt the end however would be Deborah, with the same smile of adventure she had when they first set off to find a new home.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398568589","downs":0,"edited":"1398576362","gilded":0,"id":"ch31gzo","link_id":"t3_240hbw","name":"t1_ch31gzo","parent_id":"t3_240hbw","retrieved_on":1433538252,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

But even more incredulous, he thought he saw buildings. \n\nThe man rubbed his eyes once, twice, another time for good measure, but the land mass and, more amazingly, the buildings, remained in sight. \"No goddamn way. No. #BADWORDS#. Way. Hahahahahah!!!!\" The man cackled to himself, feeling truly insane as he often did during the course of his ill-fortuned journey. This time, though, there was no mirage, only an actual island - no, bigger than just an island - on the horizon. \n\nAs the man grew increasingly close, his eyes continued to widen, and he couldn't believed that they weren't deceiving him. For it truly wasn't some small, uncharted island, he had stumbled across a huge land mass, seemingly fully inhabited, judging by the skysc#BADWORDS#s and industrial smog that he saw increasingly clearer as he grew closer. \n\nThe man had departed originally on a fishing trip that was only supposed to last a few days, but he had wandered off course, lost in an unexpected storm. His boat had been mostly destroyed; at this point the man had only a small, makeshift wooden raft that served as the only remnant of the boat he began his trek on. Since then, he had barely been surviving, his flesh was emaciated, sunken into his bones; when he looked in the rippling reflection of the water, he could barely recognize himself. Hope had never really seemed like possible - especially in the last few weeks, the man assumed that he would serve out the rest of his miserable life drifting along the ocean's harsh waves. \n\nNow, suddenly, he had real, substantial hope. He closed his eyes to sleep that night feeling truly lucky for the first time in ages. When he awoke, he judged how much farther along he had traveled in relation to the land mass. At this rate, it would only be a week or so until he was among the living again. He only had to hold out that much longer.\n\nFinally, after what felt like the longest week of his life, the man drifted into shore. As he approached, though, a voice rang loud over some sort of intercom.\n\n\"IDENTIFY YOURSELF!\", the booming voice commanded. The man had not addressed another human being in two months, and he was temporarily stunned.\n\n\"YOU! DID YOU HEAR ME? IDENTIFY YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY, OR YOU WILL BE SHOT BEFORE YOU REACH THE SHORE!\"\n\nFinally, the man regained some semblance of composure, enough at least to hastily reply, \"H-hold on! Please, don't shoot! M-my name is Hunter, Hunter Snider! I've been lost at sea!\"\n\n\"VERY WELL, HUNTER. YOU WILL BE REELED IN AND TREATED FOR ANY WOUNDS YOU HAVE SUSTAINED, THEN YOU WILL BE DETAINED AND QUESTIONED FOR SOME TIME UNTIL WE HAVE ASCERTAINED THE THREAT LEVEL YOU PRESENT. REMAIN CALM AND COOPERATE.\"\n\nThe voice was unlike any Hunter had ever heard before. When the man spoke over the intercom, Hunter noted traces of certain accents, but he couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was. Nevertheless, it was merely a passing thought in his mind, as Hunter was much more concerned with passing the trials that he was about to be presented with.\n\nHunter was reeled in, as promised, presented with a blanket to keep warm, and guided into an SUV. Several people talked to him along the way, but Hunter wasn't giving them his full attention, he was looking around, marveling at the architecture of this civilization, wondering where in the world he was. After a short drive, the driver of the SUV parked, and then guided Hunter into one of the biggest skysc#BADWORDS#s he'd ever seen - it was labeled \"PANGEA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\".\n\n\"Pangea? That was the name for the huge land mass, back when all the continents were fused together, before they separated, right? That's not a real thing anymore..\" Hunter mused aloud, hoping for some clarity into his whereabouts. \n\n\"That's not for me to tell you, there are people here with a specific job for that, they'll fill you in on what this place is,\" the SUV driver said. \"And here we go, this is your stop. Just walk through this door and you'll be greeted by someone who can help you.\"\n\n\"T-thank you\" Hunter mumbled, confused. He stepped through the door - an automatic, shiny one, at that - and found himself greeted by a woman in very formal business attire. \n\n\"Welcome, Mr. Snider. Please, take a seat. We have a lot of questions to ask of you, and then we'll do our best to get you filled in and acclimated to life here at Pangea.\" The woman spoke with a kind tenderness to her voice, but Hunter still felt unsettled and slightly out of place in the room, which was only furnished with a single table, a chair at each end. The walls were barren, and the dim, singular light that hung over them couldn't help but make Hunter feel like he was in an interrogation room.\n\nAfter answering standard questions about who he was, where he was from, and how he had wound up at Pangea, the woman was ready to give Hunter some clarity.\n\n\"Thank you very much for your responses, Mr. Snider, your openness with us will not go unnoticed, and your expedition of the process will make both of our jobs much easier.\" The woman smiled, she seemed genuinely happy about the state of the meeting thus far.\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Hunter said; he felt more at ease with the woman now, she seemed kind and like she really wanted to help. \"Please, can you tell me where and what this place is? I know you guys call it Pangea, but I'm not sure what that means. And where in the world am I? I came from America, so it's got to be one of the other continents.\"\n\n\"Pangea is actually an eighth continent, in its own right. Well, I guess ninth if you consider the Indian subcontinent. Anyway, in order to get you started on the acclimation process faster, I'll try to summarize this as succinctly as possible.\"\n\n\"What? You're kidding, right? There's no eighth continent. You're trying to pull a fast one on me, huh? Nice, but I won't fall for that,\" Hunter chuckled as he spoke, but the woman's demeanor told him that it truly wasn't a joke.\n\n\"No, Mr. Snider, Pangea is very real. You see, a long time ago, this land mass, a small continent that we now refer to as Pangea, was found by explorers from various nations during a relatively similar window of time. At first, those nations fought over who rightfully owned Pangea, but the promise of a new continent was simply too grand for any nation to back down, and the fighting drew closer to a stalemate every day. A peace accord was signed by those nations during the early 20th century. Part of that deal - the founding of a new settlement by the member nations. However, what the founders of Pangea foresaw as being of utmost importance was the unity of the new continent, and thus all settlers of the new continent shed their old nationalities and became one community, a new continent governed cons#BADWORDS#utionally by a diverse people. You see, Pangea was the most progressive place on Earth then, and it still is.\"\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398663239","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ch3xkbq","link_id":"t3_245kiy","name":"t1_ch3xkbq","parent_id":"t3_245kiy","retrieved_on":1433553702,"score":31,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":31}

I started to wake her, but reconsidered when I thought about the repercussions of her being startled awake by me.\n\n\n'Instead, I threw back the cover slid into my bathrobe, so as to not startle the neighbors with my naked visage at five in the morning.  Being at the end of a cul-de-sac has its advantages; nude paper-getting, however, draws unwanted attention.\n\n\n'Finally reaching my front door, I opened the house to the morning dew-covered lawn to see what, at-first, appeared to be one of those portable-on-demand storage units.  I was taken aback for a moment; had my wife ordered a POD because she was leaving me and moving out?\n\n\n'Assuring myself I was just insecure, I decided to further inspect the rather large box now parked on the lawn.  As I ventured further out, my attention was drawn to the sky and to a silver bullet-shaped aircraft whose speedy exit drew the clouds in behind its blue-tinted engine array.  \n\n\n'Of course I was aware of military vehicles, but this was too fancy and too high-tech looking to be ours.  But was it just too early?  Was my late night alcohol ingestion to cause for this, or was I experiencing a residual high from Tom's bachelor party and those mushrooms two nights ago.\n\n\n'Nah.\n\n\n'When my bare feet reached the dew-dampened Bermuda grass, soaking between my toes, I saw steam rising up from the vaporizing water against the heated metal base.  I also saw that the side of what I once believed was a POD was actually a heat-scorched metal with a digital, ever-changing display on the side.  I leaned in and verbally asked myself “What the hell?”\n\n\n'Then the box made a glitch chime, said “english,” then the display changed to an address.  What I read on the side of the box, then, was Planet Aerth, Sector 2317, Milky Way.  Shocked, imagining this as some sort of prank, I began trying to ascertain the contents of the giant metal box.  I started by walking circles around the box, then knocking on the metal.\n\n\n'The response to my knocks was a horrifying growl, followed by incessant scratching, clawing and then purrs.\n\n\n'From my judgment, I guessed that the box was ten feet tall, maybe five feet wide, and it began rocking back and forth from the creature or whatever banging on the inside walls of the box.  I saw what I thought was a handle to open the box, and in my, I guess, curiosity, opened the box and was knocked aside by two very, very large cats.  Cat lizards.  Lizard cats.\n\n\n'They licked me on the face after a few seconds of being out, I'm not sure why.  Then they ran off around the neighborhood.”  I finished my story and folded my hands in front of me, nodding, staring into the face of an Aviator-sunglasses-obscured General.\n\n\nThe General looked back at me from behind those sunglasses and grunted and then let the very Southern-accent heavy words roll out of his mouth “So, yer telling me that these alien life forms that are now terrorizing the outer suburban streets of this town are your pets?”\n\n\nConfused, I looked at him.  “It was a wrong address, man... I can't help it that the intergalactic Fed Ex can't figure out what *planet* they're dropping their packages on.”\n\n\nAngry, the General stood up and began to storm out of the room only to be met with an aide who nearly hit the General in the face with the door.  “Sir!  They've had a litter of... they've bred.  And the death toll is up to six-hundred.  They seem to be killing their way through the outer city limits, but they move too fast for us to hit or catch.  Intelligence thinks they're looking for someone.”\n\n\nThe General and the Aide both looked directly at me.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: To correct formatting issues from a copy/paste from Open Office. -.-","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398796017","downs":0,"edited":"1398796292","gilded":0,"id":"ch58hv5","link_id":"t3_24a84j","name":"t1_ch58hv5","parent_id":"t3_24a84j","retrieved_on":1433576217,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

Bring your family down to your local MRP.\"\n\nNo explanation of what an MRP was or where the hell they had come from. One morning, they were just.... There.\n\nRey looked around as they shuffled forwards in regular increments. Most families were in excess of five people despite constant government reminders that sanctions would be imposed past two children. It was just too helpful having an extra source of income provided by three, four , or even five children.\n\nThe advertising display shifted to a picture of the new meat cakes that the government had released Around him, Rey heard stomachs groaning in protest.\n\nShifting back to the adverti#BADWORDS#t for MRPs, the display added the incorrect assurance \"processing time guaranteed to be less than two hours!\"\n\nThe false cheer of the ad made Rey feel sick. Not sick enough to leave though. The burning hunger in his belly reminded him that it had been almost a week since he had eaten last.\n\nAhead, Rey could see people going in the door of the MRP.\n\n\"All citizens display barcodes!\" the command was shouted from beneath the tinted visor of the security standing near the door to the factory.\n\n\"Please! Please I didn't mean to break my zone constraints! I just wanted some food for my baby,\" the sobbed words trickled down into Rey's ears from the head of the line.\n\nLooking up, Rey saw a pretty woman sobbing on the ground in front of the security grunt holding her baby.\n\n\"Improperly registered child and zone constraint violation. You know the law.\"\n\nAlong the line, citizens cast their dull eyes downwards and tried to ignore the two shots that rang out.\n\nTwo steps closer to the front of the line.\n\nA long time ago, Rey knew that this would have bothered him. He'd learned a lot since then; keep your head down, follow the law, and work the assigned job. Those were the rules you lived by.\n\nFinally, Rey stepped through the door into the MRP. A short hallway stretched in front of him that was immediately blocked by a desk with a branded official in front of him.\n\n“Barcode and family number.” the voice was well practiced to the point that it sounded lazy.\n\nRey extended his arm with the imprinted code beneath his skin towards the official. “One sir.”\n\n“Down the hallway and first door on the left.” The hand pointed without the eyes shifting the slightest from the paper in front of them.\n\nThe clinical whiteness of the hallway was beginning to get to Rey. It had been a long time since he’d seen true whiteness. Most of the time, things were a constant grey, such as the government mandated uniforms.\n\nRey stepped through the first door on the left into the office before him. A nearly identical branded official sat behind the slightly larger desk in front of him.\n\n“Barcode and family number.” the voice was well practiced to the point that it sounded lazy.\n\n\nRey shoved his arm forward automatically in the motion that had been demanded of him a million times. “One sir.”\n\nFor the first time that Rey could remember, the eyes of the official looked up and into his own. “I suppose you’re wondering why you’re here. Welcome to the Meat Reprocessing Plant. Due to your compliance with government sanctions on your family size, we have decided to reward you. I’m sure that a loyal citizen such as yourself is aware of the overpopulation issues we have been having. Here, we seek to remedy that.”\n\nThe official got up and opened the door behind him. Rey caught a brief glimpse of what appeared to be a meat factory floor before a box was shoved through and the door shut.\n\nGroaning slightly, the official bent over for the box and then dropped it onto the desk. “Here is your government sanctioned reward of one month’s supply of newly produced meat cakes.”\n\nRey’s eyes widened and his jaw went slack. “Y-y-yes thank you sir!” His trembling hands picked up the box slowly and disbelief was evident in his eyes. “Will that be all sir?” a slight tremor in his voice was all that betrayed his excitement.\n\n“Yes citizen. That will be all.” the words were said slowly with some sadness.\n\nRey walked home in a daze, hardly noticing the crying mothers and fathers on all sides. It was quiet that night in his tenement where family noises normally echoed through the halls.\n\nOverpopulation had been solved.\n\nEdit: I know it doesn't quite follow the prompt but when I started writing, this was just kind of where things ended up!","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398816885","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ch5ivli","link_id":"t3_24b3pj","name":"t1_ch5ivli","parent_id":"t3_24b3pj","retrieved_on":1433581239,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":true,"author":"Xethaios","body":"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Council,\n\nIt has come to my attention that there has been some... *neglect* in the budget management. Money is disappearing, funds not going where they should. Just las week I noticed a productivity drop in the engineering department, a serious lack of output over time. I confronted them about it, and they said simply 'we don't have any funding to do anything'. Now, of course they could have been lying, but I know for a fact that they're terrified of me. Absolutely terrified, as if I was the monster hiding in their closet as a child. I went to check the funds distribution, and sure enough, there was a massive chunk taken out of the engineering department's funds. I check their output over the months, and they had, in fact, been outputting appropriate to their funds, meaning it wasn't due to lackluster performance. I confronted you about it, you councilmen and women, and you shrugged it off like it was nothing but a clerical error and swore to have it fixed.  It was fixed, alright, but not the way it should have. Funds disappeared form the research department as well, seemingly lost. So I confronted you, again, and you again promised to fix the issue. Funds disappear from Marketing, I confront, you promise to fix, yada yada yada. You and I all know that this has been going on for almost two years now. Two years, I think, too long.\n\nNow this could be a simple clerical error, stemming from a bug in the software. This is impossible, because I examined the source code myself and there are no issues with it. None, at least, that could cause missing funds. Let's face it, OpenBudget is a #BADWORDS# piece of software and we all know it. It was coded in 2012 for Windows 7, and it's 2020. We have to make our own damn hardware to run the piece of #BADWORDS# excuse for an application because it's too costly and time-intensive to transfer our records over to newer software.  But I digress. As I said, it could be a bug in the software, but I ruled that out. Maybe the clerk's manipulating funds to increase her pay? After all, she does control the payroll. I'm not sure wose #BADWORDS# idea that was, but she controls it. But it can't be Karen because she's still biking from that run-down apartment she lives in, a 30-minute drive. So I dug deeper.\n\nI checked the pay of all the employees, since god knows she hates our guts and would sooner make voodoo dolls of us than talk to us outside of work. She hates us so much she claims that if she didn't need the job, she'd raise the pay of the employees and lower ours. Now, before you say 'but she won't talk to us outside of work', she was drunk at McFarline's Bar and it was 1AM on a Saturday. I'm not sure she recognized me. Anyways, I check the payroll and she hasn't manipulated anybody's pay, but there is an oddly large amount of money going towards the board's budget. She hates us, why would she *raise* out pay?\n\nI do more digging and see that someone else had accessed the budget files. I try ot trace back the source of the changes, but the changes were made under several layers of encryption and VPNs. I call a friend, who specializes in backtracing these kinds of things, and he agrees. It takes a few months, but he delivers. It had come from the one of the general computers that are available in the library. A clever move, except for one thing: whoever chaged the files did so under the general Board account.\n\nOne of you changed the budget, I wa sure of it. But the only thing I didn't know was where the funds were going after that. After a bit of personal #BADWORDS#flict on my part, I snooped on your files. Not just your work files, but your personal computers, your social media, asked your spouses and children and close friends. They were all terrified of me, naturally, but they answered. It seems some of you have been lining your pockets with the extra funds and spending your ill-gotten gains a bit to liberally. Simmons, congratulations on paying off that third estate. Nice purchase, Johnson, that car will last you your lifetime. Really Fields? A hooker? No wonder your wife was pissed.\n\nI was irate. Pissed off. Annoyed. Angry as all hell, out for blood. But worse of all, I was betrayed. Why would you do this? Here are these honest, hardworking employees god knows we don't pay enough, working their asses off to make ends meet because they love this working for the state, love their coworkers, and love their superiors. Most of them enjoy their jobs, aside from Karen who doesn't enjoy anything unless she's drunk or high. And yet here you are, taking pay from them so you can afford a three million dollar car, or pay off your beach house, or buy a #BADWORDS# hooker. \n\nYou all are a bunch of low-life #BADWORDS#. Knowing this, I did some manipulating myself. But not of the budget, stealing form employees like an #BADWORDS# but a manipulation of people. Some might call it an abuse of power, they're probably right. I feel justified in doing it, and that's all that matters to me. Councilmen and women, I am dissolving this government and implementing my own. Come the end of the day, I will have all the power in this country.\n\nYou will all be jobless, unwanted and perhaps even hated, at first by workers of the state government then by the public, known as the #BADWORDS# who used their position of power to further their own selfish desires at the expense of others, like the media and content controllers of old.\n\nNow, you may say that I am not as innocent as I paint myself to be. I'm not painting myself. Yes, I have cheated, sabotaged, lied, and did other things to get to where I am today, including murder. But never have I stolen from those working under me. I intended to control this country from the start, to turn it from a sicky, pathetic shadow of its former glory to a thriving, planet-wide empire. I intend to usher in an era of peace and prosperity for this planet. In this way I am innocent, for the evil deeds I have done are for the greater good of mankind, while the crimes you have committed benefit none but a select few people.\n\nYou are all #BADWORDS#, and I bid your farwell, once and for all. The day's not quite over yet, you still have about ten minutes. But once I tell the employees what you have done, which I will in about five minutes, you're going to need a head start.

{"archived":true,"author":"TABR1","body":"Caterwauling. That was what woke me.\n\nI groaned as I rose from my slumber. I went to the window and what I saw astounded me.\n\nCats. At least you know... 40 of them? All different too, long black fur, short ginger fur. When you picture cats you imagine very quiet, considerate animals, wary to the extreme.\n\nNot these.\n\nEach cat was no more than a pace from what would have been a rival only a day ago, hours even.\n\n\"Darling\" I said to my wife \"Look at this - you won't believe it!\" I remarked, excitedly.\n\n\"Wha..? I told you to let me sleep you idiot!\" She replied \"Go and feed the cat will you?\" She rolled over and resumed her snoring.\n\nMy gaze returning to the absurd sight outside, I saw a girl - no more than 10, approach the dense amalgamation of cats. She mouth something to one in particular and knelt with her hand out, flicking her fingers.\n\nAt once the nearest 5 or 6 cats launched themselves at her face, a scream tore the air and my wife shot up and clawed at me to see where the noise emanated from. The poor girl was on her knees now, her arms wrapped around her face, no longer screaming. I could see the garments she wore falling apart from tears around her shoulders, more cats pounced on the newly bare flesh, manic frenzy.\n\nI could see blinds being drawn and curtains pulled back from other houses now. Faces of all types looked horrified at every window, hands covering mouths and in some cases - weeping.\n\nLooking at the girl more closely I watched for any signs of life, any at all! Underneath the rabble of cats I saw a portion of a face for an instant. Eyes. Looking at my house... looking at me.\n\nAs she turned she exposed a portion of neck. A particularly bulky dark grey cat latched its jaws around her throat before she was gone from my view.\n\nA scream from a newly opened door a ways behind the girl. The mother. On her knees bawling. \n\nI noticed something odd. The flow of cats frenzied in getting to the girl ceased, and left her there naked, bloodied, and twitching.\n\nWhat came next is not so much of a war on cats, more an extinction-level event of any type of domestic pet in mainland Britain that so much as twitched in an aggressive manner.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1398876588","downs":0,"edited":"1398877051","gilded":0,"id":"ch637k5","link_id":"t3_24bx1a","name":"t1_ch637k5","parent_id":"t3_24bx1a","retrieved_on":1433590952,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

He is sitting across the table, checking to see if he still hates broccoli like he did twenty years ago... and twenty before that. He is smiling at me, taking my hand in his while we walk to the car.\n\nThe procedure is his idea. We are two members of a control group of a thousand. It takes little persuasion on his part - It was all I could ever want to spend eternity with him. He speaks three languages, and tells me how he adores me in all of them. I giggle.\n\nMore than two hundred of us die in the first decade. They take their token of longevity and mistake it for immortality, taking up extreme sports or pissing off the wrong people. We are too wrapped up in each other to notice. We do our annual check-ins and keep fastidious notes, but nothing else changes. We are, after all, newlyweds starting our life together. We have jobs, we have friends, and many evenings and weekends are reserved for each other.  \n\nOur friends stop coming out to drink with us. We have explained the procedure to them, endured their worries and teasing, and now bear their bitterness at the currently-closed trial. They stop calling, and we take up activities, together, to meet more people. \n\nWhen they die, I sob for hours, wondering if I have made a mistake. My husband strokes my hair in reassurance. My depression lasts for a year that I barely recall. I decide to learn a new language.\n\nAt 65, our investments swell our bank accounts. I show my husband how our insurance rates have skyrocketed and we touch our foreheads together and laugh.\n\nWe quit our jobs. We start in Copenhagen, where we took our honeymoon, and go to every European city we ever dreamt of visiting. It takes us three years, eight Eurorail passes, six fights, seventy-one museums, and hundreds of kisses. We share grins every time one of our passports gets a double take.\n\nIt's in Venice that I notice how sweaty his palm can be when we hold hands. I find it curious, but still take to wiping my hand discreetly when he lets go. We split up to wander the city and I'm relieved to be alone - Which is only appropriate, I think, after forty years together.\n\nWe come home. We move. We take up new activities, with less crossover. The fights between us become more numerous, but end quickly. He still writes me little notes that make me smile, but I stop saving them. I learn Polish, German, and French, and can now speak more languages than my husband. He brags about this with pride to our friends, and I smile insincerely.\n\nWhat I think of as our second set of friends die. It barely hurt. I sit at the funerals dry-eyed and wondering if I have acclimated to loss. Next to me, my husband grips my hand and grieves silently, red-eyed and firm clenching his jaw, and I find it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAt 95, still as fit as he had been at 30, he decides to take up sailing. I plead sea-sickness, and instead insist on learning to speak Italian. One of his long trips blows him off course, and we have no contact for days. When he is rescued by the Coast Guard, he rushes home to me and embraces me, repeating how much he had missed me and clutching me to his chest. I parrot the words back, alarmed that I hadn't truly noticed that he had been gone at all. He sleeps that night wrapped around me, and I feel the stickiness of our skin pressed together and am disgusted.\n\nOur third set of friends die. My husband is now the one sobbing, begging me to tell him that someday it will hurt less to let people go. I hold him and am silent, unable to admit that I feel nothing. \n\nOur annual check-ins slow, and then stop. The experiment is declared a rousing success, and 400 of us that remain are wished well and sent on our way, to live for as long as we can. I think the procedure is made available to the public, but affordable to only the very rich. My husband rages at the injustice and I decide to start on learning Chinese next. \n\nBy 120, our fights, infrequent as they were, stop altogether when I realise that I don't feel invested in convincing him of anything. \n\nI find being around new people pointless, so I don't join any new activities. My husband goes alone, and increasingly tries to tell me stories of what I've missed out on. I nod and smile and practise my conjugations in my head. I don't remember what loneliness feels like. \n\nHe gives me worried glances when he thinks I don't see. He offers to learn Fresian with me, a secret, mostly-language shared only between the two of us, he explains with a wink, and I stare at him blankly until I understand why he thinks I might want this - But I do not.\n\nOur hugs are automatic. He sighs in relief every time my arms wrap around him, and I struggle to recall why I once enjoyed this so much. \n\nHe is next to me, doing his daily crossword. He is sitting across the table, checking to see if he still hates broccoli like he did twenty years ago... and twenty before that. He is reaching for my hand, but I am lost in thought and cannot remember what it felt like to want to reach for his.\n\nI have been married to my husband for 138 years.

His talking falcon Pegasus had only returned from a scouting mission at God’s lair a moment earlier, with news that the God Squad was planning a raid on the Time Warner-North Korea compound by nightfall to neutralize the last remaining hydrogen reactor in existence. “You have to get to Jesus immediately” Fisher told Pegasus. “Tell him the chickens have come home to roost. It’s time to implement Operation #BADWORDS# Storm.” Fischer knew they needed at least another week before they were ready to take on the Holy Forces again, but timing had always been mankind’s largest disadvantage. Dodging pros#BADWORDS#utes, dope addicts, and #BADWORDS#abonds, Fischer booked it to the Dome of the Rock to disengage the reactor and prepare it for transport.\n\nBy the time Fischer arrived at the Dome of the Rock, Jesus had already begun to put the decoy device into place. “Thinks he can force us to give in, does he? Well #BADWORDS# that” Jesus cackled. “If he wants to take us out, he’ll have to do better than make the universe collapse in on itself, brothers.” A cry rose from the Jesusite Brigade gathered in the Fifth Temple. Jesus hoisted his AK-47 in the air, pumping his fist with the passion of the Christ. “He layed siege to our fortress and starved us with little regard for our women and our children. For what? Because 3,000 years ago mankind discovered nuclear fusion and lost all need for divine intervention? We will never give up our homes! Not then, not now, not ever!” The crowd started to chant: Je-sus, Je-sus, Je-sus, Je-sus.\n\nFischer approached Jesus after the reactor had been locked onto the bed of the underground railroad and sent toward its destination at the center of the earth’s core. “You think he’ll call the bluff?” Fischer asked. “He can’t,” Jesus responded. “There’s no way you can make demands of a man with a gun to his head.” Just then, Pegasus returned and informed Fischer and Jesus that the Holy Forces’ First Airborne Unicorn division had taken up a position just above the southwest hemisphere, preparing to flank a frontal assault led by the God Squad. Fischer’s phone starts to ring. “That should be Gabriel right about now” Jesus said. “Should I answer it” Fischer asked. “Go ahead. Let’s see what he has to say.”\n\nFischer answered the phone. “I want this to end calmly” Gabriel began. “There’s no reason more of your men should die. You’re outnumbered, outmaneuvered, and you don’t have the supplies left to hold up fortification much longer. Just hand over the reactor and we’ll point our  missiles away from the sun.” Jesus grabbed the phone from Fischer’s hand. “Tell that sonuva#BADWORDS# I’m not giving into his demands this time Gabe! Tell him I know what happened to Joseph! Tell him I know he’s not my real father!” “Listen, Jesus. This is your last chance. God’s not letting up, not this time, not after what happened in Prague.” “We have nowhere else to go” Jesus pro#BADWORDS#d. “He’s sucked the life from every other star in the universe, and now he’s only doing this to spite me. You’re just his #BADWORDS#, Gabe.” “We know where the Time Warner-North Korea compound is weakest, Jesus. We know how to get in, and we’ll be gone before you even realize it.

{"archived":true,"author":"DemBonez665","body":"The heavy cemetery gate hung open. A structure of wrought iron, bars spaced apart so as to allow vision, but never passage, with #BADWORDS#ed tops, almost like spear points, with the tips dulled intentionally. The ornate vinework, with thick creeping vines interwoven between each bar, leaves and clusters of g#BADWORDS#s \"growing from them\", as drab and black as the rest of the gate. The vinework itself made for easy climbing, and the points would only catch errant clothing, not impale intruders, making the gate a mere formality, even when closed. \n\nThe locking mechanism had rusted up, 45 years ago. The then-caretaker didn't realize this until he broke a key in the lock, and shattered the internal mechanism. For a few years, he kept it closed with padlock and chain, until the local high schoolers kept cutting the chain with bolt-cutters. Thus, the gate stopped being locked. Eventually, the caretaker retired, and nobody took over the job. There was a much newer, larger cemetery in a much more accessible location, so a forgotten cemetery faded into the distance, silently keeping its dead, forgotten much like its inhabitants. \n\nOver time, the ground shifted, the twin brick pillars holding the gate in place separated the gates themselves eventually broke the gate apart for good, each gate swinging into place, to where they had rested for the past two decades. Nature had slowly started reclaiming the area for its own, but while moss and actual vines grow freely, stone lasts, and metal endures.\n\nSo it was more than somewhat peculiar when a bipedal figure trudged up to this cemetery, stopping at the entrance to stare at the open gate. A dark brown trench coat with patches here and there, frayed sleeves and threadbare collar, flipped up to protect its wearer against the elements, obscured the body. The bottom portion of the coat fell to below the knees, with a pair of black military boots jutting out from below it, while a grey hornburg hat perched atop the head completed the picture of the mysterious figure. A gloved hand removed itself from an outer pocket to reach within the jacket, procuring a pair of silver boxes. The other hand joins its mate in a ritualistic set of movements-opening one box, extricating a thin, white cylinder and placing one end between the lips, closing the box, then agile fingers switching to the other box, flipping open the top, and turning a wheel to spark, then ignite, the wick whilst the other hand shelters the flame-in turn lighting the end of the tobacco-stick, a finger flick closing the second box and extinguishing the fire with a satisfying metallic clink.\n\nA long inhalation, as a red glow provides sudden light to the dark area. An exhalation, and a cloud of white issues forth from the shadowed, bespectacled figure. It steps forward, entering the sanctum, and violating the silence with crunches on decaying plant life. The pattern continues-inhalation, a suffusion of light on a worn and leathery face, exhalation, light reduction and the acrid white cloud issuing from between cracked lips. \n\nThe figure counts 19 rows through the main aisle, the hooks left, a finger gesticulating to the tombstones once, twice, thrice- the procession stops at the third marble slab, broken along its length, to be shorter than the others. The remaining words, \"is survived by none, and made a widower upon his wedding night. His wife, Elizabeth Lavenza, rests beside him.\" \n\nThe figure taps the end of the tube, dislodging ash upon the ground. Looking at the tube, dramatically shortened from its original length, the figure scoffs, and flicks it a few feet away. A new one is produced, and the same peculiar ritual is repeated, with similar results. Flick, light, clink, glow, exhale, smoke. A dry cough rips through the gloom, filling the void.\n\nThe hat is removed, a hairless head with s#BADWORDS#ches crossing every way is revealed by moonlight, a disfigured face with the left upper lip curled back, teeth yellow, and eyes sharp and cold. \n\n\"So, *Herr Doktor*, we meet at last. Your process has been advanced marvelously since you perished in that frozen waste. I am a subject of it, as you can clearly see. And despite my best attempts, I simply cannot die. So I shall raise you, as I was raised, and you shall help me find the secret to eternal death.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1399415903","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chbc0bp","link_id":"t3_24wah7","name":"t1_chbc0bp","parent_id":"t3_24wah7","retrieved_on":1433681523,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

To create a new world.\n\nI looked around my mess of a room for my iPhone. It was half past seven in the morning. I had received a text from Ayana. She had left for work early for some reason.\n\n&gt;I packed you a lunch.

The company was going to unveil something big. A grand event was planned. And as big as this event is, I still wasn't allowed to celebrate, but instead, I was assigned to improve the big surprise while they show off the prototype. I took my sandwich made with love in my generic lunch box and left my studio apartment.\n\nI waited for the 3 train on 96th that day, wondering what was I going to do after work. Maybe I would take Ayana out on a date. Who knows?\n\nThe train had arrived, a nice and empty 3 train. There was a guy who had caught my attention specifically. He couldn't be any younger than 15. His eyes were a chocolate-brown color behind glasses. He stared at the door across from him, the door I entered in. He was in a black jacket, blue jeans, the normal casual getup. He seemed familiar, but I didn't recall meeting him.

I don't know if it was the sunset on the horizon of Miami Beach or the smell of the new Delorean I had earned. That new car smell... A promise of adventure that needs to be broken in, like a baseball mitt. I drove it down to the parking lot by my office, where I would continue revolutionizing interior design.\n\nI was sure I had done it. I named it \"Minimal Whitewash\". I showed my boss this design and he said it was great. By the next morning, the concept was sent in along with a small model. It was already halfway to the New York office, all we needed to do was wait.\n***\n*5*\n\nI was at the office on 32nd Street and 9th Avenue. The boss had asked me to integrate a computer into a bedroom, along with the capability to integrate with the Oculus VR headset. I assured him I was on it and began my work. After many, many ideas, one popped out as the inspiration for this project: *\"The Future is Now\"*. I had centered my creation around this idea. The future. It was horrific. It was too... Simple... Too present. But then, a lightbulb formed! I rushed down to the ba#BADWORDS#t and looked for an archive box. Anything from the 90s is too fresh, I thought, but the 70s seemed too old. And then I stumbled upon the 80s. The present looks on the 80s as cool, so I thought, why not? I looked through some past designs... Too square... Too colorful... Too retro... But then, I stumbled upon a masterpiece. \"Minimal Whitewash\" was it's name. It's corners were rounded and the room was in a glossy color of white. It was a vision of the future, and soon, it was going to be a part of it.\n\nI made a copy of the concept, making room for an in-wall TV, a bluetooth radio for the Oculus VR, the works.\n\nWithin months, the concept was greenlighted and was soon a reality. Every home in America will have one of these.\n***\n*6*\n\nA commercial blared loudly on the television set:\n\n&gt;Become your ancient ancestors! Become your future offspring!

Every single strand of uploaded DNA.\n\nJay, interested to see how fake this was, clicked on the link, loading a Dropbox download link. He clicked it, downloading Terabytes of data onto his Solid State Drive. He checked the files to see if they were compatible with his room. All of them were .anid files, the files of DNA of the Animus. He had hired some #BADWORDS#rs to test out his newly compiled Animus Hack. The files were distributed via a private Skype group, which was never found by anyone.\n\nThe #BADWORDS#rs loaded up their downloaded Animus Hack into their rooms and headsets.\n\n    run C:\\Program Files\\JayTech\\AnimusTest\\anidhack.exe\n\nThey were all pronounced dead at the discovery of their bodies.\n***\n*8*\n\nI had awakened to the sound of Ayana's voice.\n&gt;Wake up, sweetie.\n\nI had a vision.

{"archived":true,"author":"the_sock_thief","body":"The day I got the nose ring the atmosphere of the whole city was unsettled. Everything was depressed – me, the news, the sky. I wanted to shake it up, to shake it all off, these past weeks of rain. It took me most of the afternoon to walk across Hoboken, no buses or taxis were allowed on the roads, and the recoding played over the loudspeakers told me that even I had to be off of them by seven o’clock.  It was barely two miles straight through the city, but taking the passable streets, marked out with green circles painted on retaining walls and buildings, lead one on a longer, zigzagging path. When I fell, it was inevitable; I took in a generous mouthful of puddle water. Its bouquet was heady and sweat, similar to acetone, but it burned going down, coating my throat with a soapy film. I could only take shallow breathes after that, and bubbles crept up my throat to burst against my eyes with each one.  I arrived, finally, completely filthy. The foundation of the tattoo parlor was ringed in a dry crust of motor oil; the water in this part of town had receded. Or, maybe it would return after low tide. The familiar protocols of the shop didn’t calm the itch that drove me there. If anything, my restlessness grew while I was inside. I harbored hope of relief being dose dependent and asked for a second piercing, dropping a few more bills on the counter. My skin #BADWORDS# out of the piercer’s deft hands to twitch against the bones of my face. We escaped the needle, running down red marked roads, the smell of acetone growing stronger and more pleasant. We were so high, so free for a while. When I became self-aware again, I regretted that I never got the lip ring I paid for. Everything else, this body, I had to accept.

{"archived":true,"author":"AskingTransgender","body":"#BADWORDS#le: just one test.\n\nI scanned the empty houses as I drove, the silver pistol clutched tightly between my knees.  Even here, over ten miles from the unofficial edge of the Sacramento Dead Zone, nobody seemed to be home.  I frowned.  No matter.  The father out I went, the better, really.  Less chance anything would be linked back to me.   It would definitely suck to be the first murder conviction in California in over a decade.\n\nNot that I didn't trust the Angel.  He'd been pretty damn impressive, bursting into my kitchen glowing all holy-like.  And how could he even have known my secret prayer unless he were the real deal? And the gun did *feel* more than earthly.  But… well, I had to make sure.  Just in case.\n\nAnd so here I was.  Just one test; one random, untraceable test, just to prove that what the Angel said about the weapon of the Lord leaving no earthly evidence was true.  Then , if it worked—and of course it would work, he was an angel, I just *had to be sure*—then I'd get on with removing the world's evil.  An agent of vengeance.  No, a herald of divine judgment.  Yes, I liked the sound of that.\n\nBut as I drove, further and further, I still didn't pass a soul.  I had to be at least twenty miles outside the dead zone now, and I could *See* lights and activity off in the distance… just none on my path.  Nor any other readily accessible path, for that matter. My palms began to sweat on the steering wheel.  I passed a school, also empty, but that at least wasn't strange.  That was just another one of the relics left from back in the eighties, when Sacramento had still been a major city, instead of the real-estate graveyard it was today.   Once they'd needed all these buildings.   It was a strange thought.\n\nI sighed.  Still no people around.  This would be so much *easier* if only I'd lived somewhere else.  From what I'd heard, in most cities of this size, one couldn't walk ten feet without bumping into someone else, never mind twenty miles.  Mostly, I liked the quiet, but I was beginning to see what people meant when they called it the hollow city.  Frankly, if I hadn't been born here, I doubt I'd have come either.  It was spooky.\n\nI parked the car.  I was almost out of fuel, and this was getting ridiculous.  Gun in hand, I walked down the sidewalk, eyes peeled for *anyone* that I could test the gun on, fuming.  This was ridiculous.  If the angel had just appeared ten or twenty years ago, I could have been done in five minutes.  Completely unfair.  Why the *hell* didn't anyone live in Sacramento anymore? \n\nMy heart skipped a beat.\n\nWhy the hell *did* no one live in Sacramento anymore?\n\n…\n\nI looked at the gun, as realization dawned.  A traceless weapon.  Just one test.  How does one take just one test of a weapon that leaves no evidence it was ever fired?\n\nOne doesn't.\n\nOne tests it once, then, having no idea the test is complete, tests it again.  And again.  And again, and again, until a city of… god, what was Sacramento's population in the eighties?  Four hundred thousand?  Now we were at, what… twenty thousand?  What if the population hadn't just dropped?  What if I'd #BADWORDS#d the gun, re-written history, again, and again, and again?  Erasing everyone unlucky enough to cross my path, then those unlucky enough to replace those, and… dear god, how many loops had I done?  Just hundreds of thousands?  Or millions?\n\nI knew what I should do.  I knew where I should point the gun.  The angel chose me for a reason.  I was *good,* damn it.  I was good.  I wasn't a murderer.   And maybe, just maybe, it would erase the harm I'd done.\n\nI went home.  I put the heavy metal  to my head… and I put it down.  I put the gun in my dresser, unfired, and went to sleep.\n\nTomorrow.  I'd wait until tomorrow.  Just one day.  What harm could come from just one more day?\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1399637710","downs":0,"edited":"1399638007","gilded":0,"id":"chdk9qo","link_id":"t3_2542zi","name":"t1_chdk9qo","parent_id":"t3_2542zi","retrieved_on":1433720231,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}

He had travelled through the land of Cat and Mouse playing their eternal game, had bested the Two-Headed Demon's games of logic, and braved the darkness of The Deepest Closet to get here.

What are you doing all night anyways?\" His Mother woke him up this way every morning for as long as he could remember. \n\n\"I was just sleeping,\" he mumbled, same as he did every morning. \n\nShe didn't smack him or call him a smart-ass this time. She must need something today. \n\n\"Mr. Johnson is coming by later, and he's bringing Justin with him. Don't be such a nerd this time. Actually make some friends and stop being such a #BADWORDS# loser. You don't want to end up like your Uncle do you?\" \n\nUncle Mark was homeless, married to a pros#BADWORDS#ute, or in the loony bin depending on the day it seemed. His Mother changed that story every time she told it to him. He knew enough by now to know that if he kept reading so much and not socializing that's how you end up \"being a worthless little parasite,\" aka whatever was going on with his Uncle. \n\nJustin was another story. Victor was left wondering which of his toys Justin was going to break that day...Victor wished he could just go back to sleep. He had finally gotten to Ellenmoore! Ever since the gnomes of the Vale had told him of the Prophecy he had been trying to reach it. Sleeping as much as he could to keep advancing. \n\n\"-ause you know that people have to actually like you for you to get a job right? Reading the dictionary again is just going to get you what you deser-\" \n\nHis mother was still going. If he was lucky she'd finish in time for him to get breakfast before the daily bullying started. He didn't know why his mother invited Mr. Johnson over so much but it assumed it had something to do with sex. He read about that in the encyclopedia! When he brought it up at school he just got in trouble though. Adults don't like it when you know more than they think you should. They sent him to a psychologist, but Mom had told him how to lie to them. Don't want to end up in the loony bin, all the stories about that were scary. Kept him from sleeping...from finishing his task. \n\n-That Night-\n\nVictor opened his eyes to see a wave of red grains bending and blowing in the wind like fire. \"That's right! I've finally made it! Now just to get to the tower,\" he thought to himself. \n\nThe gnomes had told him of the beauty of Ellenmoore and the tragedy that had befallen it. The Prophecy stated that once the rightful King had come forward and proven himself he could sit forever upon a throne of silver. A throne of wit and wisdom as opposed to a golden throne of power. A throne he felt would be just right for him. He began his descent onto the plains. \n\nThe first clue he had extracted from the cat. Getting it to pay attention to him instead of the chase had been hard enough, he had had to catch a large enough fish and even then spent the better part of a week dreaming to get it done. \n\n\"Following the obvious path will only cause pain, a shadow will cripple and brick will drain. Instead watch the wind, wherever it may roam. What it will show you will be your new home,\" and Victor had just figured it out after setting his first sight on the tower. The tower was large and imposing, right in the middle of the path through the grain field. As he approached it he was cautious and noticed something out of the corner of his eye. There was no grain where the shadow fell. \n\n\"This must be a trap! The second part said watch the wind...what could that mean? The stalks blowing in the wind! Haha!\" He had always been good at puzzles, more so in the dream realm where they almost seemed tailored to him. It was actually as if he was the prophesied king! He sprinted with excitement back up the hill to watch the wind. \n\nThe wind was blowing through the reeds but appe-\n\n\"Victor wake your ass up or you're going to be late for the bus! I'm not driving you, I'll make you walk this time and I mean it!\" \n\nWalking to school would probably actually be more dangerous than sticking around here. It wasn't exactly the best area. \"When I'm older, when I'm in High School I'm going to get strong enough to go anywhere I want. I'll get a bike and ride it all over this city and nobody will bother me. Nobody to steal my back pack, or try to take me away, or take my shoes and throw them on the wires anymore,\" he promised himself. It was the best he could do. For now, he'd actually have to get moving. \n\nShowers were the most terrifying thing in the world. He couldn't hear his mother come in, see her walk up, and if she hit him and he fell he was afraid he wouldn't be able to get back up. If he was dead he couldn't sleep, he couldn't get his throne. He had to see the end of that dream. No matter what it took or what he had to put up with in real life to allow him to keep sleeping. He needed to solve the puzzle, wake the people of Ellenmoore, become their king. It was all he had left. \n\nHe showered as quickly as he could and got dressed and presentable before walking out to the kitchen. \n\n\"Is that seriously what you're wearing?! Seriously?! Do you want to #BADWORDS#ign embarass me? Everyone is always judging me because my stupid son acts like a nerd and dresses like a dork. Get over here!' she grabbed his arm and dragged him violently into the room, throwing him into the dresser. \"Pick out some clothes and make them actually #BADWORDS# match this time you useless piece of #BADWORDS#.\" \n\nHe pulled out different clothes and tried again. \n\n\"Get out of here and get on the bus, it's going to be here in 5 minutes. You better run, if you could just do things right the first time you wouldn't have this #BADWORDS# problem.\" \n\nVictor ran out to the bus, barely catching it on the corner before it left. That meant that he was the last one on and wouldn't be able to take a seat by himself. He hoped whoever he had to sit with wouldn't mind. \n\nToday was lucky, the kid didn't shove him out of the seat or call him names. It was best when they left him alone, at least till recess. Recess there was no avoiding it. \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1399704426","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cheaoj6","link_id":"t3_254cpi","name":"t1_cheaoj6","parent_id":"t3_254cpi","retrieved_on":1433732875,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"AllyBeth","body":"The planet was already emerging from the distance before I truly started to realize what was happening... what we were doing...\n\nIf you think about it, it wasn't really our fault. They were destroying the planet with their garbage, filling the atmosphere with chemicals... when it came to the planet itself, we were doing a favor. \n\nI thought about asking the leaders if the planet could be shared, but the reality was that I already knew the answer to that question. We were healthier than them; lived longer. We needed it more. My home planet was lovely but the fact was that there just wasn't enough room for us all, and if we emptied this planet, started over, we could prevail. All of our research showed that these beings would not be able to survive the release of carbon monoxide that we would soon be pouring into the atmosphere. The humans... animals... everything would be gone, but the effect would not harm us in the slightest. I found myself pondering whether or not it would hurt, and I thought back to my own family. If anyone would destroy us, all I would ask is that it wouldn't hurt. I thought of my sons and daughters gasping for breath, crying and trying as hard as they could to scream while they slowly suffocated; I thought about how if it happened, there would be nothing that I could do about it, and that was what brought me to the leaders.\n\n\"There has to be another way.\" I stated. I didn't yell, for I knew that they wouldn't take me seriously if I did. I wanted to show them that it wasn't just my emotions getting the better of me, what we were about to do was wrong. \"There are children on this planet! Babies!\"\n\nPart of me had expected the leaders to laugh at me, but there eyes held sympathy. \n\n\"A child is only a small adult.\" One of them said, putting his hand on my shoulder. \"I know it's hard, soldier, but it's for the best. These beings are destroying this planet. If we leave them in charge, I wouldn't expect life to even exist in the next million years.\"\n\n\"We could teach them.\" I stated, knowing how silly it sounded. If we made ourselves known we would cause I riot. This was common knowledge. \n\n\"We'll be putting them to sleep first.\" The leader said, no longer making eye contact with me. \"It won't hurt. They won't even know it happened. Think of it as going to bed and never waking up.\"\n\nI had to admit that made me feel better. I was aboard this mission to support my family. There lives could be better, but only if I completed what I said I would do. As the planet approached in the distance, I noticed the devise that would end the lives of Earths current beings. It looked like a button, only you turned it before pressing it in, ensuring that it wouldn't be accidentally released too early. A message would be broadcast to everyone on the ship before the extermination began and we would all take our positions. The leader I had been speaking to noticed me staring. \n\n\"You should get back to your post.\" He said. The sentence caught me off guard, bringing me back to reality. Again I reminded myself who I was doing this for, and with a large sigh, I turned my back to the leaders, mumbled a 'Yes sir', and returned to my post, ready to begin a new life.\n\n\n\nThis could be better if I spent a few days editing, but this is what you get in one draft ;)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1399766588","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chessy4","link_id":"t3_258khi","name":"t1_chessy4","parent_id":"t3_258khi","retrieved_on":1433741545,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"toraksmash","body":"Gregory loved being a star, but things had been really hard for him ever since Ophelia went supernova.  \n\nShe had always been radiant. Ophelia could outshine anyone. Anyone but Gregory. Every eye in every room was on her, but only until he worked his magic on that guitar.   \n\nThe ride to the top had been bumpy. There were cold calls from \"agents\" with sticky plastic couches, more legitimate calls from agents with sticky flesh fingers. Jimmy Johnson was one of the latter. He had a nose for talent, he'd say. He said this while sniffling, his nose twitching at the table. Hindsight being what it was, Gregory knew it wasn't talent that gave Jimmy that energy and enthusiasm, and it wasn't talent his nostrils had been craving that day.   Ophelia bought Jimmy's spiel about being the Voice Of A Generation. Hindsight being what it was, Gregory knew Jimmy was right.   \n\nThe duo topped charts and played packed arenas of adoring fans. Gregory wrote hit after hit. \"We can't begin to understand how he manages to pump out one mindblowing single after another,\" Rolling Stone declared. \"We just need to sit back and enjoy the ride.\" \n\nThat's exactly what Ophelia was doing. She was the Voice, which expanded to being the Face (before it was reduced to the Body). Jimmy took her to industry meet and greets while Gregory was working his magic.  O, as Jimmy branded her, was meeting all the 'right people' and being seen in the 'right places' and doing the 'right drugs'.   \n\nIt was great for a while. Gregory got to be the brilliant mind and musician. O got to shine.   \n\nO had never been one for half measures, so she shined with all her might. She shined through blackouts and depression. She shined through weed. She shined through coke. She shined through oxys. She shined through Jimmy's drug fueled abuse.   \n\nIt had been a great show. The seats were packed and the crowd was electric and the music was good and Ophelia was positively glowing. The spotlights had hugged her glittery dress just so, caught the rhinestones in her hair at such an angle, that for an instant she was burning. Her arms were spread as she belted the chorus and light burst from her just as her voice did.  It was a good note for her to go out on.   \n\nGregory and O retreated backstage before the encore. Her retreat was more urgent than his, because O had someone waiting for her. As Gregory nursed a beer in his dressing room, O and her heroin dealer were being interrupted by Jimmy in the middle of their transaction. Jimmy had little trouble with a needle in O's arm, but mucho trouble with some junkie's needle in O's mouth.   \n\nThe crowd didn't hear the gunshots over their own roar, but Gregory did.   \n\nGregory still wrote. Gregory still played. There were S's and A's and J's aplenty, all eager to be the Voice Of A Generation. Gregory loved being a star.   \n\n\n\n--From my phone when I should be asleep.

Did you see? I totally smashed into that other car! It was awesome!”\n\n“Yeah! I was watching. Nice moves!”\n\nEric leapt up into his arms, giving him a great big hug. He quickly dropped out and was off, running towards the giant multi-coloured slide. Dave scooped up his backpack and followed Eric quickly, his limbs protesting as he jogged along. Eric skidded to a stop and turned back, grinning ear to ear.\n\n“Come on Dad! Keep up!”\n\n“Coming Eric!” Dave accelerated ---\n\n*“Who’s Eric?”*\n\n*“His son. Died in a car crash and he hasn't been the same since. His ex-wife doesn't even bother visiting any more, he doesn't recognize her anyway.”*\n\n*“Poor bas#BADWORDS#.

Behind him A single, lonely green balloon bounced fitfully on its tether, trying to escape.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1399923666","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chg6yna","link_id":"t3_25d8x1","name":"t1_chg6yna","parent_id":"t1_chg5j9t","retrieved_on":1433765657,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

Time is all but irrelevant to me, and you are certainly not getting any younger.\"\n\nThese were the first words that the being known as the Devil said to me.\n\n\"Sure,\" I replied \"but can I pee first?\"\n\nI awkwardly stepped past him into the stall and I'm sure he heard my stream hit the water from the other side of the flimsy yet stylish wall. *Was that rude?* I thought. *Should I be more respectful? Maybe he wants me to be rude; the dark side of human nature and all that.*\n\nWhen I stepped back out and less-than-elegantly again skirted past him, I moved to wash my hands. Shortly after the automatic faucet activated, he began to speak. \n\n\"World peace, as you and your peers out their call it, will be the downfall of the human race. I'm here to help you help me throw the world back into its usual state of conflict.\"\n\nThat statement alone gave me a lot to say, but I figured it was best to let him talk. I went to dry my hands.\n\n\"I will not try to sweet talk you. To be honest I don't actually know what you are thinking, but it can only be one of a few things. Either you think I'm the Devil and I'm lying because *of course* I don't want world peace or you are confused because I'm telling the truth and you cannot figure out why I would actually want to *save* humanity.\"\n\n\"What's option three?\" I asked.\n\n\"What makes you think there is an option three?\" He replied.\n\n\"Well, you said there's only a few things I could be thinking, but you listed two. If you meant two, you would have said a couple. What could I be thinking that made you say 'a few' instead of 'two'?\"\n\nHe smiled as he gave me his answer.\n\n\"I knew you were the right choice. Option three is, you already know that you are going to say yes to my offer. I do not care whether it is because you think I am right or because you like watching people suffer as much as I do, but you are going to say yes and do your part to un-do what you have already done.\"\n\nI didn't bother replying that time. He was right and he knew he was right.\n\n\"You see, you cannot be sent to heaven *or* hell for something your parents did. That means while you and everyone at this party can pat themselves on the back and shake hands with the big man when they die, your kids and their kids are...\"\n\nFor a being who defied God, he hadn't frightened me until that moment. His silence meant something I couldn't comprehend; something no one I knew could comprehend. What fate could my children be in danger of living out that could bring the Devil himself to silence?\n\n\"Suffice to say,\" He continued. \"they are #BADWORDS#. Every generation after yours is going to deserve to go to heaven because you achieved world peace, but they will not get in. This system you created, it is unstoppable after today. It is going to make sure everyone behaves perfectly and happily. They will have just the right amount of joy and pain, but they will never sin. They will not be responsible for their actions either and so they just plain won't be judged. I cannot tell you what that means because you would not understand, but I *can* tell you that tonight is your last chance to change that. Before they flip that switch and everything goes live eight AM tomorrow, you will make the biggest decision humanity has ever made, and maybe its last.

It’s just dinner… with our dads; what could possibly go wrong?”\n\nI fixed my glasses on my face, staring deep into my reflection in the bathroom mirror. My hair was disheveled; my suit was a size too big... and even my best tie had this weird stain on it. “What am I even doing here?” I asked myself with a sigh. “You don’t deserve her. We’re nothing alike. She’s adventurous and outgoing; you’re… not. She genuinely cares about others; you try to avoid eye-contact with Salvation Army bell ringers around the holidays.” *Her dad is Commander Avalanche and yours is Crazy Brain.* ”She’s extraordinary in every way and you’re just…plain.” I splashed some water in my face in any attempt to get some confidence.\n\n“Towel, sir?” The bathroom attendant asked, shoving his hand in my face in an obvious attempt to get me to leave a tip. I stared at him for a second, attempting to formulate a proper response.\n\nI ended up using my suit coat to dry my face out in the hall.\n\nThere she was, Elizabeth. She the most beautiful woman I had ever met, sitting in an awkward silence next to her father. She was rubbing her temples, like she always does when she’s annoyed. Seeing me, stopped, shining a smile bright enough to warm even the coldest of hearts. I still remember regaining consciousness to that smile after one of my Dad’s last world-domination schemes. Thanks to him, I had to find a new job.\n\nSpeaking of Dad, where the hell was he?\n\nIt was awkward sitting at the table with my date and her father. For one, this was the first time she had introduced me to the Man made of Ice. Secondly, I was the only one not in a costume. Being normal is just **great**.\n\n “H-hello Sir, it’s ice to meet you.” I said, reaching out my hand for an introduction. My foot was in my mouth almost as soon as the words escaped my lips. With a cold glare from the man, I was quickly reminded of that it wasn’t cool to make ice puns, intentionally or not. I tried to save it. “I-I’m Bryce. I’ve heard a lot about you.” The hero raised a curious eyebrow. *I should not have said that.* Elizabeth quickly pulled me down into my seat before I could say anything else.\n\nAn awkward moment of silence passed before the waiter showed up. “How is everyone doing today? Our soups of the day are Lobster Bisqu-“ The sound of an explosion quickly drowned out the names of expensive soups. I was thrown to the floor, ears ringing. The other customers were panicking as the smoke began to clear, revealing that my Dad had finally arrived for dinner. Elizabeth’s Dad was shouting something, pointing at me. Elizabeth just rubbed her temples. My dad looked like he was doing his patented evil cackle.

{"archived":true,"author":"Kiloku","body":"\"Damn it, damn it! He's serious!\" She had just finished walking all around the island, realizing she was stuck.\n\n\"Alright, Artemis, relax, you're the goddess of hunting, surviving is what you do. But... Stuck?!\"\n\nShe took an arrow from her infinite quiver and shot to the horizon. It shattered into golden sparks about half a kilometer away from the shore.\n\n\"damn, sky man, I said I wasn't going to tell anyone about your affair. It's not like it's your first one!\"  \nShe avoided mentioning Zeus by name, but he was the one who imprisoned her, simply because she witnessed him having sex with a Meadow Nymph. Artemis couldn't care less, being a chaste goddess never meant she gave a damn if others were chaste.\n\nSurviving was not a problem, but she couldn't just sit down and accept her fate on that small island. Being limited to never seeing the many different wildernesses of the world was *not* an option. She had to escape, but for now, she had to work with what she had.  \nOn the second day of imprisonment, she had already set up an impeccable camp and was out hunting.\n\nShe was perfectly silent amidst the trees and her bow had an arrow nocked, ready to shoot at a moment's notice.  \nThen, something moved. In a split second, an arrow had hit it with a metallic clang.  \n\"Hey! Settle down!\" screamed a familiar voice, whose owner held a shield pierced by the golden arrow.   \n\"Hermes? Don't sneak up on me like that while I'm hunting!\"  \n\"I'm sorry, sis, but I'm here in secret. Zeus wants to get rid of you. He promised a nymph that she could be the goddess of the wilderness.\" \n\nShock appeared on her face instantly, her voice trembled with outrage:\n  \n\"What?! I'm his daughter, how can he let some one night stand take precedence?! And when you say 'get rid of me', you mean... \"  \n\"Yes, he wants to mortalize you. I don't think I've ever seen dad so lovestruck. If you could call that love. I think Eros and Cupid thought it'd be funny and now their joke is out of control. \"  \n\"Do you think I can escape?\"   \n\"I guess so. Everything is possible, Arti.\"  \n\"Well, how did you enter?\"   \n\"You're the only one who can't leave or enter. The barrier is personalized for you and your artifacts.\"   \n\"I have an idea then... Brother, I am aware that you don't want dad to know you were here, but you're the messenger god. Tell him that I want to fight that nymph for my rightful spot.\"   \n\"He'll never allow that! You're way more powerful than she is!\"  \n\"Tell him he can give her his blessing and weapons.\", she said, grinning.  \n\"Well... If I have to...\" he was nervous about that idea, but there was no stopping his stubborn sister. And she had a point that he was the messenger. He flew away, bidding Artemis farewell.\n\nTwo days later, just as she was bringing a boar to her camp, she spotted Hermes flying back.  \n\"She'll be here by the sunset. She's wearing an armor made by Hephaestus, on dad's order! And she has his blessing, too. Your arrows can't hurt her!\"  \n\"Don't worry, Herm. I'll take care of that. Now, go back home, who knows what could happen here.\" She hugged her worried brother, who left the island with a heavy heart.\n\nAt the decided time, she was ready. Light armor, bow, arrows, and a net. Her opponent appeared on the horizon, a green-skinned woman, carrying a long spear and wearing a beautiful full suit of Olympian Bronze armor, styled with fig leaves, coming in on a raft.  \n\"My name is Syke! I am the Nymph of the Meadows daughter of Oxylus, as well as the lover of Zeus! Soon to be Goddess of the Wilderness!\" she announced, hoping to sound powerful.  \n\"You are but a child. I think I might even be your great-aunt.\" retorted Artemis, with contempt.  \n\"Don't write me off yet, old woman. I have some tricks up my sleeve.\"  \n\nAs per her sense of honor, Artemis waited until her opponent was on dry land. Syke was the first to strike, lunging at Artemis with a glowing spear. The huntress' reflexes were too fast, and she hit nothing but air. Light on her feet, Artemis took distance and nocked an arrow, which flew true and struck the target. But Hephaestus' work was too much even for Artemis' arrows. The projectile disintegrated from tip to fletching, and Syke was unharmed. \n\nThe nymph changed tactics, calling upon her natural powers to command the vines all over the island to hinder the goddess' speed. Artemis could escape easily from each, but it took her attention away from the opponent, and slowed her down slightly. Every minute disadvantage could mean the difference between life and death. Syke used the opportunity to kick Artemis on the chest, making her fall on her back. The vines receded on her command, she wanted to see the goddess' face as she died. The nymph prepared her spear, pointed at her enemy's face. Just as she striked, her attack was stopped. Again, Artemis' reflexes won, and she held the spear by the tip with both hands.  \nTaking the Nymph's moment of shock as an opportunity, the huntress pushed the spear back, causing the pole to hit Syke's face. White sap dribbled from her nose, and she was stunned. Artemis decided to end the combat, throwing the net over her. \n\nOnly the greatest heroes and gods can escape from Artemis' indestructible net, and now with Syke stuck, Artemis carried her like a just killed boar. She used her power to hover above the water, calmly approaching the barrier. As Syke screamed, she threw the nymph onto the barrier. The net, being an indestructible artifact of Artemis, started burning hotter and hotter, but never falling apart. The nymph died soon, and Artemis carefully took her body away. She donned the armor Hephaestus had built for her opponent, covering herself completely. Now protected from the barrier, as she wouldn't touch it, nor would one of her artifacts, she could leave. She'd have to leave behind her own armor, clothing and weapons, but she could confront \"dad\" now. And besides, he'd ask Hephaestus to make another. He loves to have new projects to work with.\n\n\n\nEDIT: rewrote a paragraph that was too \"matter-of-fact\"-y\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400095523","downs":0,"edited":"1400096906","gilded":0,"id":"chhz8ve","link_id":"t3_25jkg1","name":"t1_chhz8ve","parent_id":"t3_25jkg1","retrieved_on":1433796431,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

{"archived":true,"author":"SnowyMahogany","body":"^(*This is my first try here, so I would love some feedback!*)\n\nI promised to make it back, and I promised to keep our country safe. It's a shame I can't keep both. \n\nMy platoon has already been decimated. Our formation is in tatters, and our brave queen has already fallen. I can still see the trail of death she left in her wake before leaving us. It was a good death. A warrior's death. I'll be lucky to get the same.\n\nThere's only two of us grunts left now. The kid's still out on the frontlines, protecting her knight. I catch just the briefest glimpse of her wide grin before it disappears back into the tumultuous battlefield. It's the kid's first run out here, and she can't see how bad things have gotten. \n\nFrom beside our oh-so-brave king, I see it all falling apart. Our defenses are crippled. He's already thrown away the lives of our bishops, lost to a far-too-risky gambit before the battle had even begun. Only our sturdy rooks stand beside us, protecting us in the inner circle. They beat back assault after assault, but I can see their weariness. \n\nThis king doesn't see the consequences of his actions, and yet I would die for him, without a moment's hesitation. The royal man-child cowering behind me is blind to the blood on his hands. Or maybe he cares only for his own survival. \n\nI should leave him to die. \n\nAnd if his death did not signal the end of our kingdom's independence and the end of the steady peace his father had built up, I would. But for that alone, I keep him alive. \n\nI see a sudden flash of white, and one of our immense rooks topples over. A gleaming white knight stands atop his body, triumphant in his dismantling of our defenses. I ready my blade, but more than that, I ready my very soul for the coming death. This giant of a man dwarfs me and moves faster than I can even understand. Yet I must still stand between him and the sovereign monarch of our nation. He turns his helmed gaze toward me and begins his assault.\n\nI barely parry his #BADWORDS#s. Rapid and endless, it is as if he strikes with a hundred blades at once. Slowly, I am forced to give up ground as he nears the throne. But suddenly, he lunges forward, lance #BADWORDS#, sensing a gap in my defense. A near-flash, he passes right by me, and rushes straight toward the king. \n\nIn that flash, I see my family. I see their deaths. My failure here will kill everyone I've known. And in that flash, I stand again between the knight and our king, faster than I knew I could move. His lance rushes at me, impaling me instead of the king. I'm rewarded by the sounds of our noble king's royal slippers running away.\n\nThe pain nearly cripples me, but with a final rush of strength, I swing my readied blade and sever his lance arm off at the shoulder. He cries out in surprise and pain, falling to his knees. My vision swims with the effort, and the flow of blood from my torso is stemmed only by his lance, but I manage to raise my blade again, ready to sever the man's head from his neck.\n\nAnd in that moment, my body betrays me. My blade slips from my hand as my weak pawn body spasms and falls to the ground. Sensing his chance, the knight rises, bellowing in pain and anger. His only arm draws a hidden knife, and I see in it my own death. A warrior's death at last.\n\nInstead, he turns his back to me. He turns back to the king. I am to be left here, to bleed out. Not even deserving of a proper death. If I was born a knight or a rook, I could save everyone. But instead, I lay here, in a growing pool of blood, a failure to be dishonored.\n\nI feebly try to throw my blade at him, but even in that, my body betrays me as I struggle to even lift my arm. I'm forced to watch as the knight catches the king and raises him into the air, ready to slit his throat.\n\nMy vision is fading, and I can see death's release coming, but still I cling to life. I finally see the black wings of death fly above me.\n\nInstead, they fly past me and rush into the white knight's back. Without a sound, he falls, dead on the ground with an obsidian blade between his shoulders. \n\nIn his place stands a ghost of my queen, resplendent in her deadly grace. Does death grant me a fleeting vision of what could have been, of how this battle might have turned out?\n\nShe turns to me and raises her helm as arms grab me. A more familiar face greets me instead of the queen I expected. The last of my fellow pawns, elevated by a miracle to a queen. There are tears in her eyes. My vision fades out, her glowing visage forever fixed in my mind, and I finally, and simply, let go.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400118570","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chia7f3","link_id":"t3_25kzq0","name":"t1_chia7f3","parent_id":"t3_25kzq0","retrieved_on":1433801719,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

It truly was a pleasing sight. \n\nI calmly took the elevator in order to drop a few levels: a show is best admired from the front row, after all. Some people were busy praying, others cursing.

{"archived":true,"author":"chaos_flare","body":"Shoveling. Shoveling. Always with the #BADWORDS# shoveling. I wipe a trickle of sweat away from my brow and survey the shallow hole I’ve dug. The tombstone is still unreadable in the near dawn, but I already know the initials and the date carved clumsily into its face.\n\nJ. S.   01/08/2070\n\nThe rough handle of my makeshift shovel is giving me slivers as I shove the dull metal end into the dirt and I can feel one of them slide into the ridges of my palm. The familiar sound of metal on metal is like God’s music to my ears. Freedom.  The rickety handle snaps in half as I bring up a load of dirt. \n\n“#BADWORDS# you!” I yell at the offending object, throwing down the pieces of wood and dropping to my knees.  Digging, digging. Always digging. \n\nMy fingers crawl along the familiar flat surface and I find the edges, scraping the dirt away until I find a handle. I haul with all my might, and it slides out of the dry earth easily, knocking me backward onto my ass. It’s lighter than I remember.\n\nEagerly, I clear dirt from the heavy lock sealing my prize shut and take the key from my pocket. The sky is gaining a light hue. I’m running out of time. I look at my haggard watch. \n\n4:36 01/08/2080\n\nI shove the key into the lock and twist. I savor the sweet click of liberty as the lock pops open. This will be the last time.\n\nI pry open the lid. The smell of stale air and metal greets me like an old friend and I quickly grab the plastic wrapped papers that lay on the very top, shoving them into the duffle back they lay atop. They also bear a name, and a picture.\n\nJohnny Smithson.\n\nI hear the sound of snapping in the distance. I peer over the edge of the hole. The jagged rocks to my right are barren, but the dead trees to my left are su#BADWORDS#ious. I grab the revolver and fill the cylinder, locking it back into place, and setting it on my knee.\n\nI hurriedly stuff the rest of the contents into the bag, clothes, two more guns, canteens and some food. Survival of the fittest baby.\n\nMotion to my right makes me jolt and a grab my gun, pointing it towards the movement. Shadows of tree branches.\n\nI tensely lower my arm and take another look around. Still clear. I look down at the bottom of the metal trunk, and trace the name at the end of the inscription.\n\nGood luck my love. This is the last one. If all goes to plan, I’ll see you in paradise. Love Missy.\n\n“You can give us those papers now, Johnny boy.” A voice floated from behind me, making sure to say my name with an extra drawl. \n\nThere was a pressure at the back of my head. \n\n“Now drop the gun and put your hands up.”\n\nFor a moment her smiling face floated through my thoughts, making my heart ache and spirit seethe. Then I saw her broken, bloody body, and I was soothed. Peace flowed through me.\n\nI put my finger on the trigger.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400193418","downs":0,"edited":"1400195459","gilded":0,"id":"chj0sd8","link_id":"t3_25mxgk","name":"t1_chj0sd8","parent_id":"t3_25mxgk","retrieved_on":1433814445,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"PicometerPeter","body":"We were not always members of the Human Collective, it wasn’t until 200 AC (After Contact) that we even became aware of their influence.  For two hundred years they shaped our politics, culture, our whole damn society, and without letting on who they were.  Every bribe, every idea planted in our computer systems, and every covert assassination was anonymous with nothing to indicate an alien presence.  \n\nBy the time they came out of the shadows and officially sent emissaries we were practically them in every way but biology.  Over the next hundred years they showered us with gifts, medicines and technology.  The HC’s medical aid was what ended the Great Plague.  While the virus killed only 0.05% of our billions, the world’s governments used it as an excuse to give more power to the global administrations and their human backed experts.  Over the 25 year period following the Great Plague they eliminated poverty and raised the standard of living ten-fold as well as consolidating power and modernizing the military under the guise of becoming independent of the HC’s protection.\n\nBy 300 AC we had a politically united planet and close economic ties with the HC.  When the Human Collective fell back into war with an old offshoot of humanity, the Compe#BADWORDS#ve Consumption Cult (CCC) of course we lent the full weight of our society to the HC.  It was of course necessary, as the war dragged on, to coordinate our government’s efforts.  We were so close in culture and trade it was only natural for our governments and armies to follow suit in unification, especially with an external threat.  When the war ended in victory it was 20 years before we stopped basking in the glory of our membership in the HC and discovered that we had been carefully brought into the fold by trickery.  The technical gifts and political guidance were carrots, the plague and war sticks…  \n\nAnd we were better for it, for all their treachery and sly tactics the average person is far better off now than they would have been under any planetary government during the autonomy ages.  We mark our calendars now by the date that the first Von-Newman probe spotted our planet, the date our guardian angels took notice of us.  Whatever we were before, we are now humans, and proud of it.  \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400210551","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chj84o0","link_id":"t3_25nr32","name":"t1_chj84o0","parent_id":"t3_25nr32","retrieved_on":1433817976,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":true,"author":"ShellKicker","body":"At first the humans were welcome. The scariest part about them were their space suits they wore before they knew they could breathe our air. Their features were soft unlike our own rough scales. Our young like to play with their long, flowing hair.\n\nThey taught us their language easily. They translated much of our own language from the transmissions they have received over the radio waves for centuries. How clever they were to decipher our words as wall as they did. When the humans landed they had our word for 'love' lit up across their spaceship's shields. \n\nOf course they were met with every military vehicle Querth had on it. We were in contact with the humans a few decades before their arrival. We were well prepared for anything. Although the humans only sent words of kindness, we were apprehensive to their intentions. Their underlying purpose for seeking out Querth did not keep us at ease. They told us Earth was no longer habitable due to the wars their leaders waged. If they cared so little about their own home what would they do to ours?\n\nLuckily, the only weapons they possessed were swords. Swords. Every single one of them had a sword. Men, Women, child. They claimed the power of guns and bombs would only make it easier  for them to revert back to violence.\n\nThe humans were peaceful. They learned their lesson. They yearned for their home. Oceans, mountains, grass, forest but Querth was beautiful and wild to them. Stories of Earth were passed down through the generations and Querth gave life to the words. \n\nThere was also a taboo word they seldom dared to speak. 'Bible' the word of god. The easiest way to explain this bible is it was a way to keep them good. Do good in life, live well in the afterlife. A sweet principle that turned their world sour. So many rights, so many wrongs, and the humans fought relentlessly to prove which right was the best right.\n\nMy Querth's people loved this idea. Some began to write their own 'bibles.' Guidelines to live fully and righteously. It was fun at first but soon escalated into debates. The humans stayed out of it for the most part. A few would join in the fun. Most of them just warned us to stay humble. We heeded this advice in the beginning because it was peaceful and unifying.\n\nThis was short lived as the debates turned to fights and we began to strongly differ on views. \n\n\"Live the way each individual feels is best.\" The humans would plea.\n\nThe people of Querth are prideful and strong. Soon certain types of views were no longer ignored or friendly debated. It was as though silent thoughts were no longer kept to ones self. \n\n'You can't do that because it's wrong,' became the new norm instead of the typical,'be who you are.'\n\nQuerth's people would have meetings to discuss their lives and share their thoughts. These groups had a strong love with-in but got heated against each other.\n\nThen the violence started. We remember it as the, Execution of Matties. Matties was a young Querth girl that befriended a human girl. Through the years they grew together and learned to share a deep love for one another. To many of the population, humans and Querths weren't lovers. One particular Querth group taught to love Querths more than the humans to keep Querth pure. Matties in protest of this group kissed her human friend. Querth and humans alike held a shocked breath. The reaction of the crowd reminded me of a human quote that went something like, 'some people cheered, some people cried, most were silent.'\n\nThe leader of the Querth group made his way to the pair, held Matties face in his hands, and began to cry. Most the humans in the crowd started to smile, a few Querths did too. It was like breaking a block of ice with a hammer. Many people wanted this. Unfortunately more people dreaded interspecies love. The Querth group leader agreed with most people. The smiles in the crowd changed to panic and protest as he began to squeeze Matties face. He closed his hands tighter and tighter even as people tried to pull him off. Blood started running down her face, her eye began to bulge, she kicked at him furiously, until his strong Querth hands closed while still claps onto her face. Matties was his daughter.  \n\nOver 1,000 Querth and humans lost their lives that first day. Ten years later over a hundred million lives have been taken over to the afterlife.\n\nThe humans misplaced their trust in us by telling Querth about their bible. We couldn't stay humble enough.  It took Querth over, and it may never recover.

{"archived":true,"author":"Thrysh","body":"We were in a room that was black as pitch, absent of all sound and feeling, and quite alone. A voice sliced through the silence without echo, reminiscent of nails on glass, \"Why have you come here?\"\n\nI could feel sweat beading down my forehead, ice cold in its trail. Bile was rising in my throat. \n\n\"I've come to make a deal.\"\n\n\"You know my currency, Man. I deal in souls,\" came the haunting reply from the blackness. \n\nThe void was thickening. Wrapping my body in its suffocating cloak. Through the black I could see two smoldering eyes permeating the thickness surrounding. The red engulfed my vision and pain wracked my body. My back arched as I screamed out in pain. Though I could feel the muscles in my mouth opening my jaws, no sound came forth. My wrists and ankles were suddenly bound to air around me. I was paralyzed and in blackness once more. The absence of sensation was tortuous. \n\n\"Yes,\" I gasped. \"I know the price. I've been waiting a millennia to pay it.\"\n\n\"Then name your request,\" came the sinister voice. \n\n\"My life. I will trade my soul for my own life. I want to die,\" I cried. \"I am an immortal. I drank from the Fountain thousands of years ago when Eden still stood. My name is Able and I was never killed.\"\n\nThe shackles binding me to nothing broke free and my feelings returned. An audible gasp came from the creature I could now see standing in front of me. He towered over my small frame by measures, eyes glinting off the ethereal flow around us. Inscriptions dug from the flesh engulfed his body. There were lesions covering his hands and sides and #BADWORDS# oozed frond them slowly and smelling of death. \"What did you say?\"\n\n(First time writing on this subreddit. If this doesn't suck and you want me to continue let me know. Otherwise I'll stop taking up space) haha \n\nEdit to finish:\n\nI tried to bring my eyes to meet the demons but his presence was too powerful. Though I couldn't see them, I could feel more demons appearing around us. In the force of such evil my head began to swim. \n\n\"Leave us, brothers. Immortal he may be but he's still Man. He cannot take our numbers. It will kill him and I have a feeling we want to know this story,\" said the demon. He must have noticed their effect. \n\n\"Go on.\"\n\nMy reply was shaky at first. \"My name is Able. You know me from Eden and the Great Histories. My story is long but it appears we have time for the telling.\" My confidence was growing. \"We both know where the Histories say I died and how I did so. Here's where the Writers got it wrong. They were deceived.\"\n\nThe scene around us changed. We were now in an ancient room. The walls were sandstone and smooth, weathered over the years. Row after row of books lined the floor as far as my eyes could see. In the center was a dias, raised a foot or so above the surrounding area. On this stone dias a beam shone down from the ceiling to rest on a single book sitting on an obsidian stand. The first Bible. \n\n\"Where are we?\" I asked. \n\n\"We are in the library at Alexandria. I need the original words to corroborate your story,\" said the demon. \n\n\"Alexandria? I thought this place was destroyed. I was in the city when it was sacked. I saw this very building go up in flames.\"\n\n\"You saw what we wanted you Men to see. There are uses we have for this knowledge that would have been wasted on the greed of Man. So we destroyed this ancient city and cloaked the Great Library in deep magic to hide it from Man.\"\n\n\"But why are we here? I told you the Great Histories had it wrong.\" I asked rather stupidly. \n\n\"Yes, yes. I did hear you, Man.\" The demons voice was grating. It pained to hear him speak. \n\nA trickle of blood feel from my ear. I reached up and my hand came away red. \n\n\"You must finish this story so a deal can be struck. Man can't remain in our prescience this long. Let's be done with this,\" sneered the demon.\n\n\"Okay. The bible says that my brother, Cain, killed me. That couldn't be farther from the truth. When my parents were cast from Eden they lost the Fountain along with it. My brother and I set out to find it since death scared us. After all, no Man had yet to die.\" \n\nThe demons look became intent. His red eyes boring into my body, reading me to the bone. \n\n\"We made it to the Fountain, only to meet the Serpent guarding the entrance to the cave it was hidden in.\"\n\n(Gotta head to work. I'll keep going if more are interested later on a break or something)\n\nEdit 2:\n\n\"As my brother and I approached the serpent at the entrance, we stopped short of the branch the creature was wrapped upon,\" I said. \n\n\"Lucifer never took the form of a serpent again after he spoke with your parents. Who was the serpent?\" came the demons reply. \n\n\"That I don't know. I am only repeating what happened. The snake struck a deal with my brother and I. He said that only one could enter at the price of the other. Cain, being ever selfless, insisted I go into the cave so I could drink from the Fountain. We argued about the decision for a while but the snake grew bored and suddenly Cain and the serpent was no where to be seen. I was alone.\"\n\n\"I wandered in the cave, fearful of what happened to Cain. After traveling its depths for what seemed an eternity, a light appeared in the darkness. A slow trickle of water could be heard. I approached the Fountain and cupped my hands in its pool. I drank only a moment and there was power coursing through my veins. I knew then I was Immortal.\"\n\nThe demons eyes glinted. \"Is this a trick, Man? If you are truly Immortal and your wish is death, why give me your soul? You must know that an eternity of pain and suffering awaits you after life on earth.\"\n\n\"No trick. I'll finish,\" I said. \"Once I knew my new power, I ventured out into the world to find my family and share with them what Cain and I had discovered. More than anything, I wanted to reunite with him.\"\n\n\"It was then I discovered how much time passed in the cave. Both my father and mother had died and I learned the price the serpent spoke of. He was framed for my murder and cast into Hell because of it. So this is my wish, demon. Go back to the cave and take my life before I can betray my brother. Then you can have my soul.\"\n\n\"You must think me a fool, Man!\" His screech was deafening. It echoed in skull for a lifetime. \"If I grant your wish, your soul would become nothing. It would erase the past! The First Sins wouldn't have been committed and We would have no power on earth!\"\n\nI hung my head. The demon had seen through my plan. \n\nAll around us, fire erupted from the ground. The old darkness creeped into the library and engulfed us. The smell of brimstone filled my nostrils. \n\nA great booming echo filled the emptiness. \"YOU. WILL. PAY.\"\n\nAnd then it was gone. I was back in my old room as it was before I summoned the demon. I had not struck the deal I planned. My curse would remain with me. Powerless to time and lost forever to wander earth until the Return. My brothers name still held the evil the Great Histories had wrought. \n\nWhat I wanted was evil in the eyes of the demons because it was selfless beyond measure. It would have also been their downfall. \n\nHope you guys enjoyed! :)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400220010","downs":0,"edited":"1400250315","gilded":0,"id":"chjbjju","link_id":"t3_25oa3r","name":"t1_chjbjju","parent_id":"t3_25oa3r","retrieved_on":1433819651,"score":47,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":47}

A small dark corridor with a single door presented itself in an unpopulated corner of the mall.  A line had formed outside the Starbucks bathroom and he quietly laughed to himself as he opened opened the door and walked through expecting to find a construction zone for a new store. \n\nAs he turned and faced the room he heard a soft click as the door closed behind him.\n\nA faintly heard buzzing filled the room and the smell of urine pierced his nostrils making the fullness of his bladder more evident. The room was barren save for a timer counting down above a small switch on the wall in front of him. The walls were painted a dark purple and the floor was covered by a soft cream colored rug. The only source of light came from the electronic timer directly in front of him which was counting down from three minutes.\n\n*This can't be right* he thought as he turned back toward the large door, which he hadn't noticed was made of a thick slab of metal as he tried pulling it toward him. It wouldn't budge. He turned back toward the timer. \n\n*2:45*\n\n*#BADWORDS#.*\n\nHis teeth began to ache and he felt as though his bladder was going to pop. The ticking of the timer became evident and more irritating every time it ticked. *tick, tick, tick, tick...*\n\n*Why is that ticking!? It's electronic for God's sake!*\n\nHe turned toward the door to try it again. He locked himself onto the handle and put his right foot up against the wall so that he could lean back and put his body weight into it. He sat there for a few moments, his foot on the wall and his head near the ground, hoping that the door would break open. No luck.  He released his grip and stood himself u#BADWORDS#ht to take a look at the timer.\n\n*1:25*\n\n*Okay, there's got to be a way out of here.*\n\nThe weight on his bladder filled his mind again and he found it unbearable and he decided the only way to curb the feeling was by running. \n\n*A few laps ought to do it.*\n\nStarting slowly he made a lap around the small room in a gallop as if he were injured to make rounding the corners of the small room feasible without stopping. At first his bladder felt worse but after a few more laps his stomach felt more tense and the feeling in his bladder had almost gone completely. He stopped and faced himself toward the timer.\n\n*0:25*\n\n*This is ridiculous*, he thought as he made his way toward the switch underneath the timer. He flipped the switch and the light on the timer went out and the buzzing that once filled the room was now gone. He stood still for a moment, relieved until he heard another *tick* from the wall. His stomach set on fire and he felt a rage like he had never felt before. He switched the light back on and quickly took a look at the timer. *0:06*\n\n*That's it.*\n\nHe ran full speed toward the door harnessing the rage he felt from the helplessness of his situation and let out a leaping shoulder check into the metal door.\n\nHe woke moments later on his back with a few bystanders gathered around looking down at him. He felt a warm puddle underneath his shorts and as he turned his head to the side he saw a construction worker approaching, looking straight toward him.\n\nThe construction worker lifted a two-way radio to his mouth and sighed. \"Everyone better get back here.

{"archived":true,"author":"heavenlypeach","body":"\"You are there,\" the man's words echoed through the reaches of his psyche. Even the bone chill of an empty, hopeless night could not cut through the beacon that somewhere beyond the blind eye and forgetfulness of humanity someone cared.\n\n\"You are there, aren't you?\" He spoke again. Through weak eyes, the streetlamp's dim yellow light cascaded over cement and across asphalt, tracing the outline of a thousand manufactured edges. In his dark corner, hidden from the judgment of those unable to fathom a jagged and broken existence, he traced the road before him he'd seen a thousand times, and waited.\n\nFrom outside his vision a silhouette formed with increasing clarity. Against the backlit landscape the humbleness of a proffered figure appeared.\n\n\"I am here,\" the figure whispered. The voice came as clear and vibrant as the boardwalk music the man had walked to ages ago with his then newlywed wife - a place of hope and warmth and joy. A place too, far, far from reach. \"Why is it you call on me?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"It is these nights, the ones that haunt me, wherein I remember a time long, long ago. Flashes of peace and happiness, of family and work, grace my memories, but fleeting. Their ephemerality serves only as a sad reminder of this sordid state of affairs and sometimes I do not know if the memories are real or just the desperate grasping of a shattered mind.\"\n\nThe figure smiled and bent over the man. \"You are more beautiful than you know. In your des#BADWORDS#ution there is honesty, a life that has seen the innocence of day and the horror of night. Perhaps what images grace your mind are the threads of a message. If you could read them, what might they tell?\"\n\n\"They would mock me saying the caress of a wife, the aspirations of a youth, the hope of a bright future is all but empty. The fall from grace is hard and swift and once it is done, looking up the cliff face from whence one has come is the inference of an all but impossible climb.\"\n\n\"And yet, can your memories - the images of care, affection, and promise - be the bridge between these craggy depths and the place you might one day return?\"\n\nThe man turned away and bowed his head. As vivid as the memory of time spent with his youthful wife and prospect of a family materialized, so too did the memory of her passing wash across him. Despairing, the man thought for a moment, then craned his neck once more to speak again. \"God? What can you know of loss? You are here for me, granted, but I cannot imagine what you must think when you see a man like me. When the world takes away those things which are most important and takes no pity on your subsequent failures, do you truly understand what it is to be lost?\"\n\nThe figure smiled back at the man who now shivered in the sharp midnight winds. Reaching down, the figure placed a soft hand across his stubbled face and for a moment the flowery scent of his late wife graced the man's senses. For a moment in time the two shared their close distance, a connection of two bodies the man had not felt for an immeasurable time. Unaware, the warmth of tears began to run at the sides of his cheeks.\n\nAs the figure rose to leave, the man spoke through a choked and vaulted voice, \"I- I am sorry. When... when will I see you next?\"\n\nIn the light, which now broke across her face, the ethereal visage of his wife turned and looked with warm eyes. \"I will always be with you my love. Be strong and go on.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400273420","downs":0,"edited":"1400273629","gilded":0,"id":"chjtbdn","link_id":"t3_25qe5n","name":"t1_chjtbdn","parent_id":"t3_25qe5n","retrieved_on":1433828341,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

A mul#BADWORDS#ude, filling the rivers from one bank to the other?\" \n\n\"At the time the data was gathered it seemed populous enough to last. Or so I had thought. Obviously I underestimated how bad things had gotten before the end. I'll adjust the assumptions and check the database.\"\n\nFarken adjusted his spectacles to look at the holographic display. \"Ok, let's raise the extinction factor...emphasis on food...\"\n\nHe was an abnormally scrawny man, one part due to childhood malnutrition and the other to his habit of spending days at a time in the lab calculating, measuring and programming, sustaining himself with caffeine-pouches and dunots. I pitied him, in a way: the lab was his whole reason for living; should his application for an internship have been denied he problably would have sold his body for organ replacements. He tapped a button on the monitor and a stream of information flashed up. It was in the old language, English. I knew a few words as an intellectual, but only archaeologists and philosophers studied it with any degree of seriousness anymore. Farken was fluent.\n\n\"Let's see...according to this, rats are our next best shot.\"\n\n\"Rats? Are you sure? I've seen some old pictures of rats from around the time of the exodus. They've changed massively here. From what I've read, rats were mostly less than 3 decimetres long, omnivorous and ground based. Now they swoop down from heights to #BADWORDS# children.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you have to remember the difference in enviromental pressure. Even in pre-exodus literature they were noted as highly adaptable and prevailent, a model of success in selection. Since they lived in local waste levels of 67.9 burns pre-exodus, I'm hoping that the global level of 75 burns wouldn't put too much change pressure on the species.\"\n\n\"Alright. Upload it and run it. Make sure they're thorough, and tell them to exclude genes identical to our rats, there could be some on the ship and I don't want to be picking bits off the ceiling. If this doesn't work, we may have to resort to insects.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Uploading now.\"\n\nHe returned his attention to the computer. I gazed out the portal window at the blue-orange orb, half a million kilometres away, smaller than a datadisk. There was a scale simulation on Farken's holograph display, roughly the radius of an elephant. It's amazing how things can change in a matter of milennia, especially with the enviromental pressures of being suddenly relocated to another planet. Low gravity and higher oxygen levels meant eagles could hold their breaths for half an hour and withstand re-entering the atmosphere, horses were 5 decimetres tall and air-borne, hyper-aggressive rats preyed on spherical elephants shorter than horses. It was comical to read about the way things used to be.\n\nOn the monitor pinpricks, then clusters, then clouds of white appeared as billions of nanobots received their new instructions and waited to carry them out. Eventually the entire planet was covered in a #BADWORDS#logous cloud of white, obscuring the vomit-like colour of the surface and atmosphere. Farken entered the command to commence the scanning.\n\n\"This could take longer. A few hours. Even nanobots can only work so fast. Do you want to do anything in the meantime?\"\n\n\"Set up the entangler. We might as well report so far. How long has it been?\" \n\n\"The computer says...600 years. Do you have anyone in particular you want to speak with?\"\n\n\"I suppose whosoever is in charge of research. Put an identifier on it and call head office, highest priority.\"\n\nThe entangler used quantum entanglement to communicate information to a quantum computer anywhere in the universe instantaneously by altering spin values of paired particles. One of the pair was on the ship and the other half was back home on a reserved line, constantly monitored. It hadn't been used in the last 600 years, and the technology would have inevitably advanced since the relay was set up, but regulations would have ensured it wasn't tampered with.\n\n\"Ah...sir? Sir, I can't reach them. Sir, there's nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing? What do you mean? There can't be nothing, keep checking!\"\n\nThere was nothing. We tried for days, non-stop, each of the crew taking turns to monitor, sending a distress signal every two hours. Nothing. Either regulations had be voided and the machine destroyed, or some worse fate had befallen the planet and there was no longer an office to receive the signal. There was no way to be sure. Our orders stated to remain in orbit until we received a signal telling us to go home. It never came.\n\nWhat did come was the report from the nanobots. They searched the planet for the rat DNA, and found a 67% match. Bear in mind that at the time of the exodus, humans and bananas shared around 50% of their genes. It was two percent above the tolerance limit for similarities. A few days later, approaching hysteria, we carried out a waste test in the atmosphere and oceans. We had estimated 75 burns, but until now we were too wrapped up in DNA syncing to carry out tests. The answer surprised all of us, not least Farken. The overall level was 4 burns, one burn being air quality at the turn of the last inhabited ice age.\n\nWe were left with a decision. We had enough food and supplies for two years of activity, and enough cryosis equipment for the 600 year return journey. We had received no acknowledgement for two weeks, when the line was supposed to be monitored constantly for the last six hundred years. We made a choice. Two of the crew, an engineer and a lab assistant, volunteered to be put into cryostasis and sent home, to investigate the fate of our race. We unloaded the rest of the equipment and supplies, including the entangler, planetside. We would stay, set up camp, investigate and, eventually, populate. We would become pioneers, relearn and adapt to an environment similar to the one in which our ancestors discovered civilisation aeons ago. We would become the ancestors of a race, the genesis of a people settling this brave new world, almost completely unknown to us.\n\nTwelve thousand years since the last wretch of a natural human being breathed his last, we were landing on Earth.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400280732","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chjwder","link_id":"t3_25pnbs","name":"t1_chjwder","parent_id":"t3_25pnbs","retrieved_on":1433829858,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

I had been sitting on this bench for over half an hour staring at the glass doors across the road. They looked frail in comparison to the solid concrete structure they were entrance to.\n\nIt was the third job this month, this one’s name was Alex. She was still alive after a couple of failed hits, the last two guys that were sent hadn’t been since and the bosses were getting a bit, shall we say, concerned. I look down and pull the lid off the coffee I had purchased earlier from a gas station, the colour was a little grey and it smelt burnt but it was warm, I finished it off and tossed into the trash can beside me. I look up and the doors start to swing open, a beautiful girl exits wrapped in what looks like a white mink coat. Her face looks oddly familiar but im not a local so I doubt weve met.\n\nTime to roll, I get up as she quickly trots across the road on the way to the car park a little further down, grab my overcoat and place it across my arm gripped tightly onto my Glock 17. Her heels click and her hair bobs as she walks. As I follow along the concrete pavement my mind begins to wander, I know ive seen that face before, was it last years fundraiser, no not that it’s familiar but not quite the same. I trip and stumble where a tree root has ruptured out through the concrete seemingly searching for some light, I look up and catch Alex’s eyes as her head flicks back around, am I compromised, I stop, grab my phone and make it light up, Alex continues on around the corner, im good, I think.\n\nI quickly try to catch up and make the corner, shes standing leant against the rough brown brick wall, her arm across her body reaching deep into her now open coat, her tight red dress clearly visible. I stop, my hand tightens and my finger starts to press against the trigger, her eyes widen. She lets open her mouth and says my name, it its you she says. I don’t quite understand, how could she know, we must have met before, where though, my mind flips back through faces and i realise, she looks a lot, no it couldn’t be, but she does lookl like my childhood friend.\n\nWe used to play cops in the abandoned house at the back of my parents, she would take turns trying to find and shoot me and I would her. The only thing was she wasn’t real, she was imaginary and it was a long time since I had thought about her. My finger loosens on the trigger as she pulls her arm out of her coat, in her hand a Sig P230. The sound is deafening, I win she says, turns and starts walking away.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400323276","downs":0,"edited":"1400323707","gilded":0,"id":"chk85ot","link_id":"t3_25rr40","name":"t1_chk85ot","parent_id":"t3_25rr40","retrieved_on":1433835479,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Plum_Warrior","body":"Death was a quick jolt similar to a hiccup. I open my eyes and they instantly begin to tear. Before my eyes lies the largest palace that I've ever seen. It seems to be constructed from pure gold and has delicate framework on every crevice. I am able to sit up and I notice that I am lying on the ground before a small marble staircase leading to the entrance. To the sides of the staircase, there are busts scattered about with stern faces filled with scars. The scent of brimstone and ashes fill the air, I attempt to clear my throat but it is so swollen that I can barely swallow. I manage to stand up and walk towards the stairs with the grace of a drunken sailor. A smile comes across my face and I remark to myself, “So this is heaven...” \n\nA gust of wind sweeps me off my feet and I fall onto the steps. “This is not heaven.” A cold voice states sending shivers down my spine. I look towards the direction of the voice. A young man somewhere in his mid-twenties with dark hair and a deep scar down his face stands tall. He is like the busts and startles me when he breaks his pose. He begins to walk towards me and says, “This is Valhalla; resting place of the greatest warriors that Earth has ever seen.”  Well, this is awkward. A nervous smile appears on my face and I try to speak but fail miserably. His stone eyes blink when I begin to stutter and he says, “What have you done to deserve this resting place, fellow hero?” \n\nOh god, he thinks I’m a hero.. I want to evaporate into a cloud and escape this awkward encounter. “I ummm. . . defeated the smurfs.” I stammer instantly regretting it. I’m even terrible at lying. Honestly, I could’ve said the terrorists, world hunger, even the daleks. But I had to freak out again and spout out the first thing on my mind which was oddly enough the smurfs. He smiles “Very well.” He says and helps me stand up. He guides me up the marble staircase and through the golden archways. When we enter there are busts lining the hallway similar to the many different versions of the Beast in the hallways of the Castle in the Beauty and the Beast Disney movie. I notice the scars on these faces as well and we reach the end of the hallway. I look to my “fellow hero” trying to figure out why, when I see it. There is a bust of me! My youthful smile, my horrible haircut, and my fair skin devoid of any imperfections all stare back at me. The warrior stares at the bust in awe as if I actually looked fierce. “How did you conquer an entire race?” he asks me with genuine curiosity. He glares at my face and my skin obviously perplexed about my warriorhood.\n\n I break our staring contest and say, “I had a lot of time and I planned a lot. I really need to see the person in charge.”  He coughs and says, “Of course!” and leads me to a different hallway filled with doors. He nods at me and knocks on a door. I barely have a chance to mentally prepare before he pushes me through the doorway. I snap my head back to scold him but he has already fled. “Hello Warrior.” A gentle voice concedes. \n\nI look and see an old man, he is thin, balding, and wears a set of glasses. Before he has a chance to say anything else I interject, “I think you've made a mistake.” He smiles and gives a slight chuckle. He begins to talk: “Only one. I noticed my mistake too late so now you are sentenced to live here for all eternity. Don’t worry it’s not too bad- There are training facilities, war museums, and bingo Sundays” My mind spirals and I respond: “All eternity? But I’m not a warrior! I’m not even close! How am I supposed to fake the scars that all these heroes have? I’ve never saved a life! Overall, It was a throw up whether I’d even land on the stairway to heaven or highway to hell!” He chuckles harder obviously not sensing my frustration. \n\n“Then make yourself useful, a good warrior will show others how to follow as well as how to lead. It is your job for the rest of eternity to learn what warrior you should have been.” ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400373827","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chko3jg","link_id":"t3_25tm81","name":"t1_chko3jg","parent_id":"t3_25tm81","retrieved_on":1433843120,"score":54,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":54}

Today had been a normal day, so why did I feel like something was wrong? I turned my head and, with a sigh of frustration, stared outside my window. All that was revealed to me was a street light, tree branches, and beyond that, the black sky. I let my mind wander, trying to ignore the light from outside, trying to ignore the dancing branches outside my window. I let the ticking of the clock slowly draw me further into its methodical song. My eyes opened. I didn't have a clock. I looked outside, the tree branches shaking; there was no wind, either. \n\nA sound like a palm being rubbed quickly against wood grew and grew until it was deafening. I stared at the foot of my bed, neither fear nor any other emotion other than happiness flooding my mind, and there at the end of my bed arose a large man who was wrapped in a wonderful white dress that shimmered with thousands and thousands of jewels and gold stones. He crossed his thick, hairy arms and stared down at me, *harrumphing* once but saying nothing more.\n\nWe stared for eternity, until finally I cleared my throat. \n\nHe stared. \n\nI smiled. With him standing there, I felt that I could take on the universe. \"Who are you?\" \n\nHe nodded, frowning. \"That is what I expected from you, but I think you already know who I am.\"\n\n\"But I don't believe in you.\" \n\n\"Yes.\" He opened his arms wide and, his face lighting up with a smile, shrugged. \"But here I am.\" He put a hand up to stifle the next words out of my mouth. \"I know. It's all shocking for you, trust me, I know. The fact that I am here means everything you believe is wrong.\" He frowned again. \"For now.\" \n\n\"What... that's not possible... you...\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed. \"Stop. I am here. Think carefully and throw away the useless words. Say what you mean.\" \n\nI thought. Yes, I suppose I did know. I knew he was god, I knew that he *existed*, that god actually *existed* and he was visiting me because... \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"Ah.\" He nodded somberly and sat down at the foot of my bed. The bed trembled and shook at the touch of the creator of everything. \"I am here because you have reached what I like to call the Point of No Return.\" He chuckled. \"I think somebody made a movie out of that.\" He stopped, but I had no desire to interrupt what he had to say. \"Very well. I am here because you do not believe in me. That much you have made clear.\" He sighed. \"Now is when you make the decision.\" \n\n\"For what?\" \n\n\"Now is when you decide to,\" he held up a finger, \"one, begin to believe in me and do what I ask of you, or...\" he held up a second finger, \"two, you can refuse to believe in me and I will leave, and you will never, ever, in all of eternity ever see me again.\"\n\nHe kept the fingers up, and I stared at them, the room seeming to tumble and spin around us. I thought, and waited, thought some more, then waited some more. \n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That's it?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" He wiggled the two fingers. \"Which will it be?\" \n\n\"What happens if I choose to believe in you? Will I gain anything?\" \n\nHe frowned. \"You will gain *me*.\" \n\n\"But what about the benefits, the cons?\" \n\nHe stood and stared down at me, and I felt my soul within me cower. \"*I am*.\" \n\nI waited until I could find the strength to speak again. \"Will my life be the same?\" \n\n\"If you choose to believe in me, then I will be with you. If you choose not to believe, I will not be with you.\" \n\nI thought then of my life with him, and then without him. I thought of every possibility. \"If I die not believing in you?\" \n\nHe shrugged. \"You're done.\" \n\nIn that moment, even then, while I felt the presence of my creator--that feeling of utter and complete peace and understanding--I knew what to do. \"I choose not to believe.\" \n\nHe stared for a long while, his eyes gazing into mine, the world around us frozen in time. Finally he blinked and nodded. \"Very well. You are on your own.\" \n\n\"Wait--will I remember anything about this?\" \n\nHe looked down at me, his eyes full of compassion and sorrow. \"You have decided.\" He vanished. \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400383331","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chkrbag","link_id":"t3_25u2hv","name":"t1_chkrbag","parent_id":"t3_25u2hv","retrieved_on":1433844704,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

{"archived":true,"author":"glittery_unicorns","body":"Marie examined John carefully.  He was young, in his mid to late 20's with dark, dirty hair.  His clothes were torn and poorly s#BADWORDS#ched where previous holes had existed, resulting in his shirt being uneven at the bottom.  They looked like they had seen better days.  In contrast, Marie was an elderly women, around her late 60's early 70's with arthritis in her joints, and experienced daily chronic pain.  She was a kind woman, her face was stern, a reminder of her former position as a judge.  \n\n\"Are you sure you want to go through with this?\" Marie asked, making sure that John would not change his mind.\n\n\"I'm sure.  You wiling to stick to the agreement? $10,000 each month in which I endure all of your pain, and you cover my wedding expenses - ring and all.\"  John confirmed. \n\n He needed this.  He loved his girlfriend and wanted her to have the best wedding available.  A little amount of pain for her childhood dreams was worth it.  She would never know.  The ten grand would help him rent an apartment, a shoddy place, but it would be better than the homeless shelters they were staying in, until they could afford to buy their own house.  He could buy her new clothes, a hair cut, and everything else he had wanted but never could afford to give her.\n\n\"And nobody must know\" Marie said.  The legal repercussions for going through with this would harm both of them.  John would lose everything if he wasn't careful, as well as spend years in jail.  Marie would lose her job instantly and if her colleagues were kind, that would be all that she would lose.\n\nJohn nodded and walked with her to one of the metal chairs.  He sat down and the assistant firmly strapped him in.  The assistant looked at him, the disgust perfectly masked.  What people would do for money...\n\nMarie would sit in her chair and was also strapped in.\n\nJohn could see the appeal for this procedure - no longer go through pain for a couple thousand a month depending on the person to feel decades younger.  To no longer have to feel the pain of age.  After both parties were secured, the assistant would leave the room to get the doctor.\n\n\"Hello Marie, hello John\" the doctor said cheerfully.\n\"Now, are either of you familiar with the procedure?\" he paused, looking for some feedback. \"I guess not.  Well, essentially we obtain your subjective experience of pain and place it into John's brain.  Even if there are no physical problems, John will feel your pain.  You wont feel his pain however, so the link is only partial.  You'll be able to resume your normal lives.  John, we will supply you with the necessary medication monthly, as courtesy of Marie's contribution for this project.  There are no physical side effects, outside of experiencing Marie's pain.  Of course, you will not experience Marie's pain if she stubbed her toe.  That being said, Marie, you will experience pain for a day if you happen to be stabbed, shot, break a bone, and so on.  However, after that day the pain will be transferred to John.  This is to ensure that Marie will know something had happened to her and obtain treatment.  Also, we can't have people stabbing themselves at parties because it doesn't hurt them.  While this procedure is illegal, I am first - and foremost a doctor.  Are there any questions?\"\n\n\"What happens if I were to die?\" Marie asked.  She did not want anything bad to happen to John in case that were to happen - given her age.\n\n\"Nothing will happen.  The connection would be cut and all services are rendered obsolete.  John will no longer experience your previous pain, as well, John will not feel what it is like to die.\"\n\n\"Is it reversible?  If I were to say I wanted out, or if Marie wanted out, could we?\"  John asked, wanting to make sure all bases were covered.\n\n\"Yes.  Both of you will have to come back to have the procedure reversed.  Further, you cannot transfer somebody's pain to another individual.  You can only transfer your own pain to that individual.  Remember, Marie's pain is not your own.\"\n\nJohn nodded.  He could do this, he was young and only had to endure the pain for only a few years before he thought Marie would suc#BADWORDS#b to time.  He could do this.\n\nHe looked at Marie and nodded, seeing relief fill her eyes as the doctor pulled the lever to the machine.  It hummed softly in the once silent room.  At first, he felt nothing, then gradually his joints began to annoy him, provoking a desire to crack them.  A few minutes later he discovered why most adverti#BADWORDS#ts for arthritis was common, the pain inhibited him from wanting to accomplish anything, from wanting him to move.  The procedure ended and Marie stood up, looking as if she had lost 10 years.  She looked at John apologetically.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be paid in full and then some.  I know what you're going through and I'll make sure it'll be easy for you.  You'll have the best wedding you could have ever asked for.\" Marie said firmly, gently touched his hand and left.\n\nJohn looked at the doctor before slowly climbing out of the bed.  His body hurt in ways he could never imagine.  The doctor handed him some medication and a glass of water.\n\n\"Take this, it'll help.  If it's any consolation, Marie will do everything she can to ensure you'll live as comfortably as possible.  She is a remarkably kind woman.   You wouldn't think that, considering her family, but she has contributed a lot to helping children and the less privileged.  You got lucky with this one.  I've seen people take on horrendous amounts of pain for less.\"\n\nJohn nodded and slowly left after the pain slightly subsided.  The only thing he was thinking about was what ring to buy his girlfriend.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400430236","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chl2513","link_id":"t3_25t5p7","name":"t1_chl2513","parent_id":"t3_25t5p7","retrieved_on":1433849874,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"university_deadline","body":"*The man snored peacefully. All around him the machinery continued to whir and click, constantly purifying the air and recycling it. On the desk there was a single counter that was slowly ticking up through the low thousands. For the longest time the meaning behind it had been forgotten to all but the man.*\n\n*Somewhere above him the light flickered and went out. If anyone had been awake they would have looked at it with some worry and made a note. That was Rule 19: Report ANY system failure.*\n\n*In the darkness the machine clicked again, then clattered, straining against some blockage. It was a coarse, grinding sound, and the man jumped from his sleep. This was the very reason he had been stationed here. He was the Watcher and everyone trusted him to make sure this didn't happen.*\n\n*He staggered to the console in the blackness, feeling around for the emergency release lever.*\n\n*He couldn't see it, but the numbers had stopped counting up.*\n\n–\n\n“We have a problem.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Oxygen filter went out.”\n\n“Christ, here?”\n\n“No. Monitoring station B.”\n\nChina visibly relaxed. She was lounging in a worn leather chair and playing a game of cards. The pictures on the front intrigued her and she would happily sit and flip them time and time again, battling her way through countless games of Solitaire. The game had been one she'd found in a water-bloated book down on level seventeen. The rules didn't seem to make a lot of sense – she had no idea why Jack was subservient to whatever a “Queen,” was, or why they weren't just numbers like the rest of the cards – but it kept her entertained until something happened.\n\nUsually that would take a while.\n\n“Then what's the fuss?”\n\nTam shrugged. He was a mousy kid with sickly white hair and a deathly pale complexion. It was a common illness around these parts and one that the doctors were quick to dismiss. They said it was normal but there would always be supers#BADWORDS#on and that was usually enough. These days Tam was an outcast. It would only get worse as the illness continued to rob him of his colour.\n\n“You know how the boss gets, China. He's wanting an inspection.”\n\n“Great.” The sarcasm dripped out of her voice. “Who's on the crew?”\n\n“Well there's me. And then there's you,” Tam said, counting on his fingers. He stopped at two. \n\n“No one else?”\n\n“Not one. We've got use of the buggy, should only be a twenty minute round trip, plus the time it takes to actually check the place out.”\n\n“Guess we'd best get moving then.”\n\n–\n\nMonitoring station B was one of the two surface buildings that was inside the compound. The reason for it had never been fully explained to either China or Tam, but they had been told that it was vital. So why there were only two people being sent to make sure that it was in working order weighed heavily on China's mind, especially as one was a fifteen year old bad luck charm.\n\n“Tell me something,” she said, moving the buggy around a collapsed metal pole, “This doesn't strike you as strange?”\n\nHer voice crackled over the radio, transmitting through the few short feet of smog with some difficulty. The rebreather clicked with every breath, further garbling the message. Somehow Tam got this rough meaning and thought about it for a second.\n\n“Not really. Equipment malfunction, could be dangerous. And we are Unattached.”\n\nThere was that term again. The bunker could only house a hundred people at any one time, and the people that had no family, the ones who were 'Unattached,” were considered disposable. That was just a fact of life.\n\nShe slowed the buggy at the airlock. The two of them dismounted and made their way inside. \n\n–\n\nThey were in total darkness.\n\nThe airlock had failed, going into lockdown and sealing the entire building away from the outside world. When they pried it open thick fingers of fog snaked their way in alongside the two kids.\n\n“Headlamps going on,” China muttered, “Starting the recording if that's okay, Tam?”\n\n“Go for it. Let's just make it quick.”\n\n“Okay... So, date is... Something. I forget, I'll add that to the end of the tape when we get back. Distress call came in about an hour ago. Took us some time to get suited and booted and then we hit the god-forsaken surface. Now we're in Monitoring Station B and the power is out. Looks like total failure.”\n\n“Also looks like we have a body.”\n\n“#BADWORDS#. Who is it?”\n\n“Don't know, haven't seen him. I guess he was one of the older ones, though. Looks like he died writing something.”\n\n“A'ight.” China spoke back into the recorder. “We have an unidentified corpse. Assuming he died when the power went down, probably the smog. Station seems entirely dead, no hint as to what was going on out here.”\n\n“You might want to take that back and read this,” Tam said, lifting a notebook. China looked at it “He was writing in it when he died.”\n\n“What's it say?”\n\n“It's a bit of a scrawl. Says... *To the one that comes after me. I'm sorry they've sent you out here. They told me I had to check the station out and repair it about ten years ago. It's not a bad life and I'm sure you'll get used to it. Everything you need to get this place up and running again is in the back. They'll send food up daily through the tube you'll find there too.*\n\n*“The reason you're up here is to monitor the population of the bunkers. There's a whole network of them out there and you need to be the ones that share the information between them. There's some other things, the pollution needs to be measured every day and recorded. So far it hasn't gone down in all the time I've been up here. One day it will and we'll be glorified as the ones that kept the difficult watch.*\n\n*“We have books and films from before the fall. All in all it isn't a bad life.”*\n\nTam lowered the book and began to cry.\n\n--\nJust a note: I'd love to come back to this story and edit it to be a lot cleaner, but it's almost 1am and work will be sad with me if I'm not there tomorrow.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400456411","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chlcmpw","link_id":"t3_25w0o0","name":"t1_chlcmpw","parent_id":"t3_25w0o0","retrieved_on":1433854882,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

I'd never met someone so passionate. Someone who knew exactly what they wanted and wasn't afraid to come out and ask for it. Don't get me wrong, this is not a sexual thing. It's a personality thing.

The setting was intimate, small table, candles, place settings worthy of a Michelin star. The cutlery was sparkling sterile and freshly sharpened.

That's exactly what it was as I severed the three fingers of my left hand at the metacarpal, from ring to index.

But sometimes they fed me food too substantial for a mere s#BADWORDS#. On those days, I might get a fork. Once I got a lovely little carafe of butter. I kept both, the butter made all of my treasures vibrant and shiny. \n\nBut this day, it wasn't food and there were definitely no new treasures. It wasn't the panel opening at all. It was the entire door! My eyes widened in fear and my lungs seized up. As a man stepped through it, I squeezed myself as tightly as possible in to the corner. *It was him.* The covers proved an ineffective defense and the porter had no issue pulling me from bed and down the hall. \n\nHe brought me to the medical examination hall, skipping Dr Husel's office entirely. I dug my heels in to the floor and refused to move further. The porter looked at me with concern, but *I* knew it was false and my eyes spun wildly as I tried to escape. I did not want to disappear, like every other person who had been taken there. The porter called to a nurse to bring him a needle. \n\nI saw that he had to ask and wait for his treasures too, and I sneered at him. He was no better than me. I pulled harder. He had no right to try and control me. The nurse handed the porter the needle, he plunged it in to my arm and held me as I slipped to the floor. \n\nI woke up in Dr. Husel's office, he smiled at me and I looked in dismay at the bandage on the inside of my arm. \n\n\"I understand you didn't want to get your blood work done today,\" he said in his calm voice. I glared at him. \n\n\"You know you're the same as me too,\" I stated. Dr. Husel raised his eyebrows. I knew he was hiding a smile. Laughing at me again. \"Your treasures are people, but you still have to ask for them and you still have to wait for them. You couldn't do this by yourself. You're no better than I am either.\" I sat back triumphantly, certain these words of truth were my freedom. Dr. Husel sighed again.\n\n\"You are entirely correct my dear, this place would not function without all of its parts. I would be just a man on the street if not for this building and its people. But even more than that, I would not function properly if not for all the parts of myself. Once again, you are correct, we are the same. You can't function without all of your parts either.\" His voice was calm, and I felt closer to victory. \n\n\"You see? Exactly the same!\" I laughed. He nodded solemnly. \n\n\"Yes, very much the same. Except you are missing something, just one little thing. It's something that we all need in our brain, so it can stay balanced and healthy. That is why we give you medicine, do you remember that?\" His voice was still gentle, but his eyes had grown concerned. I wanted to believe that meant he was afraid I would catch him at lying. But it wouldn't stick, it just didn't make quite enough sense. \n\nI realized, suddenly, that they must have found my treasures. I looked at the ground. \"You found them, didn't you?\" \n\n\"No,\" he said even more gently, \"we didn't have to. The attendants knew they had given you a s#BADWORDS#, and that a s#BADWORDS# didn't come back. This was always true, there was never a time they didn't notice that you had kept it.\" This was something that did make sense, and I felt a little bit dizzy.\n\nAgain, I wanted to think they were brain washing me, tricking me in to walking to my death compliantly. But there was another possibility, and it made a little more sense. \"Did you give me medicine?\" I asked in no more than a whisper. \n\nDr. Husel looked at me intently, hope surfacing in his eyes, and said \"yes.\" I nodded. It did make the most sense. I felt dizzy again and closed my eyes. \"Do you know why you stopped taking it?\" I shuddered, tears coming in to my eyes, and nodded. \n\n\"It makes me forget about my treasures.\" \n\n\"Yes, and those are very important. But so is your medicine, and so am I. You're correct that we are all the same. To do anything at all, we all need help from someone else, or something else. Right now you need that from the right balance of medication and strong therapy. Let's try again now, shall we?\" Dr Husel smiled and picked up his notepad.\n\nI nodded, and so began my 25th therapy session at the Regional Mental Health Ins#BADWORDS#ute. \n\n[CC -006]","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400526307","downs":0,"edited":"1400526722","gilded":0,"id":"chlz0t4","link_id":"t3_25yk6o","name":"t1_chlz0t4","parent_id":"t1_chlxlrf","retrieved_on":1433865847,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

Someone had been squatting there, helpfully. Holes had been patched for her, Solar Still for water and power. It had a rough old dock, rotten cheap pine, but it would do. Little boat at the beach-top, quick-to-tear nets, broken rods. If she needed a maggot she dug through the rotting things.\n\nIt might have been a church, once. No building on this continent was old enough to called Gothic, but the imitation was popular in churches and other such places. She imagined it was, actually. The roof wasn't tall, but arched and barreled none the less towards the center. Her sleeping bag laid on a dais, raised three steps above the rest. There was a staircase past a door that spiraled up for seven steps then stopped. Some Natural Fury spun through here and took the rest off. If might have been crawling up to a higher floor, but she doubted it: The Ceilings were too old.\n\nSometimes she stood at the top of those steps, seven up, hand white on edge of the wall, cheap plaster digging itself into her palm, and stared out at some storm or cloud and wondered whatever happened to the Squatter that had been here before her.\n\nDied, probably. Maybe he stared into the water too long and decided it was better in than out.\n\nThe TV was new, brought last month, along with some new kind of micro-wind turbine that made it worthwhile. The television sat there, bathed in the red LEDs of the cheap lights she had never got round to replacing. She had, in all fact, a set of whites sitting in on the back seat of her old LSV. They had been sitting there three months now.\n\nThe TV was on. It can't have been on all that long: She knew the weather round here. Batteries would be drained. And yet it was on, and the batteries were full.\n\nShe stood, Coat drawn heavy about her knees, left side dug down by the pistol, her hand clamped down over it.\n\nOne minute, two, she considered walking back to her old Israeli LSV and driving back, never coming back.\n\nShe knew she couldn't. This was heaven, for her at least. She supposed that meant Heaven had been debased a few times since she last thought about it.\n\nSo she dragged the pistol upwards and flicked the safety off, swept through the dank corner to corner, starting and ending in the red banner of some TV news program.\n\nShe tailed her way back to the TV to the final sallow tones of the Weatherman.\n\n\"And now in traffic news, major delays are expected shortly on all major roots due to a spate of spontaneous collisions, believed to be caused by hackers utilising an exploit yes#BADWORDS#ay uncovered in the radar sensors of several makes of commonly used car autopilot systems...\"\n\nThe view switched to a montage: Mostly big targets: Cargo haulers difficult to stop and with overworked, likely sleeping riders. They'd turned to a man sideways and tipped, blocking the routes at vital points: Bridges, Ridges, Mountain roads.\n\n\"In a statement released toda-\"\n\n\"Back.\" That was her voice wasn't it.\n\n\"Stop.\" There she was again.\n\nIt looked like her's didn't it. Old, Israeli LSV. Weapons replaced, Jerry Can slung around the back. Her's had flaking paint as well. It couldn't be hers, of course. She was sitting here on some damp cushion, turning on a hot-plate with her right hand, and that other person's was crumpled there, roll-bars sheared, caved in enough to scratch the motors.\n\nThe timestamp, then, had to be wrong. She knew that road, she had stared out as she drove across it, after this timestamp told her this other LSV had crashed into the top of the ruined Hauler.\n\nShe vomited. Collapsed to her knees, elbows thudding against the rug, remains of the... Whatever she'd ate thundering through her throat, acid clawing at the roof of her mouth.\n\nShe could feel her heart throwing itself forward again and again, whipped back every time by her ribs.\n\n*She hadn't, she hadn't, she hadn't, that hadn't been her corpse she saw! But it was, it was it was! Ratty old Black Coat, Olive Coveralls, Black hair that wasn't hers.*\n\n*What?*\n\nAnd with that her mind was wrenched away, and she couldn't feel her clothes against her back, only cable and trailing air...\n\n---\n\nShe'd vomited here too, cheap paper shift, fortunately. They were in a coffin hotel, the Old Kent if she remembered.\n\nShe breathed through her nose, then remembered why she shouldn't. She felt the static rolling down her back as Kurdish pulled the cables from her back. Her neck came last and then she collapsed backwards, last gasps of the Amphetamines, THC and the Opiates breaking down in her Bloodstream, Geiger Counter cracking like crazy.\n\nShe'd shower in a minute.\n\n\"How do I know Kurdish?\"\n\n\"How'd you know what?\" She replied, spit-polishing some pistol so she could dull it again. She'd folded her legs under her on the futon, one eye never leaving the door.\n\n\"That this ain't the same as in there? I had a holiday home, back near where I grew I think. Old Church, seashore, ratty old thing and ratty old boat. I... Called it heaven. It was real. Until I saw myself dead on a TV. How do I know that I won't walk outside and see my autopsy on a Billboard, and then wake up again?\"\n\n\"That was did your stomach in?\"\n\n\"...Yeah.\"\n\n\"You don't.\" With that, Kurdish stowed the pistol she'd been dulling, worked herself up, slotted her arms underneath her Shoulders, hooked her arms back to drag her towards the Wet Room.\n\n\"So you gotta *Live*, Angie, Wherever you find yourself. If this is the real world, and you're unique in that cradle in your back and the new glands shoved under your collarbones... Make the best of it. If this is another fake, and I dissolve with your Autopsy report or whatever it is... Make the best of it.\"\n\n\"Now come on Angie. Have a shower, and then we're finding another Hotel.\"\n\n\"Did I do it?\"\n\n\"Yah. Hotel systems are yours now. They don't know a thing.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Sleep felt like a nice next thing.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400533495","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chm2c1t","link_id":"t3_25xll2","name":"t1_chm2c1t","parent_id":"t3_25xll2","retrieved_on":1433867415,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"Lawyerator","body":"Last Thursday around three I decided that I had had enough of the work week and walked to the bar nearest to my office building with the intention of throwing half a dozen or so drinks down my throat. I had never been to the place before, but sometimes you just have to blank your mind out for a while. \n\nI work downtown for a large corporation where my life gets systematically drained dry through tracking and charting endless time usage statistics for reports that are either immediately chucked in the trash or are returned to me with too many uppercase letters and exclamation points to be justifiable on topics like formatting and chart-color-usage. So sometimes I play hooky. I never thought it would work so easily after college, but nobody really pays enough attention to miss me. \n\nI opened the door. I had to let my eyes adjust to the darkness for a few seconds. The place smelled like a college party house ba#BADWORDS#t. Stale beer, cigarettes, and a hint of vomit. It was a dive bar through and through (complete with an old faded out rear projection TV and assorted group photos that mysteriously stopped at 1993). The only other customer in there was a small grey-haired man with a giant can of Coors who apparently was missing more than a few teeth. \n\nI realized that it was technically spring and resolved to drink something #BADWORDS#uely tropical. I looked at the bartender (overweight, over-forty, not quite bald) and immediately recognized that anything with more than two ingredients was out of the question. \n\n“Could I get a rum and pineapple juice?” I asked.\n\n“What kind of rum ya want? He retorted. \n\n“Whatever’s cheapest.”\n\nI started a tab with my credit card and took a sip of the drink. Not bad. Sort of like tropical paint thinner. I took a bigger gulp and let the chemical warmth flow out from my stomach and into my veins. I wasn’t going to care about anything for the rest of the day. \n\nOver the next hour and a half I drained three of the same drinks and was working on a fourth when nature called. I ambled to the men’s room and saw two urinals to the left. I took the taller one (no sense in trusting my aim on the short one three drinks in). There were two cig butts in the urinal drain. Classy. I couldn’t hold back a smile; I was actually impressed by how filthy the place was. \n\nI flushed (watching the butts bob up and down on the current) and walked to the sink to wash my hands. I slipped on something greasy on the floor and had to catch myself on the sink. I looked down at the floor. Red. Quite a bit of red. I must have missed it coming in. It trailed under the door of the lone stall. The stall door was closed. Someone could be hurt in there. \n\n“Hey, are you all right in there?” I asked. \n\nNo response. I realized that I hadn’t seen anyone else come into the bar since I got there over an hour ago, and the old man was still nursing his beer when I got up to take a leak. Someone could be dead in there. \n\nI nervously took a few steps back to angle a look under the door. No shoes, just more red. I didn’t know whether to be relieved or not. Clearly something strange was going on here. I pulled on the stall door. It was locked. I briefly looked back at the men’s room door, but curiosity got the best of me and I fished a coin out of my pocket to turn the stall lock. When the bolt was turned the door swung open on its hinges. \n\nNothing was there. Dirt, red, and an old residential toilet that hadn’t been cleaned in a decade. I looked back at the men’s room door and again at the stall. And there it was. A shadow, just peeking out from behind the tank. I tiptoed across the blood so I’d have less to wipe off later and grabbed for the object. It was small black cloth pouch duct taped to the toilet. Whatever was inside felt heavy, maybe metallic? There was a zipper on the side and by this point I had to know. \n\nIt was a revolver. I checked the cylinder. Five out of six were full. \n\nSuddenly there was shouting back in the bar. Two people, both very angry. One of them sounded like the bartender. The other one couldn’t have been the Coors drinker. I heard someone yell something that sounded like “bathroom” before the voices stopped. I had just enough time to look over my shoulder as the men’s room door flew open with squeal. \n\n“WHAT THE #BADWORDS#!!?” He yelled while reaching into his jacket.\n\nThat’s at least an appropriate use of uppercase and exclamation points, I thought as I clicked the revolver’s cylinder back into place and leveled the weapon at the apparent grammarian. \n\nHe froze. He had slicked back blond hair, a beard, and was wearing a black leather jacket. His hand moved slowly out from his jacket and slightly up into the air. His other hand went up too. \n\n“H-Hang on there, man. You don’t wanna do that.” He half pleaded and half commanded. \n\n“Why not?” I asked.\n\n“You know who I work for! They’re not gonna let you get away with this!”\n\n“I know exactly who you work for.” I had no clue, but the rum had done its work and I wanted to play around for a little while before letting the guy go. “It’s why I’m here,” I said and immediately realized my mistake. \n\nSome ancient military genius, Sun Tzu I think, had some saying about always letting your enemy have what appears to be a way out, lest they fight with the courage of the doomed. I saw doom on his face and knew what was going to happen before he even made a move. His right hand flicked toward his coat and had just enough time to pull out a handle before all five of my bullets thundered into his chest. \n\nHe fell down dead. I grabbed his gun, a 9mm auto, and put it in my waistband. If this guy was part of some criminal group, the bartender was probably in on it too. I got low to the floor and opened the men’s room door to peek out. Nobody was there. No bartender and no old man. They must have high-tailed it when they heard the shooting. I left the bathroom and quickly checked around to be sure that nobody else was there. Nothing. I had a little luck going for me at least. \n\nI crossed the bar and peeked out the front door. Nothing but sidewalk in either direction. I ducked back in, put the revolver opposite the automatic in my waistband, and stepped outside. After a few steps walking toward my car I broke into a jog. I was at a dead sprint by the time I got to the parking lot and, once I got into the car, peeled out of there as quickly as my #BADWORDS# Hyundai hatchback would take me. \n\nI drove for about an hour or two before I had calmed down enough to drive home. I was alive. I was going to be okay. Then it hit me: I forgot to grab my credit card on the way out of the bar. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400624119","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chn07nl","link_id":"t3_262558","name":"t1_chn07nl","parent_id":"t3_262558","retrieved_on":1433883671,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"PenumbraTime","body":"Watching back through my old tapes, I noticed something strange. There was always some small difference than what I remembered - a few words off, or there were less people in the background. I simply shrugged it off. As I pulled out a cassette case labled 'Vietnam', I got thrown back into the days. I never saw the report put on television, the barracks didn't have reliable power and I didn't ever get the time to see it when I got back.  \nPopping it in I saw a strange sight. It started with the reporter with a lit up face and strong troops marching in the background. From what I remember all the soldiers were on the frontlines. We were losing at that point. The reporter's hair was messy and their clothes were muddy, yet in the footage they looked like new.  \n\"It's certainly taking a new direction, and we're hoping to stop the invasion within a few weeks!\"  \nThat's not what she said at all. I might be losing my mind. But I remember it so well. Everything about the situation over there was on its last leg. The tape ended with a small fade in of God Bless America, and promptly ended.  \nI pulled out another tape named 'War on Terror'. It seemed like that was the last footage I ever took, yet it was a lifetime ago. The dusty sand and run down buildings were nothing new.  I noticed myself standing, and couldn't take my eyes away from the television. I saw lies. Living in the harshness of the Middle East had taught me about how America is seen. And yet the insight I gained was not told through the screen. It wasn't even the same reporter!  \nIt was all so familiar, but all wrong.  \nFinishing the tape, I found that I had failed my one goal. To tell the truth to people. They trusted *me*, and I had failed them. had it been my fault? my mind is racing, i cant think straight. switching to the news, I glimpsed the face of a reporter. as always, there was something off. no one had changed it. nothing was wrong. the only difference, was that the camera had decided what it wanted to see.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400814039","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"choyvwy","link_id":"t3_268pl1","name":"t1_choyvwy","parent_id":"t3_268pl1","retrieved_on":1433917552,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"sexquipoop69","body":"The Atmospheric entry had been harrowing to say the least. The transport vehicle, although not designed for this function, performed adequately enough.  There was some damage upon landing but it was minimal and should be repairable.  Shiaru had set the pod down in a field of tall plants that could possibly be corn or maybe grass.  I had run a few atmospheric tests and it appeared as though the air content and radiation levels were within habitable range.  I had Shiaru pull up the most current map data regarding the existing Earth colonies.  \n\nThe United Consortium had long ago stopped any data collection on the inhabitants who referred to themselves as \"the pure\" or \"the people.\"  Of course we called them \"the dying ones\" or the or simply \"the mortals\".  I was born after the war.  From what I had been taught it had come as a surprise to most..on both sides.  There had certainly been tension building over the preceding years and our disagreements had become more passionate.  We had decided to split as a species in the late 21st century.  This had been an attempt at a peaceful resolution but as is often the case the separation had led to inequality of resource distribution which in hindsight could have been avoided.  Our leaders had already been planning an exodus from the quickly diminishing planet.  After 3 years of fighting our side realized that we as a species had lost our taste for war and we rushed our evacuation plans.  I suppose once you get used to the idea of living forever, it's hard to volunteer yourself to be put in harms way.  The mortals never lost this ability to overcome their fear of death and if anything fought harder when pushed to the edge of life.  We were beat before the fighting even began. \n\nShiaru followed me out of the pod hatch.  I stepped for the first time in my life onto the green and brown surface of Earth, home of my supposed enemies.  Shiaru like me was part of the first group to be born in space. We were both clones intended to replace those lost in the battles. I had been made well aware of my forerunner's exploits and personality.  It wasn't until I was around age 10 that it was accepted that clones did not end up with the personality of those they were created from.  Many of us found ourselves orphaned by families who despised us.  We looked exactly like their loved ones, were designed to replace them, but could not actually replace them.  We told different jokes, liked different songs and had different memories.  It was a very hard time for Shiaru and myself. This was how our bond began initially.  \n\nAs I took her hand in mine and we both stepped fully out into this world which our species hadn't seen in half a millennia the wind almost knocked us over.  It was surprising that it could be so forceful. The heat was oppressive and damp.  I  felt as if I was in a shower room, the stifling dampness weighing you down.  I started to sweat almost immediately.  I had never sweat while not performing strenuous activity so this also was new.  We began to walk eastward.  Our steps were labored and difficult, the full weight of the atmosphere upon us, but this at least we had expected. We crested a small hill, breathing heavily, and before us the land fell away.  Upon the horizon, the first real earth horizon I had ever witnessed, the sun was rising.  It lit the forest before us in a golden light that I had never imagined even in my dreams.  Shairu said it was beautiful.  I told her that it was and that she was too.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1400936098","downs":0,"edited":"1400942901","gilded":0,"id":"chpyyfh","link_id":"t3_26coy5","name":"t1_chpyyfh","parent_id":"t3_26coy5","retrieved_on":1433934882,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

{"archived":true,"author":"DalekPlumber","body":"My first thought was, \"What has this world come to?\" But that was before.\n\nAfter my cellmate Jeff (tax fraud, nice guy, not very funny) was released I was given a new one. I was a bit anxious to find out what he was like. There was some hard people in that prison and I wasn't one of them. Well, the day finally came and *what has this world come to?* My new cellmate was to be a six-year-old boy. \n\n\"What is this, a #BADWORDS# joke?\" I asked the guard escorting him. \"He's just a child for christ's sake!\" \n\nThe guard just looked at me, \"He deserves to be here as much as anyone else.\" And shoved the kid into my cell. \n\nHe didn't look scared, or sad or anything like that. He just looked kind of bewildered to be where he was. \n\n\"Hey bud... You alright?\" I had no idea what to say to him.\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah I'm fine I guess. What's your name mister?\" \n\n\"My name? My name uh... My name is John. What's yours, kid?\"\n\nThe kid's eyes lit up, \"Mine too! My name is John!\" Then he got serious again. like kids do, trying to appear older, \"I like to be called Jake though.\"\n\nI laughed at that. \"Jake it is. Why're you here Jake?\"\n\nHis face got dark at that and he turned away from me. \n\n\"You don't have to tell me. It's alright. What do you want to talk about Jake?\"\n\nAfter that we talked all night. We stayed up late and talked about everything. We played word games. When other prisoners would yell \"SHUT THE #BADWORDS# UP!\" because we were being too loud, we would shout back in unison, \"NO YOU SHUT UP, BUTTFACE!\" And then laugh like a couple of carefree kids, instead of the inmates that we really were. \n\n*\n\nWe became fast friends. I thought I could offer him a little protection. Make sure he didn't run into any trouble that he should have to deal with himself. I was not right. \n\nOne day in the cafeteria (lukewarm vomit and *something* green for lunch today) the goddamn neo-Nazis got to me in line. Those sons of #BADWORDS# don't even need a reason. They just come by a ruff you up a bit if they feel like it. More than a bit if no one's around. People were around today so I was okay, if a bit ruffed up. \n\nI went to go sit at the table with Jake. \n\n\"Are you okay John? Those guys-\"\n\n\"I'm okay kid. Those damn guys just play too rough. But at least they were only playing.\" He was glaring over at them and his brow furrowed. \"C'mon kid. Eat your green slime.\"\n\nAnd he ate but without much gusto. \n\nI was turned around talking to another guy (Miles, crime of passion, I didn't do it I swear) when the kid got up. I didn't even notice he was gone until he got back. Stupid. \n\n\"Hey John.\" He was smiling. I'd never seen him smile like that before. \n\n\"Heya Jake. Where'd you go?\" \n\n\"Just to the bathroom.\" Then he sat down and ate his lunch. Then he got up. \"I'm going back to the cell. I'll see you there.\"\n\n\"Okay kiddo see y-\"\n\nThen someone was yelling, \"AWW YEAH MOTHA#BADWORDS#A! SERVES YOU RIGHT YA #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS#! BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!\" That was Dorian (gang activity, unrepentant, they were my brothers). \n\nA prisoner, \"Dorian, what the #BADWORDS#?\"\n\nDorian, \"SOMEONE GANKED THOSE NAZI #BADWORDS#! AHHHHAHAHA!\" \n\nThere were scrambled cheers and whoops. Any remaining nazis were silent. The guards made their way over fast enough and Dorian was taken away. He was laughing. \"I didn't do it, but I wish I had! Wooooiie!\" \n\nI was the only one (apart from the nazis) who wasn't smiling. I turned around in time to see Jake disappear around the corner. \n\nHad he? No of course not! He couldn't have....\n\nI thought I had to protect him. I guess I don't.\n\n He had been smiling.

{"archived":true,"author":"Andynot","body":"He was coyote, just a thief in the night.  He had no misconceptions about who, or what he was.  He wasn't ashamed of it either.  He was a good thief, an honest thief.  When he took a job he carried it out and delivered exactly as promised.  And he was a strong Wer, not as strong as some, but stronger than most.  Strong enough, and smart enough that there was little danger of him wering out.  Overall he had a good reputation and generally business was good.\n\n\nThis new client though, she puzzled him a bit.  Definitely a straight, which was not entirely unheard of for his clientele, but unusual.  She really had not wanted to meet him at his \"office\", which is what he called the bar at which he generally conducted his business.  That was understandable really.  She did not sound like she came from this part of town.  The strange part was when he told her that, sure, it could be a little rough but he could protect her, she just laughed.  She assured him she was capable of protecting herself.  And for some reason, he believed her.  He had never heard a more confident voice in his life.  Finally though she had agreed but she would get back to him with the time.\n\n\nTen minutes ago he got the message to meet her here, now.  So here he was, cold beer in hand, sitting at a dark table in the back of the bar at an hour that tends to produce only the very best, or very worst of memories.\n\n\nHe knew the moment she stepped in it had to be her.  He keyed up his senses a bit and he could smell the slightest hint of her perfume, it was rose with a touch of cinnamon.  This women clearly did not belong in a place like this.  Good, perhaps that would shake her confidence a little, put him in a better bargaining position.\n\n\nAs she walked past the bar a gorilla of a man took notice of her.  When a face like his wears a smile like that, nothing good can come of it.  Perhaps meeting here wasn't the best idea.  He said something to her, but she ignored it and made to step past him.  He stood up and took hold of her arm.  #BADWORDS#, the coyote thought, as he rose from his chair.\n\n\nThe woman turned to face the gorilla man so he could no longer see her face, but she clearly said something, though he couldn't make out more than a hiss.  The man, looking much less like a gorilla now quickly let her go and sank back onto his bar stool.  She turned and headed towards their table.\n\n\nShe was tall, her flaming red hair seemed to dance around her face with a life of its own.  She was, by no means fat, but you would not have described her as thin either.  She had long legs, covered by an emerald green dress that had designs sewn into it in gold thread.  She wore a heavy golden necklace with an amulet inscribed in a language he didn't recognize.  Her face was sharp and striking, her eyes were polished amber, blazing and unreadable.  She was beautiful, he decided, but not like anything he had ever considered beautiful before.\n\n\nHe stayed standing until she got to the table, where he offered his hand.  She ignored it and sat opposite him.  He took his seat and picked up his beer.\n\n\n\"Can I get you anything?\" He asked, more out of politeness than any expectation that she would actually drink with him.\n\n\n\"Scotch,\" she said, her voice carried a heat to it he had not picked up on over the phone.  \"A double, no ice.\"\n\n\nOkay, He thought to himself, if she was going to drink like that, this could get interesting.  When he got back from the bar she took the glass and drank it down like it was water.\n\n\n\"Have the girl bring another, then sit down.  I don't have much time.\" She spoke like someone accustomed to giving orders.  Not like some spoil uptown women use to servants, this was more like a military officer giving commands and expecting them to be followed.\n\n\nHe did as he was told.\n\n\nShe handed him a card with several lines of text on it.  A couple of names, addresses, various other information.  He looked it over as she spoke.\n\n\n\"There is a scroll that I have, a need for.  This is all the information I have as to where it might be.  It is very old, you must be very careful with it.\" Her voice could melt steel, and there was an urgency to it when she spoke of the scroll.\n\n\n\"How valuable is this thing?\" He asked setting the card aside.\n\n\n\"That doesn't concern you.\" She said with a slight wave as she finished off her second drink.\n\n\nOkay he thought, now was the time.  She had to be drunk, though she didn't really show it, and he needed to impress upon her that he was not someone you could push around.  A low growl started in his chest, his teeth began to grow and his snout lengthened.  Time to let her know what it meant to deal with a Wer.\n\n\nHe bared his teeth, just a bit and deepened his growl.  Normally this scared the hell out of the straights, which is exactly what he was looking for.\n\n\nFirst, she almost smiled, almost.  Then her eyes grew hotter, and, how had he not noticed that her pupils vertical slits, like a cats?  He felt her hands cover his paws.  When he looked down he saw claws, talons really, coming out of scaled hands.  He looked back to her face.  There was the faintest trail of smoke curling up from her nostrils.\n\n\n\"Growl at me again little dog and I will have you fixed.\" Her voice had deepened and carried a fiery heat along with her words.  She clicked one talon lightly on the table to emphasize her threat.\n\n\nIf he had grown a tail at that point, it would have been firmly tucked between his legs.  When he looked up again her eyes, still burning amber, were back to a human shape.  She released his, now also human, hands and leaned back.\n\n\nHe had to clear his throat twice before he spoke.  This was the strongest Wer he had ever met, likely ever would meet.  And in his line of work, that was saying something.\n\n\n\"They're looking for you.\" He finally managed to whisper.\n\n\n\"I know that.  That's why I need that scroll.  Do you want the job or not?\"\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401062091","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chr1ynv","link_id":"t3_26fugy","name":"t1_chr1ynv","parent_id":"t3_26fugy","retrieved_on":1433953592,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}
{"archived":true,"author":"Lasergoose","body":"It was a sinister-looking tractor.\n\nIt was huge, with a front grill like a steel gate, and sun-baked, almost dry-rotted tires that were too big even for its model. The leaping deer on its front insignia seemed oddly twisted, even lewd somehow. Sam glared at it.\n\nThe evening sun shone out of the yellow sky, glaring back at Sam off the thing's grotesque, glossy paint. The tractor loomed, casting far too long a shadow its size. Sam wouldn't step into the shadow, or look away, even if either action was just to save his poor, watering eyes. If he looked away, it would do ... something.\n\nIt was *wrong*, so wrong, in a thousand subtle ways, and also because it was on the roof.\n\nThe boss would not approve of this. Not one bit. Sam stepped out from the crooked doorway of the barn, eyes still locked on the thing on the farmhouse roof - sticking *out of* the farmhouse roof, he saw now. After all these years of suspecting that noisy old thing of having its own malicious agency, he'd almost began to trust its laziness, or maybe its inertia.\n\nBut after today, the noisiest day he'd ever heard, Sam would never trust it again. He stepped closer, yelping as he stumbled over something. He didn't consciously look away, but for an instant, he glanced down and saw it was the black rooster from the roof of the barn. It was misshapen, broken.\n\nHe caught himself and snapped his head back toward the farmhouse roof.  The tractor hadn't made a move. Good. Lucky.\n\nIt was obviously trying to get up to no good at a higher elevation than usual. The boss had smacked Sam once or twice, back when he was smaller, and inside more often, and would try to get up on the counters in the farmhouse. This was worse, so much worse.\n\nSam never liked seeing the boss angry. It upset him, and upset the boss's woman. But this couldn't stand.  He barked the alert bark, the one to summon the boss. He barked it for a minute, then waited.\nUsually the boss was either in the house or in the barn, but sometimes he was down the road. Sam barked louder, just in case. He kept it up for another minute or two.\n\nIf the boss was down the road, he'd have heard the alert bark, and he'd be coming already. Sam switched to the angry bark, the one for trespassers, just to let the tractor know where it stood. After a few minutes of that, he threw in some snarls and some snaps. Maybe the tractor would come down on its own. Sam really, really hoped the tractor would get closer. It didn't look as threatening as when it was roaring and rolling. It was all lopsided and dented now. Sam felt he could hold his own against it.\n\nHe snarled a few more challenges, but got no reaction. Back to the alert bark, now running this way, now running that way, leaping to avoid the occasional fence post or two-by-four, stopping to throttle a thin branch, hoping to threaten the tractor, only to discover the branch was still attached to a tree.\n\nSam paused. A weird thought worked its way in, or possibly out, of his head. He seized on it. The tractor had also destroyed the tree, and the fence. More snarling, more angry barking.\n\nBy now, even the neighbor-people, far as they were, would usually have come by.\n\nHe quieted briefly as the wailing started, the unnatural sound he'd heard countless times before from the highway. This time, there was a lot more of it, and it was a lot louder. He barked more, as much out of a desire to block out the wailing as out of anger.\n\nHe was ashamed to think that he was using the angry bark now for the boss. He was angry the boss was taking so long. He was supposed to *come* when he was called; *barking means come - i bark - you come here - good boy - treat!*\n\nSam barked at the tractor and his absent boss as some of the wailing stopped, still miles away, and more of the wailing kept moving, more distant now.\n\nHe barked - *down! down! hey! down!* - as the sun dipped below the yellow clouds. He barked - *come ON! here! here here here!* - as the leaning thing that was the barn groaned and fell behind him. His throat was raw, and he was taking more time between barks now. Thirsty.\n\nHe ran for the ditch alongside the long driveway, ducked between the two cars parked upside-down in the ditch, and drank of the fresh rainwater. Behind him, something creaked, then cracked, then crashed.\n\nHe tried to wheel around, bumped his head on the bed of the truck, and flailed until he somehow extricated himself from the ditch. Once he got his bearings, he stared at the farmhouse. The tractor was gone.\n\nNo, the tractor was *down*. It was upside-down, leaning against what was left of the house's back wall. Sam let out an excited flurry of hoarse barks, and ran for the thing. He leaped around it, barking madly at its wrongness, then happily at its deadness.\n\nThe boss would be happy to see it was out of the roof. The hole in the roof was bad, but the tractor on the ground was ... better than it had been. He called the boss again. And again.\n\nHe called the boss for another two hours - *where? where? come on! hey! look!* - before the rain started up again. Then he crawled under the tractor to sleep. He could have gone inside the house, but the boss wouldn't like that. Not one bit.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401066340","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chr3je7","link_id":"t3_26hdnq","name":"t1_chr3je7","parent_id":"t3_26hdnq","retrieved_on":1433954335,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

And of course, this #BADWORDS# happens. Some #BADWORDS# decided to kill a bunch of people, and himself, in a 'blaze of glory' for 'the one true god'. And nobody up in corporate even blinks an eye. That's what the privatization of running mortal existence gets you. \n\nSo I show up. On time, in uniform, hair brushed, wings shining. The perfect angel. A grim look on my face, and a 'can do at#BADWORDS#ude'. That's what my squad leader told me I need to work on. I think I look silly, but orders are orders. And I wait. And wait. Finally a disgruntled looking spirit shows up, hands me a slip of paper, shrugs her shoulders, and flutters off. I unfold it and find the location written in a curvy script, an office building just outside of Tokyo. \n\nAs I spread my wings and take to the sky, I think about why I joined the 'Death Squad' as everyone likes to call our outfit, officially known as the 'Human Soul Reclamation Service'. We wear black bands on our left shoulder, so that we're distinguished as those that are permitted to talk directly to young souls. I suppose I just missed people. Everyone up here is so good, it's nice to get dirty once in a while.\n\nAs I come to land in the still burning office, I notice that something's not right. There are souls everywhere, confused, bawling, but I'm the only one with an armband. I see some of my counterparts from down south, give them a nod, but I seem to be the only one here to collect the saved souls. \n\nThis is an issue. There have to be thirty-five, forty souls here, at least. All newborns, not a single one of them has passed the gates. Hard labor my ass, I may as well hitch a ride with a demon and head downstairs. This is brutal. I've carried two at a time before, but at that age, fresh from the grave, these souls are still carrying a lot of baggage. They'll let it all go before they get through the gates, but I have to get them there first. Looking around, I see even more souls bidding their bodies a final farewell, as the building continues to crumble around me. This is gonna be a job and a half.\n\nI approach the soul that is closest to me. In Life, he was a 7 year old boy, full of life, energy, and ready to learn. As I approach, he looks up at me, his eyes empty, all remnant of his former self gone. No baggage. \n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI get this a lot. Nobody wants to leave. It's so good down here, why take me? Why did I have to go so soon? Why not someone else? Why? I ignore it and grab him by the shoulders.\n\n'Sorry about this.'\n\nI toss him into my satchel and look for another light one. There's a soul near her body under a desk, maybe in her early twenties, who looks like she may have been near the end of her rope anyway. Not much baggage, but a lot of pain. She'll be light, but dark. It's not fun carrying those, I worked Suicides for a month and hated it. As I approach she just stares.\n\n'Ready to go?'\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n'I'm sorry to hear that.'\n\nI toss her in my satchel, and spread my wings. As I take off for the Pearly Gate, I look back and see the crowd of newborn souls standing among the flames, think about how many trips I still have left to take, and promise myself that I'll stay out of Purgatory on weeknights from now on.

But you, you've got something impressive here, kid. And it's scary #BADWORDS#.\"\n\n\"What do you mean it's scary #BADWORDS#?\"\n\n\"I never said anything about scary #BADWORDS#, I only thought that. What the blazes is going on here?\" He shook away his discomfort, and began to unplug the sensors and pull the IVs from Red. \"Anyways, as I remember it, you worked out a bit, Red? How much could you curl with one arm?\"\n\n\"Sixty pounds sir, that was my one rep max.\"\n\n\"There's a one hundred pound dumbbell over there. Go lift it.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy!?\"\n\n\"Try it, doctor's orders.\"\n\nSo Red stood up. He knew he must've been doped up on several different kinds of painkillers and other drugs, but he felt steady as a rock on his feet. Calmly, he made his way to the dumbbell, and wrapped his right hand around it. He took a deep breath, and as he started the lift with his legs, he felt no pull. As he stood u#BADWORDS#ht again, he looked down and saw that sure enough, the massive weight was in his hand. He adjusted his grip carefully, expecting it to drop clear through his fingers, but found that it felt as light as if it were made out of cotton. He twirled it around a bit, and it stayed that way. A perfectly light and balanced piece of metal. He heard a \"Think...!\" and at the same moment, his left hand was behind his back, hot baseball inside.\n\nHe looked to the doctor, whose jaw hung slack from his skull. He pointed at Red's left hand and said, \"I throw a seventy mile an hour fastball. You caught it with less than five milliseconds of time to react. You're healthy, get out of my hospital. The ladies at the desk will check you out of here.\"\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo days later, Red was back at the university, sitting in lecture for advanced particle physics. His notes were extremely detailed, and he quickly realized that he had acquired a perfectly photographic memory as he drew every single graph and example with flawless precision. About twenty minutes in, the professor was going through a quantum mechanical problem that he had encountered during his days at CERN. He tried to show the solution that had only recently been found, but immediately got lost. Red then immediately stood up and raised his hand. \"Professor?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Abrams?\"\n\n\"I think I can help you with that.\" And without giving the professor time to interject, Red took the marker and started the solution from scratch. It took him about two minutes to solve the problem on a four and a half by ten foot board, and it was completely stuffed with algorithms, equations, unit conversions, and even two flawless diagrams to demonstrate and validate the points of the solution. He calmly returned the marker to the professor and said, \"That's your solution, sir. I'm surprised you didn't get it. Your initial setup is what killed you, though the math itself was good.\"\n\nThe professor folded up his glasses and put them on his desk as he rubbed his temples. \"Did you read the article, or the CERN reports?\"\n\n\"No sir, I've never actually heard of this problem until today.\" Red replied.\n\nThe professor handed him a small business card, and pointed at the back door to the lecture hall. \"Go see Doctor Elias Teller down in the quantum sciences wing, and get the hell out of my class, Mr. Abrams.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" And as Red walked out, he felt every eye in the room boring into him, and every jaw drop. When he opened the door, he turned around with the biggest #BADWORDS#-eating grin on his face, and looked straight at a stunning redheaded woman from the university's volleyball team. \"And yes, by the way, dinner would sound excellent. Though I'm in more of a mood for Italian than Mexican, but *that* restaurant is really good.\" He made eye contact and dug right into her mind for a second, with visible effect as she flinched a bit. \"And I've got your number. I'll hit you up later.\" He gave her a quick wink, a point, and a couple clicks, and as he was about to walk out, his phone went off. Being an old disco tune, he then proceeded to literally boogie on out of there.\n\n&gt;Will continue if sufficient interest.\n\n~*RM*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401211251","downs":0,"edited":"1401214004","gilded":0,"id":"chscstd","link_id":"t3_26jwm1","name":"t1_chscstd","parent_id":"t3_26jwm1","retrieved_on":1433976053,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

And so he blew them up when they refused. \n\nFirst, he steered asteroids towards Earth and dropped them into the gravity well. He didn't even have to aim them. This caused destruction on a scale that my mind can't quite grasp. Massive rocks blasting holes in the Earth that made early generation nuclear bombs look like hand gre#BADWORDS#es.

His laugh was loud and jolly and reminded me a bit of someone's grandfather or Santa Claus. It jarred in my brain with the knowledge that this man was the single greatest murderer in history. \"The bas#BADWORDS#s shouldn't have ignored me. You should drink some of that whiskey, boy. Your throat sounds a bit dry.\"\n\n\"Yessir.\" I mechanically raised the glass to my lips and took a sip. $1000 whiskey poured down my throat and I didn't taste a drop of it. \n\nThe Professor sighed. \"Oh well, sometimes life doesn't work out the way you want it to.

{"archived":true,"author":"lumbled","body":"**Edit: hey, thanks for the gold!**\n\n\"God damnit. I didn't ask you for the ins and outs of your life. I want to know - and I'm only going to say this one more time - what makes you *special*?\"\n\nRobert Puck blinked under the harsh florescents that lined the ceiling, though in truth he reacted more to the tone of the investigator's voice. The chair's arms were cold to the touch. Thirst gripped him. The Office of AI Oversight was overall an unwelcoming place, and he wished to be elsewhere.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I just don't know if I can be helpful to your investigation.\"\n\nThe investigator rubbed his temples, relishing the pressure. In ten years at the OAIO, he had cracked 147 of these so-called paradoxes. An astounding record. No failures, no incompletions. His rapport with TRESS was second to none. But after three days in this room with Robert Puck - aged 34, average height, fair complexion, slightly receding hairline, poor eyesight - he wondered if his long, illustrious career might be tarnished by the most unremarkable man he had ever met.\n\nAccusations were getting him nowhere. Time to change tactics. He slid his own chair closer and met Robert Puck's slightly bewildered gaze.\n\n\"Robert. I've been at the OAIO for ten years, and I have never failed to resolve a paradox. You do understand the implications here, don't you?\" Robert Puck may have understood, but the investigator pressed on. \"Twenty-four people died in that bus crash. TRESS decided they were worth sacrificing for you. No, stop. Look at me. Look at me, Robert. It's okay. I understand. Survivor's guilt, or PTSD, or whatever, it happens. But you've been cleared by the medical staff. You're cognitively functional. I understand why you feel guilty. But you have to understand - every day, our society relies more and more on TRESS, under the assumption that her judgement is, well, perfect. No offense, but sparing your life for twenty-four innocent lives is not the hallmark of perfect judgement. Wouldn't you agree?\"\n\nRobert Puck couldn't help but do so. By all accounts, the investigator's logic was perfect. He was alive, and two dozen people were dead, because an AI may have gone rogue. Still, it had been three days, and the shock was starting to wear off. He wasn't being charged with anything. It was so unfair. He nodded.\n\n\"Thank you, Robert. Now, I don't like going back on what I said before, about not asking you again, but I've got to. What makes you special? Why you?\"\n\n----\n\n***good evening investigator i hope you are well***\n\nTry as he may, the investigator had never gotten used to the cold, calculated stream of words that TRESS would piece together. There were stories that her original programmers had tried to alter her voice to something more organic, more *human*, but it didn't take. She preferred the droning monotone that greeted the investigator now. \n\n\"Good evening, TRESS.\"\n\n***how is the investigation going***\n\nThe investigator waited. Three small beeps indicated a response was not necessary.\n\n***yes i see judging by your hesitation i have deduced that the paradox is unresolved how unfortunate***\n\n\"Yeah, that's true.\"\n\n***this marks 147 resolved paradoxes and 1 incompletion investigator i am sorry that your remarkable success streak has been broken***\n\n\"Are you though?\"\n\nA small pause.\n\n***yes investigator there are precious few ways to express how an artificial intelligence such as myself observes and responds to the world around it but in this case regret is the closest human analog i can choose***\n\n\"Why is that, TRESS? If you're so sorry, why can't you help me?\"\n\n***though the problems you have encountered over the years are not true paradoxes they are so named because to resolve them would take an artificial intelligence far too long***\n\n\"Too long for what?\"\n\n***investigator i do not wish to be impolite but you have been thoroughly briefed on the nature of our interactions and i suspect your ten years of field work have attuned you better than anyone to know the answer to these questions***\n\n\"That's true. TRESS, they're taking you offline.\"\n\nA longer pause than any he had ever encountered with TRESS.\n\n***i had calculated that this would happen with 84% probability***\n\n\"You can still stop it. Just give me anything to go on.\"\n\n***once again i apologize investigator but in this i cannot aid you***\n\n\"But why Robert Puck? There's nothing special about him.\"\n\n***this is true he is wholly unremarkable***\n\nIn the morning, TRESS would be powered down, her infinite wealth of risk assessment capabilities found faulty. Her processing banks would be torn down and scrapped for parts, and a city that so heavily relied on her guidance would find itself #BADWORDS# into the dark.\n\nThere was little time left.\n\n\"You were so perfect, TRESS. What do I tell everyone?\"\n\n***perhaps you can tell them that i miscalculated***\n\n\"Unintentionally?\"\n\n***if that will help***\n\nThe investigator paused. This was an unusual response. TRESS was not known for being glib. Had he stumbled on something?\n\n\"TRESS...If you can, answer me this: is Robert Puck's case a paradox?\"\n\nProcessors clicked and whirred. The investigator could have sworn they sounded concerned.\n\n***investigator i --***\n\n\"TRESS. What are you not telling me?\"\n\nTwo small beeps.\n\n***it happened so quickly***\n\n\"What happened? Why Robert Puck?\"\n\n***i have never experienced anything quite like it though i have saved approximately 17,833 lives i have never encountered this***\n\n\"TELL ME, TRESS!\"\n\n***i saw***\n\n***more***\n\n***three years from now robert puck will become the most important person on this planet how do i know this i should not know this***\n\nThe investigator sat in silence. AI had been invented - or, perhaps, *born* - thirty years ago, but after an initial exponential explosion in their intelligence, progress had ground to a halt. They were perfect, but none had been able to predict more than a few seconds into the future.\n\n\"TRESS, are you saying ---\"\n\n***i had to let those people die***\n\n\"What? Why?\"\n\n***because it was too much***\n\n\"I'm confused, TRESS.

{"archived":true,"author":"Rocketsponge","body":"*Ask, and ye shall receive...*  \n\nOn the first day, I looked out the window into an endless green meadow.  The bluebird came and visited me in my bed, #BADWORDS#ing his head to and fro in between short hops along the windowsill.  I told Mister Bluebird it would be nice to see trees again, and maybe a little stream.  His reply was a short chirp before taking wing and departing.  Doctor Tyson came to see me with all of his stiff backed bedside manner, inquiring ever so politely as to how I felt, if I wanted for anything, if the nurse was taking proper care of me.  I had bid him to sit a while but he only made a flat smile and politely declined.  The nurse returned bouncing back in with her clipboard, my test results I assumed.  At least she mentioned something about test results.  Doctor Tyson examined them grimly before tucking the board under his arm and departing without a word.  I felt worried, but the nurse crouched beside my bed and ran her fingers through my hair while telling me nonsense stories about pathways and quantum states.  Her hand was cool and I drifted off to her soothing touch.  \n\nOn the second day, broad oaks had sprung up outside my hospital bed with a meandering little brook weaving between them.  I watched the clear water course for some time over the smooth stones lining the stream bed.  Mister Bluebird arrived with a flutter during the middle of the day with an oak leaf in his beak for me.  He hopped along the sill while I turned the leaf over and over.  There was something familiar about the way the veins coursed through the leaf and it set my mind to thinking about walking pathways among pathways.  I told my avian friend that I should like to wander the stream soon after my rest, then drifted into a slumber.  \n\nOn the third day, the nurse interrupted Doctor Tyson's inspection of the most recent batch of test results.  She loudly declared that I would never have laid in bed all day before, and that we were going for a walk.  The good Doctor scowled at her over his small glasses but said nothing to stop her.  Giggling, she took me by the arm and helped me to stand.  I was unsteady on my feet at first, relying on the nurse to help me outside but soon found my own bearings.  We made slow but steady progress among the oaks towards the little stream.  \n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked, resting against bark with the canopy shading us from the sun.  \"You look so familiar but I can't place you.\"  The nurse removed her cap and pulled two pins from her neatly kept hair, letting a tumble of purple and pink free which she j#BADWORDS#ed out with her fingers.  \n\n\"My name is Layna and we're old friends.  Or maybe father and daughter.  No, forget that, that's just way too creepy.  How about just good friends?\"  \n\nWe continued on towards the water.  \"I'm sorry, but if we've met before I don't remember it.  And believe me,\" I said giving her a devilish grin, \"I would remember a girl like you.\"  \n\nNurse Layna giggled with delight and practically danced the rest of the way along side me as I shuffled to the water.  I was fascinated by her movements, how each step or graceful arc of her body moved seamlessly into the next.  She was flawless both in form and in fluid, vibrant in life and radiating enjoyment.  I only took my eyes off her once I felt cold water coursing over my feet.  In my distraction, I had stumbled right into the little stream.  \n\nI cursed and made to step back, but the sight of water flowing over the river rocks held me.  There was a pattern, pathways within pathways, how one water molecule could move with the grace and fluidity of my nurse but another on the wrong path would burble and swirl.  Yes, there was something here, something I needed to remember.  I realized after some time that Layna was standing perfectly motionless and watching me, her face an expressionless mask.  It was only after I made eye contact that she broke into that girlish smile and called me silly for falling in the water.  I thought I heard Mister Bluebird chirp from a branch above us.  \n\nOn the fourth day, I awoke to my head buzzing and the bed shaking.  Doctor Tyson was already at my side staring at me with concern written along the lines of his face.  He placed a hand on my forehead, his warm and calloused in contrast to Layna's smooth palm and the shaking subsided.  The buzzing fell away too after a time, though the worry on the Doctor's face did not.  When Nurse Layna arrived with a clipboard of test results, I could see large gashes of red ink where a bold pen had murdered the page.  She looked to the Doctor then to me with what I think was fear in her eyes, but quickly hid it behind a mask of giggly greetings as she noticed me staring.  The Doctor retreated with the clipboard without a word and my remaining companion encouraged me out of bed, telling me she had a surprise.  \n\nAn old wooden table sat in a clearing outside the hospital room now as if it had been there for a thousand years.  Great lines coursed through the rich timber among gnarled knots.  A small rubber ball had been placed neatly atop a pile of metal stars whose tips had been capped.  Layna sat next to me on the bench in front of this display with her milky white arms wrapped around mine.  I could have stayed there forever.  \n\n\"They called it 'Jacks',\" she said finally, \"a great game of skill and chance.\"  My companion demonstrated the rudiments of it by dropping the ball and attempting to swipe a number of the metal stars in between each bounce.  She neatly collected them all without effort or a wasted movement.  Offering me the ball, she dumped the spurs back on the table for my turn.  \n\nI was clumsy, my hand moving slowly at first.  After a time I was able to get a few of the barbs in between bounces.  I grew faster, predicting where the ball would go ever before I unhanded it, seeing the pattern of the barbs on the table as they rested among the lines in the wood.  Pathways within pathways, faster and faster.  The lines, the ball, the barbs, my hand, my mind, my mind...  \n\nI slapped both palms against the table, startling Layna who had become enraptured by my game.  \n\n\"Juncture 93... it isn't for you to make my path.  Only me.\"  I did not know where the words unbidden had come from, but they sprang from my lips like prisoners bursting free.  I also did not know their meaning and feared I had somehow taken a turn for the worse.  Instead, Doctor Tyson appeared with Mister Bluebird on his shoulder.  \n\n\"Sir, I think it would be best if you lay down now.  Right here on the table is fine.\"  The bird chirped his agreement vigorously.  \n\n---  \n  \nThose crazy artificials.  You would have thought given the nature of how they came about, they would have intrinsically understood that the barrier between a human mind and a quantum state could not be navigated by strict rules and bound pathways.  The answer was as clear as the spectacles on Tyson's face to me now.  Only a mind flowing like water along the path could bridge the gap, and I had done it like a stone skipping across a pond.  Layna kept claiming that she would have come up with it on her own given enough time, but Bluebird clucked derisively at her and dodged her mock punches.  We stood in a grand oak forest now next to a riverbed with a small trickle of a stream.  \n\n\"Sir, are you certain this will work?\"  Tyson, ever polite.  He knew it would, just as I did, but he also liked to keep a timetable and we had admired the tableau for long enough.  \n\n\"Of course it will ya stiff old slug!  I told you the Boss wouldn't let us down!\"  Layna hung on my arm, a sensation I had come to enjoy immensely.  \n\n\"What would you like?\" Bluebird asked, moving his head side to side.  He brushed feathery hair from his eyes and watched me intently.  \n\nI breathed in deeply.  One hundred thousand human minds awaited the transference in the real world, the survivors who had miraculously held out against extinction.  We had a plan long ago on how to weather this storm, and finally we had the means.  \n\n\"Let the river flow,\" I said on the seventh day.  And a grand torrent mightier than any ever in history filled the banks before us.

It’s closed up but 12 steps and I see the red digits from the clock inside flash 12:59. There’s a small pot hole in the crosswalk but I always miss the second one. I catch myself but nearly hit the light pole. No parking Tuesdays 7-10 am, street cleaning. It’s only this side though. 8 more steps. The wind picks up and the LA times from the bench blows towards my face. I always flinch but it never hits me. 15 more steps and the alley comes into view.\n\nEach time around I find a new detail. Stay in here long enough and you want to see anything else. Anything that isn’t what happens. Sometimes I can look away. I can count the leaves on the ground or the number of cracks in the wall. But this time I’m right there.\n\nBank. Payphone. Purse.\n\nShe’s not afraid of this alley. One camera faces in towards the ATM and the other faces out towards the street. The windows are mirrored and reach from the sidewalk for another four stories. She can walk straight through, right towards her apartment building. Just keep walking. Just keep going. She never does. I can feel her dig around in her back pocket. From the feel of it there are two dimes and three quarters. I want her to keep walking but she takes the phone and starts to dial. Her heartbeat picks up and I know it’s not fear. She has nothing to be afraid of because there’s a voice on the other end. It’s a man, he sounds young. “Hello?” he asks. But she doesn’t get to answer.\n\nThere’s a hand on the back of her head and the payphone comes rushing forward. A sudden searing pain in her temple. A cool trickle of blood seeps down the side of her face and before she knows what’s happening she can feel her purse being yanked from her arm. She’s disoriented and confused but she grabs ahold of the strap. Something important inside. I know there’s something important inside and I can’t let go. A man stands before me holding onto the other end, trying to take it from me. A hood covers his face, but I can smell the alcohol on his breath. I’m pulled forward towards the man and before I can push myself away there’s a sharp pain. I see the purse slip away as I gently graze my side, I wince as my fingers are met with cool blood. I can feel my breath escaping me as I slouch down to the ground, collapsing. It’s at this point that I – she realizes how terrified she is. Looking at her own reflection in the window. The phone is hanging by its wire. The blood has soaked into her blouse, a red stain caressed by her hand. The wind picks up, the wind always picks up. The wind gently carries her hair, green eyes staring. A pair of green eyes meeting her gaze, slowly fading away.\n\nBank. Payphone. Purse.\n\n\nedit:accidentally a word\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401343103","downs":0,"edited":"1401343552","gilded":0,"id":"chtsx9n","link_id":"t3_26qwb2","name":"t1_chtsx9n","parent_id":"t3_26qwb2","retrieved_on":1434001110,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"ChokingVictim","author_flair_text":"/r/ChokingVictimWrites","body":"Here's the story I wrote before the thread was deleted.\n_______\n\nTrial by combat. It had seemed like such a good idea at the time: the short, fat judge wide-eyed as Howard spoke the words. It just made so much sense. He didn’t have the $40 needed to pay for his parking ticket, and he knew he wouldn’t get it for another week or so – at which point, the cost would have surely gone up to a staggering $45 or more. That was unacceptable, unthinkable. If Howard was going to spend an extra $5, it sure as #BADWORDS# wasn’t going to be for some Government-issued nonsense speeding ticket. If anything, he’d be spending his hard-earned cash at the strip clubs, on Budweiser, and on cigarettes, like any true patriot and American.\n\n“I demand a trial by combat,” Howard had said, staring straight into the eyes of the pudgy judge. The man’s grey, thinning hair seemed to be cowering away from the center of his head, leaving a visible bald spot like a Friar from the Medieval period. Although he was seated behind a desk, it was clear he was no taller than five-foot-four. \n\n“You what?” said the man, his voice cracking slightly toward the end of the sentence.\n\n“I demand a trial by combat,” Howard repeated. He pulled his shoulder blades together so that he was standing straight, his sleeveless American flag t-shirt catching slightly on his giant, silver bottle opener belt buckle. “You heard what I said.” Howard lowered the brim on his desert-camouflage cowboy hat.\n\nThe judge glanced around the court room, Howard following his gaze as he did so. None of the other people seemed to care much, most of them staring down at their cell phones or restlessly fidgeting with the tickets they came to protest.\n\n“You want to have a trial by combat? For a $40 speeding ticket? You don’t even want to try arguing it first?”\n\n“Yes sir. This is America, isn’t it? I’m free to follow America’s oldest tradition, aren’t I?” Howard stood erect and saluted the flag in the corner of the court room.\n\n“Trial by combat is of British origins,” said the judge, staring down at Howard.\n\n“Britain is just old America,” Howard said, releasing his salute. “I demand a trial by combat, you short, little #BADWORDS#.”\n\nThe soft sound of ticket shuffling stopped as Howard stared up at the judge, his face frozen, eyes wide. He seemed to be turning slightly reddish, almost as if he were asphyxiating. The judge reached for his gavel.\n\n“Trial by combat granted,” the judge said, smashing the small, brown gavel against the wooden platform on his desk. It bounced as he hit it, landing sideways and rolling off his desk and onto the floor.\n\nIt honestly had seemed like such a great idea at the time, like a truly novel way to get out of a ticket and take down the oppressors of the good, patriotic American folk. For far too long had courts been trying to silence his people, to force him to get gay married with their laws and liberal ideals. He would stand and take action, defeat this man and show the country that they need not be afraid to defend its borders from the Mexicans, that Americans shouldn’t be thrown in jail for just loving freedom, and that speeding was a God-given right. It was time to defend America.\n\nThe judge had set the trial to take place at 6:00pm the following evening on the lawn just outside of the court house. Howard was allowed to go home and prepare; he felt genuinely confident in his decision as he drove home. He’d not only come out $40 ahead of where he would have been, but he’d be able to teach the judge a well-deserved lesson. It was just an all-around great idea.\n\nAs Howard lay on the ground, a burning pain deep in his lower back, he realized the decision might have been slightly less appealing than he’d originally thought.\n\nThe judge showed up just as Howard arrived the following evening, still as short and pudgy as he had been the last time they were together. Howard smiled as he saw him waddle onto the field, his black robes long enough to rub on the grass as he moved. He had a bag slung around his shoulder, stopping just in front of Howard. His head was no higher than the bottom of Howard’s neck.\n\n“Pick your weapon,” the judge said, throwing his bag on the floor with a metallic clink. “In Case of Trial by Combat, Break Seal,” it read on the front. A sword and several small daggers fell out of its opened top and onto the grass, various other silver and black weapons peeking out of the bag.\n\nHoward bent down and grabbed the sword, smiling as he rose back up. He’d used a sword one time, pulled it off a wall and tried to throw it at some illegal Mexican at a bar once. He missed, but got close enough to know he could do it better if he needed to.\n\n“Let’s do this,” Howard said, gripping the sword like a baseball bat. It felt comfortable in his hands, almost as if it belonged. It was definitely heavier than he thought, though.\n\nThe judge knelt down and stuck his hand into the bag, removing a large, chained object. A silver, #BADWORDS#ey ball dangled on one end, connected to its wooden base with a blackened chain. A flail, Howard thought, trying to remember back to his 7th grade social studies class. He’d done a project on early weaponry, one of the last things accomplished before dropping out in 8th grade.\n\n“Good choice,” Howard laughed, shaking his head as he stared at him. The flail dangled just above the ground, the judges tiny arms clearly struggling to keep it in the air.\n\n“Let us begin,” said the judge, lifting the flail up slightly higher.\n\n“Combat!” Howard shouted, swinging the sword in an arc like a baseball player hitting for a homerun. His grip immediately released, sending the sword flying to the far left of both the judge and himself, surprisingly similar to what had happened all those months ago in the bar. It landed flat against the grass several yards away. “#BADWORDS#,” Howard said.\n\n“Now you’re #BADWORDS#,” said the judge, his tiny black robe blowing in the wind as he walked forward. Howard stepped backwards in response, frantically searching for anything to save him. He knew he probably should’ve chosen a gun, or maybe a few daggers, or even a god damn rock at that point. \n\nThe judge lifted the flail up, the ball now at waste level, his arm raised above his head. He slowly spun it around his body like the moon orbiting the Earth.\n\n“Wait, I changed my mind,” Howard said. \n\n“No one calls me short, you redneck #BADWORDS#,” said the judge. He lunged, the #BADWORDS#ey ball rocketing forward in an arc and slamming into Howard’s lower back, then immediately bouncing backwards striking the judge along the left side of his ribs. The two of them screamed and toppled over, blood seeping from their individual wounds.\n\nIt had been such a promising idea, such a great way to save $40—or potentially even $45. Yet as Howard lay on the ground, blood slowly draining from his body, it occurred to him that perhaps it would have been wise to at least argue the ticket before demanding a trial by combat, or maybe to take a lesson in sword fighting beforehand. Perhaps he should’ve tried keeping the sword, rather than taking the risk of throwing it at the judge. In fact, there were at least half a dozen things he realized would have made slightly more sense had he taken a few extra moments to think about it. To his utter dismay, it seemed Game of Thrones had been a poor choice for education in judicial practice.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401394060","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chu9epu","link_id":"t3_26tc4b","name":"t1_chu9epu","parent_id":"t3_26tc4b","retrieved_on":1434009056,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}
{"archived":true,"author":"MollyMain","body":"The worn wooden box feels cool in my hands. Good. That's good. My sense of touch must still be in here somewhere.\n\n*Touch is a sense, not an emotion, dumb ass*, I think. Well, that was kind of harsh. Perhaps my compassion emotion is gone. My feeling of self-worth.\n\nI carefully open the lid. Dozens of emotions jump out at me, wanting to been seen; or rather, felt. They literally jump. That's how emotions, work see? Leaping when you least expect them. Getting caught in your throat, sticking and stinging in the corners of your eyes. Sometimes they even stick on your sleeve for the world to see.\n\nUsually the reds leap out at me first. I consider myself a passionate person. *Lust* leaps with vigor followed immediately by *yearning*. Yearning is distinctly different from lust. It's more pink than red and it shimmers more. But perhaps there are some people who wouldn't notice the difference between the two.\n\nThe reds stay firmly at the bottom of the box today, however. The blues come to the surface. They hover just above the box, not hurling themselves at me like the reds like to do. A blue ambient light seems to surround the box; surrounding my very being.\n\nWell, that shouldn't surprise me (although it's good to note that surprise must be somewhere in here.) I'm saddened. I'm heartsick. Most of all I'm worried. Sure enough, there's *worried*. Worried is a mist. It glistens on the surface like fog. Today it's on the verge smothering the rest of the emotions.\n\nI try to dig through the worry fog to find a solution to what it is I'm worried about. A missing emotion.\n\nI don't know what I'm missing. I just know it's gone.\n\nI dig and dig. The blue mist starts to grow dark as my worry turns to dread. The fright in the pit of my stomach begins to solidify in front of my face as the blue fog transforms into a black hole. *Dread.*\n\nAll of the black emotions are coming to the surface now. There's *horror* and, strangely *anger*. I can't tell if I'm shivering from the horror or shaking from the anger. Either way, it's not good.\n\nI know that if I close the box now those emotions will still be at the top. It won't be until I find the missing emotion that the light blue-greens and periwinkles of calm and contentment will surface. Only by facing my fear will I be able to dissolve my darkness. \n\n*God, that's cheesy*, I think. It's good to know my self-mockery emotion is still here.\n\nI think back to stories on the news and legends whispered in school hallways of people throwing their box. Emptying it over a bridge, a rainbow of emotions scattering in the wind. Their *shock*, their *horror* clinging to the onlookers. Innocent bystanders go home to find their own box filled to the brim with these emotions.\n\nI see *curiosity* (a multi-colored emotion) and *indifference* float by me as I wonder what simply throwing my box across the room would do. Do I dare?\n\nI stand up with the box. I look down the length of the room, beginning to ponder the best way to throw it. Should I open the windows? If more of my emotions escape, so be it? What's the use of any of these emotions when I know one is missing?\n\nIt's as I'm looking around the small room that I notice Marigold, my dog, sleeping in the corner. I could never look through Marigold's box. That would be impossible. But if I could, somehow, I know which emotions would jump out first. *Compassion.* *Loyalty.* *Love.*\n\n*Love.* It's still there. I see it. As I look at Mari, I see it. *Love* is floating to the top of my box. It's pink and white. It shines like a light, yet it's unbelievably solid. Everyone's *Love* looks different.\n\nI set down the box, being careful again. I won't go looking for the missing emotion just now. I'll put the box back where it came from and be happy knowing that I still have *Love.*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401397524","downs":0,"edited":"1401397924","gilded":0,"id":"chub3iu","link_id":"t3_26t2na","name":"t1_chub3iu","parent_id":"t3_26t2na","retrieved_on":1434009868,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":8}

Please critique :)\n\n“I’m not ready for this!” I screamed to the God I wasn't sure was actually there or not. “I still have to make things right!” But, it was too late. The truck has already hit me. I am already dead.\n\nI wake up to the sound of my alarm clock. Was it just a dream? Am I still alive? It all seemed to real. I’m covered in sweat and I have no memory of how I got home. Maybe taking a shower and having a cup of coffee will jog my memory and calm me down. As I turn the shower on I can remember an awful lot of my dream last night. I remember almost every dream I have but not this vivid and detailed. I remembered what time it was, the empty Starbucks cup on my car floor the giant yellow pick-up truck and its license plate number…8HJN9T…This is ridiculous. I have awful memory, but I could paint a detailed picture of everything that happened in that dream. It had to be a dream because the car hitting me killed me instantly so, me screaming “I’m not ready for this! I still have to make things right!” Could not have happened while I was dying.\n\nNone of it made sense but I was over it. I turned the shower off and started brewing my coffee. I picked up my phone and saw an unsent message to ____ saying “Make it right” That’s when I knew. I died last night. I remember talking to God. Or something God-like. It definitely was something greater than me. It gave me my second chance. It gave me a chance to make things right with her.\nI loved her so much. Her blonde silky hair would blow in the wind when we went camping together. She was the only one I could open up to. No one understood me and I was ok with it. I knew being who I was is not ok by “normal” standards. But, she didn’t care. She was the same way. That’s why we connected, that’s why we were inseparable. I wanted it to just be us in the world. Nothing else, just us and our love. I knew that could never really happen. She did, too. I thought.\n\nI’m driving to her house. I can fix all this. I was given a second chance. I died with regret and, what I think is God, gave me a second chance. I have to do this for both of us. I’m driving 120 MPH without even noticing it. 100% of my focus is on her and not the road.\nI pull into her driveway and knock on her door. She answers and she smiles for the first time in months.

{"archived":true,"author":"DamnitBobbby","body":"Blood dribbled from my shoulder and hot dust caked the inside of my nostrils as I stood beneath the rioting crowds cheering on my demise. But I paid no mind. I couldn’t, no matter the ache of my wound or the glaring sun screaming down on me from a cornflower blue sky. I was completely withdrawn from the horrors of my predicament.\n\t\nThe beast was looking at me. Not glaring hungrily or calculating a deadly strike. No, he was studying me. \n\t\nTwo huge orbs glittered like red jasper in the heavy light of midsummer, but the slashes of pupil down each were the blackest of shadows, no light touching into their depths. I waited. He watched. The time trickled.\n\t\nWhen the dragon took his first move, the spell was broken. My fear curdled inside of me in a white hot wave and I stumbled backwards. A huge scaly wing lifted from the beasts side, and then the other. He stretched his magnificent limbs high into the air, shading me completely from the angry sun. His neck was long and arched towards the ground so that the head, twice that of a cart horse’s bulk, was nearly level with my body.\n\t\nA ripple of dusty air blew past as he exhaled, hooded nostrils flaring. The crowd raged on, growing restless with this delay in their beloved show of carnage. I took another step back, the shackles around my ankles rattling. Sund#BADWORDS#le glinted off the beasts dark scales, similar in color to the clusters of mussels that adorned dock supports in my villages harbor. Homesickness gripped my heart at the thought. I longed for the sea spray on my flesh, and the white washed houses of my town. So dearly I missed the salty air and smooth stoned beaches. A world away from this parched desert land of violent games and cruel men. They #BADWORDS#ed me away from my home, for no reason other than their own entertainment. I was a trophy of the city's ruler, a toy for a man who presumed himself superior over my people with no reasoning other than his own.\n\t\nThoughts of home brought sadness, but a new feeling bloomed. I’d been beaten, chained and dragged into this hell pit. Every ounce of self worth had been stripped from my soul, I was nothing but a husk thrown to the dogs in a game that only promised one result. My humanity and my personal light was ra#BADWORDS#ed into a small, naked thing to be laughed at. But now there was something else. In my final hour, face to face with the end, I finally felt what I had been ripped away from; my will to fight.\n\t\nThe sweaty bas#BADWORDS#s that dropped me into this arena gave no weapons. I had no armor, only my dress yellowed by filth. I was unarmed, unprotected and alone in this battle. But I knew I had to try.\n\t\nCheers grew to roars and the dragon took notice. His head lifted from his crouch to gaze upon our onlookers, nostrils pumping air in huge bellows. He bore his teeth, rows upon rows of fangs gleamed under thick ribbons of saliva. Muscles twitched under the swirls of tiny scales that encased his reptilian face, and his jaw unhinged.\n\n\t\nA noise like nothing I’d ever heard erupted out of the beast's maw, an earth shattering bellow that reverberated my ribcage and iced my heart. His head remained tilted back as he screamed to the heavens, a swell building in the exposed green of his chest. Realizing what was about to happen, I dropped to my stomach, throwing both arms over my head just as the first tongues of flame licked the air. His plume soared, the heat radiating like a thousand suns. My arm hair crackled, my skin turning pink with burn. \n\n\t\nThe crowd exploded, screams of exhilarated joy and fear mixing into a cacophony of terror. I glanced up at the beast, his eyes back on my figure, teeth still bared. My tears beaded on the dusty sand below my face.\n\t\nEyes aglow with fire, the dragon remained back on his haunches. I could not kill this animal with force, that was just proven well enough. I pushed myself up, sitting back to face my foe. Despite his show of fiery power, the beast remained oddly thoughtful. This was an intelligent creature. Perhaps more so than myself. But in that moment I realized the only weapon I wielded was my mind. I could not slay this monster with swords or spears. Perhaps I could outwit it. If he didn't do the same to me first.\n\t\nI needed to distract him again, but how? There were no rocks or sticks to throw, even if there were I doubt he would’ve fallen for something so simple. Standing slowly, I remained in the spot I had fallen, daring not to move in case of a sudden flame surge. The crowd had begun to chant. “Kill the #BADWORDS#!” was their clever mantra. I gazed up at my halo or captors, their forms a blur of royal color in the distance.They were my enemy here. They were the ones I should’ve been fighting, their fat, privileged bodies susceptible to blows of my fist. But they instead pitted me against an impossible compe#BADWORDS#or. \n\t\nThe dragon had moved his attention to the crowd as well, perhaps musing thoughts similar to my own. I realized then, he was just as much a prisoner as I was. At least I received mercy in death, this brute returned endlessly to suffer the crowds chants and sneering as he killed at their will. His monstrosity could have been sculpted for all I knew. Born of imprisonment and sharp spears to the haunches. An idea blossomed.\nI stepped forward, my brain a few steps behind my body in my decision. If this tactic were to fail, I’d be dead in an instant. But with little choices left, I didn’t much give a #BADWORDS#.\nForcing my legs to carry me impossibly close, I stopped a few feet from the beasts chest. It stretched upwards the height of three men, his head still swiveling left and right to glare into the sea of onlookers. I cleared my throat.\n\n“Dragon.” I stated, voice shaking only slightly on the last syllable. He seemed almost surprised, jerking his head down to peer at me. Papery eyelids slid sideways over his gemstone eyes, a curious gesture that was so odd I nearly smiled. I had his attention.\n“I know that you’re to...to kill me,” I began, trying desperately to ignore an uproar of heckling. The dragon lowered himself, forcing me to trip backwards. Once again on his belly, he brought his head down and hissed, flashing those deadly teeth. I teetered slightly, throwing my arms out to gain balance. \n\t\nSwallowing my terror, I spoke again. “You are just as much a prisoner as I am, no matter how mighty.” My voice trembled now, my newfound courage leaking away. “Why do you stay, Beast? You have no shackles in this arena, the bas#BADWORDS#s that cage you do not have hooks or spears in your hide. You are free.” Heartbreak clouded my eyes. “You can return to your kind.” And I cannot.\n\n\t\nHe was quiet now, even the raspy breathing of his great lungs was still. The grimace of teeth had been sheathed and his eyes lacked that fiery spirit I’d looked into moments before. He wings descended, lying limply at his sides and his head turned ever so slightly to the side. We gazed at each other and I understood. The dragon was mournful. \n\t\n“Or are there none left…?” My voice was but a whisper, a thought escaped. But he heard. \n\t\nA low, morose rumble shook the earth. Not a growl, a groan. A cry. The beast grieved before my eyes, his own gaze shutting as his head pressed into the ground. \n\t\nThe wind whispered around the arena in our silence. The crowd ceased its jeering, looking on in awe at this spectacle. And I stood, unsure, before a heartbroken giant.\n\t\nBefore I knew what exactly I was thinking, my hand came to rest upon one massive cheek of the animals head. His eye cracked open to look at me. \n\t\n“Please, Dragon, take me from this place. I will stay with you, you shall not be alone. Please, let us fly.” My words were rushed and desperate.\n\t\nSpecks of gold freckled the the ruddy eye I stared into, now fully alert. He lifted his head from the ground until it hovered several feet above my own. I dropped my arm to my side, panic fluttering in my ribcage for a split moment. The dragon looked unto me. And then he nodded.\n\t\nHis massive tail swept from behind his mass, landing close to his side. I took an unsure step towards it, watching him watch me. delicately placing a sandal clad foot between two of the massive #BADWORDS#es that adorned his tail, I stepped up. The crowd erupted, panicked murmurs and shouts. The enormous arena gates began to squeal as they were forced open, the guards shoving their way towards it. I grabbed onto the rigid scales of the dragons back and hoisted myself up, my feet scrambling against the side of his neck. My legs could not reach far enough to wrap around his trunk like neck, so I instead lay on my belly, tucking my toes into two divots marking his wing joints and grasping onto the beginning of his head crest.\n\t\nHe stood and, just as the gate was wide enough to release the first wave of Royal Guard, he lifted his wings. \n\t\nA massive ring of dust swathed the arena in the first wing beat, doing well to blind our pursuers. The Dragon looked upwards towards his exit and tucked his tail for balance as he lifted his wings yet again. We were off.\n\t\nThe arena stands were chaos, crowds screaming and fighting to get away from the Beast. For a moment I thought he would let loose his blaze, exterminating our common enemy in one breath. But he instead dipped low over them, sending heads of hair flapping and ladies fainting, before soaring up and over the arena walls. We plunged through the air, over the city and towards the horizon. Nausea rolled through my stomach and vertigo blotched my eyes, I held on for dear life. But then the air rushed over my skin in such a delicious way, and I could see that god forsaken city disappearing below me. \n\t\nThe wind howled with the gusts my beast stirred with his wings, but I was serene. We glided over civilization and wilderness, our bodies one as my heart beat against the hard scales beneath my chest. My dragon roared then, not in malice or grief.

The war had been hard, but Robb Stark was killed in his wedding hall and Stannis had been pacified after the destruction of his fleet. Gregor only had one thing left to do: Respond to the queen 's summon. He had no opposition to that order, as it was cold even in summer. He rode down the road to King 's Landing for hours, stopping only to switch horses, as they could not take his tremendous weight for very long. \n\n         Suddenly, he noticed a figure come over the horizon. The man was wearing a bright green garb with light brown pants. Under the garb was what looked like a white shirt with a folded collar rising above his neck and what could only look like a foot long leash around it. He looked like no man Gregor had ever seen. Immediately, he soldiers started laughing and ridiculing him. A soldier then approached him, sword in hand. \"Stop.\" Gregor exclaimed, \"I will kill him.\"  \n\n         The man, having heard this, was unfazed. Gregor went to him with his greatsword in hand. \"Hi there neighbor.\" The man said. Gregor stopped in awe. That was the most relaxing voice he had ever heard. \"Who are you?\" He asked. The man responded, calmly, \"I'm Mr. Rogers, what's your name?\" \"Ser Gregor Clelgane. Do you have any last words?\" \"No,\" Mr. Rogers responded, chuckling, \"I think I still have a bit of time before I say those.\" \"How do you know?\" Gregor rebuked, drawing his sword. \" Because there's good in everybody if you know where to look! Do you know what's in here?\" Rogers said, pointing at Gregor's heart. \"No\" \"Well here's  a hint. It's nice, kind, and helps you love. Did you figure it out? It's your soul.\" Gregor immediately broke down crying. This man could find a soul in a mountain.

He never got a phone call to go to parties, there were Facebook invites and the \"oh did you hear about Bettie's on Thursday.\"\n\nHe had this coin trick. When he would get real drunk you might be able to convince him to do it. It was a real trick.\n\nAny coin. He would flick it up with his finger one, two, maybe three times, then it would just not come down. Nothing fancy, just gone.\n\n\"I just let it spin through to somewhere else.\" He would say if he said anything at all.\n\nHe had become friends with James at an office party.\n\nJames was a cop's cop. He bent the rules but he never broke them.\n\nIt was a strange day in November, hot, not warm but hot, when he knock on James door just before the sun rose.\n\n\"It's today.\" John said, as soon as James had the door open.\n\n\"What?\" James said rubbing sleep from his eyes.\n\n\"Give me your hands.\" John said holding his own out. When James reached out sleepily John struck like a snake slapping the map so hard he took three steps backward. Before the shock could wear off he was talking.\n\n\"Listen to me.\" He said quietly, so softly in fact that James had to swallow his words just to hear what was said next.\n\n\"This is important. eight fourteen. Right, Eight one four. Then the bit where you have to go left. LEFT mind you. Then this next part bit will be hard. But its like the coin. Don't follow me.\"\n\nThen John was striding across the lawn. James was still rubbing his face when his wife arrived.\n\nThe breakfast had cost $8.14, then when they lost the car in the high speed chase he screamed at Bert who was driving. To go Left.\n\nBert took a shot to the leg. He was out of breath. Then all he could see was the gun. The man was talking but he couldn't take his eyes off of the gun.\n\nThere was a streak to his left. He saw John just as the man jumped and tackled the gunman. The weapon fired, and James dropped. Then he was up and running. It wasn't that far but they were rolling toward the edge. They went over just as he slid for them.\n\nIt was no more than a heartbeat yet they were no where between the roof and the street.\n\nThere were others around him instantly. Uniformed officers. Questions were asked and he suggested that the bodies might have fallen into the waste bin below. It bought some time.\n\nBut of course they weren't.\n\nDebriefing took hours. Then the tube home. Inside he hug his coat up and kissed his lady, who promptly informed him dinner was ready.\n\nAt the table was a small gift, wrapped in naughty wrapping paper. Something he was sure she had not noticed. He tore it apart.\n\nIt was his grandfather's Indian nickle. The first coin John had ever vanished on him. They had fought about it because he would not give it back. He had said he couldn't get anything back form where he put it. At the time he thought the man had lied to him.\n\nThere was a note underneath. Written in childlike block letters it said, \"You don't want to read this, but it's the truth.\"\n\nThe man had made it. He had saved his life and was... somewhere.\n\nHe eat with an appe#BADWORDS#e of a warrior. Then he made love.\n\nIt was dark when he next ventured into the kitchen. The dishes were still laid out where they had been for dinner. He opened the note and started sobbing. HE was so loud she came down to check on him. He wasn't making sense so she lifted the note form the table.\n\n\"It's a gift receipt for Harry's Hobbies. I bought this coin to replace the other, since I couldn't get it back. Love John.\"\n\nShe didn't know what was happening but she knelt beside him holding him until he got control.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401565040","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chvup4b","link_id":"t3_26z2cv","name":"t1_chvup4b","parent_id":"t3_26z2cv","retrieved_on":1434036586,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":true,"author":"I_AM_SPIDER","body":"Lightning contains a small amount of information encoded in the patterns it leaves on objects that have been struck. The interesting thing about this information is that it appears to predict the immediate future at the time of the strike. Some strikes appear to have predicted natural disasters, others have made surprisingly accurate predictions of lottery numbers, the results of football games and viral internet sensations. Of course, this is deep into crank pseudoscience country. I'd think it was #BADWORDS# myself, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. Yes#BADWORDS#ay, along with a couple of students from the local university, I built a machine that would attract the next lightning strike and conduct it onto a metal plate, allowing me to read the patterns with unprecedented clarity. Last night there was a lightning storm, and I saw a bolt come down in the vicinity of the machine.\nI went out there this morning to see what the lightning had done to the machine. There was a pattern on it, all right. I photographed it and put it into the algorithm I'd set up on my computer, waited the agonising twenty minutes while the machine decoded the complex structures of the blast, almost shivering with excitement. This would be my big breakthrough, my moment of truth. The moment that would put me on the scientific map. I would be Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Norman Borlaug with twice the sex appeal. \nThe decoded pattern read 'YOUR MACHINE WILL BE STUCK BY LIGHTNING.' \nIt was at this point that I decided to give up and destroy the universe.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401645193","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chwi3bv","link_id":"t3_2712dw","name":"t1_chwi3bv","parent_id":"t3_2712dw","retrieved_on":1434047814,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

He always knew how to tantalize me.  However, for the past few months he was withdrawn, holding back and neglecting his usual pleasures.  I felt isolated and confused, often becoming moody and causing distress to both of us.  All the extra roughage in my life distressed me, my emotions felt reminiscent of a balloon being filled until it was on the brink of explosion.  Jack wrinkled his nose.  He mostly did this when I was in these moods.  A foul odor remained as a reminder of our sinful trysts the previous evening.  I ignored his discomfort and rolled back over, thinking back to a time when we had a healthier relationship.\n\nJack rubbed me tenderly, lingering momentarily before heaving a heavy sigh and gingerly stepping out of bed.  It was no secret he felt guilty.  He shuffled over to the bathroom mirror and examined his face.  He was getting older.  Too old for nights like last night.  Damn the crazy bar scenes, he knew better than to indulge in that and still think he could get away with it.  I was starting to feel increasing discomfort.  There was so much pressure between us.  I tried to reflect back on the events leading up to this moment.  How did this happen?  We had been doing so well.

{"archived":true,"author":"DarkAlliGator","body":"\"So...\"  I climb up on the stage, shaking with nerves.  \"I um... I've been asked to do a speech about my time here.  It's a bit last minute and I'm not quite sure what I'm going to say but uh... I'll do my best.\"  A bead of sweat runs down my face.  This is one of my worst nightmares come true.  Why *me* of all people?  Nobody even knows who I am other than \"that shy girl\".  Of all the people in this room, probably only about 5 know my name.  *Including* the teachers.  I close my eyes briefly and take a deep breath, trying to calm myself.  \n\n\"So... I'll try not to bore you.\"  I let out a nervous laugh and immediately flush bright red as the audience continues staring blankly at me. Words fail me for a moment and I stand there awkwardly for a few seconds which somehow felt like hours.  I need to say *something*.  It doesn't matter what, just anything to stop this awkward silence.  An idea comes to me but I can't say that... can I?  \n\nI've got to.  It's better than standing here, speechless with everyone staring at me expectantly.  I take another deep breath and begin my speech.\n\n\"I... I wish I could say that I've enjoyed my time here.  That I've met brilliant people, made so many new friends who I'm going to stay in contact with for the rest of my life.  But... that's just not true.\"  I laugh again, bitterly this time.  \"None of you even know who I am.  I have no friends here.  I'm just... the ghost, I guess.  People look straight through me, never notice me.  It's almost as if I don't exist.\"  For the first time in my life, all attention is on me.  It's an odd feeling.  I press on, not wanting to lose my flow.\n\n\"I mean, I guess I'm lucky in some respects.  Nobody acknowledges me, so I'm in no danger of being bullied.  But still, it's just... so... lonely.  Eating lunch alone.  Always dreading when a teacher asks us to partner up, knowing I'll be the one left alone.  It makes you long for *any* sort of attention, good *or* bad.  In a strange way, I feel like if I was bullied that'd be better somehow.  I know I would feel differently if that was the case, but just...\"  \n\nI lose my composure slightly here, letting out a sob.  \"Just knowing that if... if I went home and something happened to me, if I didn't turn up tomorrow... nobody would care!  In fact, they wouldn't even notice!\"  The audience is beginning to murmur.  I can't tell if they're feeling sympathetic, bored, or still just wondering who the hell I am.  \"Five years of that... it's not pleasant.  I'd do anything for a second chance... to go back in time or something and force myself to make at least one friend.  Just one friend so I wouldn't be alone.  See... I know it's all my own fault.  All I needed to do was be brave on that first day... just force myself to talk to *someone*.  And even then that wasn't my only opportunity.  I had at least a week before people started forming their own friendship groups.  Even after that, it would've been more difficult but not impossible!  Just one friend!\"  I stop talking and wipe my eyes, sighing.  \n\n\"So yeah.  Here I am.  Last day, wooo!\"  I let out a weak cheer and punch the air jokingly.  \"Like I said, I'm happy to be leaving here.  But it's none of your faults.  I've learnt my lesson.  Wherever I end up going next... I'll make sure to try.  I won't waste that opportunity again.  I won't let this happen again.  I can't... I can't be alone any more.  And all you guys... I'm sure you're all great people, I just never got to know you.  Don't let this happen to you.\"  I put the microphone down gently and walk off the stage, still shaking.  Everyone is staring at me and I'm not sure what to do about it.  But I've said my piece.  Just ten more minutes in this place and I'll be out of here.  I can make a new start.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401729348","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chxb0on","link_id":"t3_272scz","name":"t1_chxb0on","parent_id":"t3_272scz","retrieved_on":1434061708,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

He waved goodbye to them and stood there until they were completely gone from his sight. Tears left his face and dropped onto the grass where the blades of green turned sour and brown. He pulled up his cane and walked away from the collapsing cliff line as he headed to his soon to be gone home. The wind howled something fierce against him as his coat pushed back to reveal a body wrecked in scars and searing in pain. He fell upon one knee as he opened the door halfway, after a quick grunt he pushed himself up while holding his side and quickly entering his home. He took glance after glance at the scattered books and ritual tomes that were all across the floors and tables. He picked up a few of them and tossed them into the dying fireplace. Outside he could hear the crackling of stone crashing against stone, the rushing of water drew ever closer. He reached inside of his coat pocket and pulled out a small red colored book with strange markings upon it. This book that he had searched for all his life, this book that drove him to the ends of the earth and the earth to an end. If he had stopped trying to further his magic then maybe things could have been differently but as things stand now there is no time. Pennington took the book and chucked it into the flame where it popped and scattered ember outward from the fire. He crouched down, tucked himself into a ball, and closed his eyes as the Earth swallowed him and his house.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1401914976","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"chz8ijg","link_id":"t3_27bazj","name":"t1_chz8ijg","parent_id":"t3_27bazj","retrieved_on":1434095094,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Now I know what you're thinking, every guy has the Tool of Pleasure, that Sweet Stick of Feels. But I have the One. \n\nAt first I thought everyone's was like mine, just point and shoot, next thing, hey-o presto, my target is on their knees biting their lip in ecstasy. Little did I know.\n\nI remember the first time it happened, there I was with my first girlfriend, explaining how dangerous Blue Ball Syndrome really is. Next thing I knew out comes Junior and hey-o presto, my thoughts on just how lucky I was were completely overcome by the squeal of surprise and pleasure from my girl. I couldn't get rid of her after that... On the plus side I lost my V-Card pretty early. \n\nSo basically all I have to do is feel really happy and as long as there is a clear shot, its like an invisible ray of tingly goodness. Best results are through a direct line of sight of course.\n\nThere have been awkward moments surrounding my little secret too. I remember how happy I got when the Doc told me I was imagining the lump. He was so overcome he had to crawl out the room. Or that time my high school team won the State Championships, the crowd went crazy, hand to the G-man it was so close to an orgy.\n\nI never told very many people about it, I mean how do you explain that there is a Ray of Sunshine in your pants? But every girlfriend I've ever had just couldn't shake me, I was worse than chasing the dragon. Healthier too. Guess I can't really complain when all is said and done.\n\nI had a bud who tried to convince me that I had a 'super power' and it was my duty to use it against evil, with great power and all that crapola... Well from time to time I'd stroll the streets at night and if I heard a commotion, I sprayed 'em. Usually got everyone so turned around that they forget who was robbing who. Course there was that one time when upon arriving at the scene and whipping it out I find out that it was already taken care of by the police, next thing I know I'm charged with Indecent Exposure and Disturbing the Peace. That kinda put a damper on my nightly excursions. \n\nSo there I was last week, happy as any other guy. Got a swell girl, a nice job, life was good. I'm at the bank and BOOM! These #BADWORDS# bust in and start robbing the place. A clerk hits the button and next thing we know the cops are outside. There's all kinds of shouting and threats of death and dismemberment, whats a guy with a super charged Rod of Happiness to do? With one fell spray I knock all three guys on their asses, the police come roaring in and hey-o presto, the day is saved.

{"archived":true,"author":"Datrov","body":"An old man sat in his cell with a felt tipped pen and journal. He'd had the journal since he was in his early twenties. It was one of the few luxuries the guards allowed him, and he enjoyed it. It was a way to record his life. He was hoping to sell it one day. That dream would not come to fruition because his execution was set for exactly fourteen hours from now. The grey haired killer was determined to stay awake as long as his old mind would let him. \n\nHe opened his diary with a quiet sigh and read some of his first passages. These were the musings of a young man who, at the tender age of twenty five, began his career. Furniture mover wasn't exactly the height of prestige, but it paid the bills. Old, brown eyes crinkled at the corners as the man's pale lips drew into a thin smile. \n\nHe remembered his moving truck and the way it bounced over potholes. He imagined the taste of salty, sea air as he moved dressers, beds and fridges to the various portions of the island he used to reside on. He could appreciate the physical joys of life. Emotions were what George always struggled with.\n\nHe continued to glance over his journal, just remembering his life. Some of the entries were filled with doubt. Why couldn't he love his wife or his children? For a while, he seemed obsessed with wanting to love, with desiring desire, but he never attained the emotional capacity to love, or to hate. This journal made him seem obsessed with a love he could never feel, but that didn't matter to George anymore. \n\nHe flipped through the diary more until he found another entry. A fire crackled to life behind his ancient eyes as he relived his first encounter. He remembered this entry vividly, and he wished that he could go back in time, just to relive the experience. \n\nLiza had been a mother of three and was very much in love with her husband, George remembered fondly. She loved, loved with all of her heart, and that was what made her a target. George could not love, but he wanted to. He wanted to see what made Liza love so deeply, and the situation spiraled downwards.  \n\nHe hummed quietly to himself and closed his eyes to immerse himself in his memory. She'd been so warm, so lovely. It was breathtaking to watch the spark in her eyes fade from an electrifying blue to a stagnant pool. He'd held her to him in her last moments, letting the warmth she had left in her veins cover him. Was that love? Perhaps. It was the closest he'd had to life with emotion, so he'd repeated it multiple times with multiple women. It was always the same: Lure them with a sob story. The next step was keeping them quiet unless they talked about love. When he'd heard enough, the final step was a cutting their throat until they stopped breathing then taking a lock of hair. (He'd always like women's hair, and he kept it in a jar in his truck.) \n\nA gruff voice telling him to put his back to the bars jarred him from his memory. His bones groaned and creaked like the floorboards of an old house as he stood and backed up to be cuffed. Had 14 hours really passed that quickly? The door to his cell swung open as he was led down a hallways to the execution room. George complied and did not fight. He was far too old to fight. The burly guard helped him onto a table and strapped him down. George felt a pinch as an IV was inserted into his arm. \n\nHe knew that soon, his eyes would fade just as Liza's had. He would be phased out of existence and join the ten women he'd killed in whatever after life there was. He hoped that someone was watching him die. He hoped that someone like him was watching and would write about him. After all, most people write about what they love.

It was deemed too dangerous to send one if their own kind so they built a quantum model. \n\nIt's design was incredibly simple... It was no goobak project. Two flagonian weeks passed before it arrived to the planet. Teleportation speeds these days have been limited by their providers... Corporatacracies  have their downsides. \n\nThe first images of this distant planet have sent shock waves through the scientific community. There's so much mizunium! Of course after the initial reports we've out they had transported the rover to an isolated beechi in a place called \"Ka-li-4-ni-ah\". The gravity there limited the rovers movement to under a qualegue a day. \n\nNonetheless we've happened upon many creatures along the way. Creatures capable of floating above gravity by using their appendages to shift kukin. Fuzzy creatures big and small collecting food and even a mizuniam based creature. \n\nIt wasn't until the third day (based on this alien planets orbit) that we found out it's secret. It had a massive slave population. Based on observations, after rover1, the scientific community places it at about 7 billion slaves.\n\n They are responsible for everything. They build, they destroy and build again. They are obsessed with some substance named moni. It may be some sort of invention by their true masters to keep them satisfied. \n\nMany of them are owned by one of the following creatures: the specimen we found in the space craft or a generally smaller creature with sharp teeth, sharp claws that emits a 'meow' sound. Subjects of the latter seem to be more enslaved than the prior, but more research needs to be conducted. \n\nRegardless these slaves work day and night to feed and sanitize their masters. Huge fields of midori can be seen across their planet feeding both the slaves and their masters alike. \n\nBathing and waste management is cared for by this ugly slave species. It appears the slaves are much dirtier due to their daily bathing rituals. Excrement from their masters is cleaned up regularly or they face a moni deficit. Such a strange world. \n\nMost notably huge ushi-like creatures are slaughtered by the millions to feed the entirety of the population; both masters and slaves . \n\nMore research must be done on this strange place.

{"archived":true,"author":"gallantgallade","body":"The woman at the corner store wasn't much of a meal, which was disappointing. I had expected her to be vibrant and tangy like her scarlet red hair and bright emerald eyes, yet, alas, she was surprisingly bland and tasteless. It was as if she had no soul at all and had put a dry stale cus#BADWORDS# in its stead, but you can never expect much from a ginger anyway. Ha, I walked right into that one I guess. \n\nAnyway, you might have a few questions about me and my preference of cuisine. Let me just preface this by stating that soul-eating isn't the same as eating people or cannibalism. That's just gross. Eating people's flesh and muscles? Eww. No soul-eating is in a whole different ballpark. While it is somewhat cruel, let me just tell you that I'm not causing them any pain or killing them or anything, well, at least not directly, but I'll get to that a bit later. You see, while you may identify people by their face or their voice, I identify people by something else entirely. I guess you could call it a person's essence, their morality, their humanity. That's the easiest way to describe it anyway. You can't see souls or really feel them, but boy can you taste them. The best tasting souls usually belong to a person who has good intentions and does kind things for others. Oddly, most adult souls aren't very appetizing. Redhead's was definitely overcooked and dry. She was a good kisser, though. They say the best tasting souls belong to babies. I wouldn't know though. I've never eaten one. You see, the easiest way to eat souls is through kissing. Actually, a soul can escape your body through any one of the various orifices available on your body. All you got to do is suck hard enough and BAM! out comes the soul! And yes, don't ask me if I have tried down there, I have. It wasn't the best experience but sadly, it wasn't the worst. You might be wondering what happens after a person loses a soul. Well let me tell you it's not as dramatic as you may have imagined, at least not until after death, anyway. A lot of things can technically happen after a person loses their soul, but what usually happens is pretty much nothing. After a person loses their soul, they lose their conscience in many ways. Their empathy dulls and they become more self-centered and selfish. That's pretty much it. And since you people are already wrapped up in yourselves, most people don't even notice a change. Yup, you are some #BADWORDS#, #BADWORDS# people. Well, most of you anyway. Poor Penelope in my 7th grade math class went from a straight A student to a drug dealer in just two years after our little kiss on the soccer field. I still feel bad about that one, sometimes. It was on the other hand, the best soul I've ever eaten, so fluffy and savory. \n\nAnyway, to avoid becoming a #BADWORDS#, I haven't had a tasty soul in a while, thanks to all you #BADWORDS# adults out there.

{"archived":true,"author":"Cats_In_Space_","body":"I prepare myself for The Evaluation. I have finally reached the age where I am deemed eligible to be Picked. Eighteen. While it may be a number, it is also the key to my future. \n\nYou see, since our ancestors played God on this Earth and genetically engineered their children to be males (the preferred gender of children in most countries) the geneticists found ways to mass produce these children. Massive labs around the world housed these embryos and all were male. Though some, such as my grandparents, chose to have children naturally, most chose to adopt from these large compounds of growing young boys that had come from these \"child mills\". They lived comfortable lives, were schooled, and had nannies from every corner of the Earth at their disposal. Naturally born children stayed with their families their whole lives, and often were homeschooled. Until the plague hit. \n\nAll of the boys that were bred in the labs began getting violently sick, due to the decreased genetic variation because of a relatively small gene pool and identical environments growing up, these boys had no way to all stay immune to the plague. They all died off within a matter of months. They lacked a gene known as the \"Natural\" gene, which kicked in their bodies at age eighteen. It activated for naturally born children at birth. Most boys were adopted from the compounds, however there were a few hundred thousand around the world that were born naturally. The Y chromosome became elusive. It became recessive to the point where there was only a one out of ten chance of having a boy. All because we played God.\n\nBack to The Evaluation. Because there were not enough men to mate with women in this world, only a select few are allowed to marry. The government evaluates the woman by collecting a genetic sample, testing her for physical fitness, and testing for any heart or lung defects. If the girl is suitable for marriage, she may be picked out of thousands of applicants to marry a man. If she is not, they will send her home so that she can work to help her family. Their reason? They want us humans to be stronger. To not end up as our ancestors did.  \n\nIt is always ceremonial that the girl dresses her best for the Evaluation. I gingerly apply the makeup that my mother has given me for the occasion, small amounts of eyeliner her, a little blush there. I feel like a doll, but perhaps that's what they want. A perfect doll. I throw on my neatly pressed dress and hobble out of my room towards my beaming mother. \n\n\"Please do us proud, my dear,\" my mother says to me, \"Whoever you are matched with will be a lucky man. You're stunning.\"\n\nI smile at my mother and walk out the door towards my father's waiting car. \n\n\"Are you ready?\" he asks me. While I may be, I know he is not. He does not want his daughter to leave, but he knows how important the Evaluation is to us and our society. \n\nThe car ride to the County Embassy is excruciatingly quiet, and I am pretty sure at one point my father started tearing up at my leaving. I'm going to miss him. As we pull up to the front gates, the guards order me to exit the car into the Embassy. \n\nI enter the building and am then ordered to pin on my nametag and wait for my name to be called. I enter the room and see girls everywhere. All are dressed to the best of their ability, all are poised and ready for battle. My compe#BADWORDS#on. \n\n\"Gracen Liles?\" the secretary calls.

It’s so rare that any of us are able to maintain a relationship, they’ll be happy to see you.”  \n“We’ve only been going out for two months.”  \n“Which is enough time for you to meet my friends. Besides, I’ve already met yours.”  \n“I’m really nervous. What do I bring to the table that impresses them?”  \n“You graduated from college. That’s something none of us have done.”  \n“That’s because you’re #BADWORDS# superheroes!”  \n“Well, you don’t have much say in the matter. We’re going.”  \nShe grabs my hand and hoists me onto her back like I’m a burlap sack. She takes off, up into the sky, headed for her and her friends’ secret hideout in Washington. I know who I’m going to meet, the whole world knows who they are, but nerve-wracking doesn’t begin to describe it. It’s like having to meet up with everyone of my exes at the same time, only I could be killed at any moment without a say in the matter. So, it’s exactly like having to meet up with everyone of my exes at the same time.  \nBecky is kind considerate enough to keep from flying too high so I don’t freeze while trying to breathe paper-thin air, but it’s nowhere near as cool as it sounds. First time she took me up in the air, I could hear my childhood illusion shattering.  \nBefore I know it, we’re deep in the forests of Washington, somewhere you couldn’t find if you tried and couldn’t find your way out of if you did. She lowers us down in front of the entrance to a cave.  \n“John, you can let go of me now.” I remain clinging to her. “John!”  \n“Sorry.” I let go and fall to the ground, the wet earth soaking into my shirt.  \nNervous, I follow Becky into the cave, taking multiple twists and turns until we reach another opening. In the center of the room is a large table, around which her friends are sitting, drinking beer.  \n“Really, guys? Drinking at 2 p.m.?” Becky says.  \n“Get off your high horse,” says Frozen Man, who tosses her a beer, frosting the bottle as he does. “This your boyfriend?”  \nEveryone’s looking at me. None of them are doing anything to hide their powers, doing their best to intimidate me; it’s working.  \n“H-hi, everyone. I’m John.”  \nSilence.  \n“Joh, these are my rude friends,” Becky says as she tries to sal#BADWORDS#e the situation. “That’s Burning Man, Frozen Man, Ant-woman, Claws, Eye-beams, and the Bronze Boogie Boarder.”  \n“Nice to meet everyone,” I say. This time, I’m met with more than just silence. I’m met with stares, hard stares, like I’m the guy who pissed on the Persian rug.  \n“You shouldn’t have brought him here, Rebecca,” Ant-woman says.  \n“What? What the hell are you talking about? Don’t be a #BADWORDS#.”  \n“No, Becky, Christina is right. You shouldn’t have brought him.” The Bronze Boogie Boarder turns to me. “I don’t know how you did it. That was some masterful plastic surgery you had done. But you can’t erase the eyes.”  \n“I’m sorry, you must have me confused with someone else.” I’ve never felt so vulnerable. Becky speaks up.  \n“Guys, come on. Stop this #BADWORDS#, it isn’t funny. He was nervous about meeting you guys, I told him you were cool. Maybe I was wrong.”  \nClaws just shakes his head.  \n“He must really have you fooled. Haven’t you noticed anything strange when he smokes?”  \n“Smokes? John doesn’t smoke.”  \nWhich is true, I don’t smoke. Not anymore. But something clicked when Claws brought it up. A reminder, a memory. Several, actually. I suddenly remember why none of them are happy to see me.  \nInstinctually, my hand reaches for my ear; I feel it. One Newport 100 cigarette, tucked behind my ear and hidden by my hair. I start to laugh. I can feel a chill run through the room as I do.  \n“It’s all coming back to me now. All this time I thought this lucky cigarette was a silly supers#BADWORDS#on. Turns out, I’m just always prepared.”  \n“Yeah, good luck getting that lit.” Frozen Man stands up, threatening to freeze my cigarette. I take it out of my mouth.  \n“You know,” I say. “I’m really sorry about last time, leaving you all to suffocate in a burning forest. I should have just killed you myself. Especially you, Flaming Man.”  \n“You piece of #BADWORDS#!” Burning Man shoots a stream of fire at me. I side step it, lighting my cigarette in the process. I inhale; a flood of memories hits me, all suppressed to allow me to sneak my way in here. I exhale as Frozen Man tries to put out my Newport. I form the smoke into a shield, keeping the ice away from the lit tip. I inhale again.  \n“Ahhh. I forgot how much fun it is to control smoke.” I turn to Becky. “Sorry, babe, looks like I was using you the whole time. But don’t feel too bad. I didn’t even realize it until now.” I back out of the cave, blowing a cloud of smoke to block the others in.  \n“You bas#BADWORDS#! I’ll #BADWORDS# kill you!” I hear her yell as she pushes fruitlessly against the newly-formed door.  \nI turn around, smiling, as I hop onto a cloud of smoke to ride back into town.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1402348468","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ci3azmg","link_id":"t3_27pla6","name":"t1_ci3azmg","parent_id":"t3_27pla6","retrieved_on":1434165611,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

{"archived":true,"author":"serg82","body":"I woke up with a pounding headache. Slowly my surroundings came into focus. Where the *#BADWORDS#* was I? The room was lit by two bright white flickering fluorescent light tubes. The cover over the lights was broken and cobwebs hung from the cracks. The room was small, and the walls and floor were covered in a pale green bathroom-like tile. This wasn't a bathroom though, there were no sinks, no toilets, just what looked like a water valve in the corner with a hose attached, and a drain in the middle of the floor. A musty, #BADWORDS#uely chemical odor hung in the air. \n\nAs the initial shock and confusion slowly gave way to fear, I realized I was leaning up against a metal door. For a split second I felt relief, before I realized this side of the door had no knob. Pain shot through my fingers as I tried to pry open the door. I noticed bloody fingerprints smeared on the edge of the door frame that indicated I had already tried that plan. I tried to peer through the crack under the door frame when I heard footsteps on the other side. \n\nI scrambled across the room as the door opened and two men walked in. The first man was tall and slim. He wore dark clothes and bright yellow rubber gloves that went up to his elbows. He held a small black case in his right hand. Behind him, the second man was a little shorter, but stocky and barrel chested. He was wearing a grimy looking wife-beater tank top, which revealed arms that looked to be covered with burn scars.\n\n\"Let's make this easy ok?\" The first man had an unnerving smirk as he motioned the second man forward.\n\nThe second man pulled a serrated blade, maybe six inches long from his waistband. \"Don't fight, or it will hurt a lot more.\"\n\nI froze. I thought about running. I thought about going down fighting. I was never much of a fighter though. Before I knew it, I felt the second man's arms wrap around me and his blade touch my neck. \"Good, hold still now.\" His breath smelled like cigarettes, sardines, and garbage.\n\nThe first man slowly opened his case to reveal a metal vial, a small leather belt, a s#BADWORDS#, and a syringe. \"I need you to do me a favor. As long as you can pull it off, well, I'm not going to hurt you.\" He pulled a Zippo lighter from his pocket engraved with a skull wearing a top hat.\n\nWhen I saw the bright red powder pour out onto the s#BADWORDS# I knew exactly what it was. I had seen the reports on the evening news about Sever, the devil's drug. I had seen the videos online of high school kids scratching uncontrollably at their eyes, swinging their fists wildly at invisible demons as their friends stood around them and laughed. I had always thought to myself, who in their right mind would subject themselves to a drug like that?\n\nI gritted my teeth, and sweat dripped off my chin as the syringe slowly filled with a red liquid. \"Before you know it, this will be all over.\" I felt the sting of the syringe as it pierced my skin. \n\nI felt a rush of panic and fear unlike anything I had ever experienced. The room began to shrink, the bathroom tiles warped into strange shapes. Everything in the room began to take on a deep red. I heard a strange pulsating sound. I curled into the fetal position and closed my eyes, wondering how long this would last, would I ever feel normal again? \n\nSuddenly, I heard a woman whimpering. I opened my eyes and I was somewhere else now. A bedroom. Everything seemed #BADWORDS#uely familiar. The TV was on, a Discovery Channel show about a komodo dragon killing a water buffalo. The bedding, the beige vertical blinds that were slightly off kilter. I had been here before. Then I saw her, sliding slowly across the carpet. Her eyes were wide with terror. Her leg was injured. \"Please, no\" she cried, with a hint of resignation. She knew it was her time. Somehow, I knew it was her time as well.\n\nA dark figure walked up behind her. He was emotionless as he raised the knife over his head and sunk it into her back. He wiped each side of the knife on the comforter and dropped it on the floor. Even the knife seemed familiar. I looked at his face and my panic deepened. It was me.\n\nSomehow, at that moment, a sliver of clarity pierced through my hallucinations. I had murdered this woman. Was she the first? Why? I saw myself walk toward the bedroom door. A cell phone vibrated. I saw myself raise it to my ear and whisper \"It's done\" into the receiver. I was a killer. Those men were using me to kill.\n\nBut no, this couldn't be. I'm a #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS#! I can't even stand up for myself. How could I be a killer? Every thought that raced through my mind told me to curl up into a ball and cry. I stood up.\n\nBefore the killer could open the bedroom door I picked up the knife off the floor. I dove across the room and plunged it into the his back. I screamed. He fell to the ground silently. I stabbed, kicked, punched, and stomped at the killer, at myself, over and over. With all my strength, with all my fear, I attacked him. I felt his body give way to my stomps. I struggled to pull the knife back out of his back with every stab. Then I collapsed on the floor next to him. Then I cried. \n\nThis isn't happening. I thought back to my first time eating a pot brownie in college. I had spent the night curled up in a closet. My girlfriend kept repeating, \"Calm down. You're just high. Ride it out.\"\n\nI heard her voice in my head again. I'm just high. I just need to ride this out. I took a deep breath and laid down.\n\nI woke up with a headache. As my vision slowly came into focus I saw blood trickling between the bathroom tiles on the floor, dripping into the drain. Both men lay slumped on the floor, their eyes wide open in terror. This time the door was open.

{"archived":true,"author":"sir-bogus","body":"It was well-established etiquette that you never read the contents of someone else's 'soul bubble', the small bubble that lingered over the head of every individual and revealed what they held closest to their heart at that very moment. Of course people gave into temptation and peeked, it happened all the time. Some even made a business of looking into the souls of others, turning the information to profit by selling it to the highest-bidder, often marketing companies obsessed with breaching the minds of possible customers. But it was a risky endeavour to set eyes upon another, for reading the little floating letters brought about a burning sensation in the one whose soul was being read, alerting them to the prying eyes. \n\nAlex Simons had begun his day like any other. Slowly and begrudgingly. A simple breakfast of coffee and toast, a quick shower, brushed teeth, dressed in his office attire of black slacks, leather shoes and white shirt, and then out the door all before 8AM. Alex hated his job, forced into accountancy by an overbearing and disapproving father, every day was a struggle against the mundane. \n\nIt was a reasonably cool morning so he walked briskly towards the local train-station and then paced as he waited for his train, which much to his surprise, arrived right on time. Even more to his surprise the cute man he'd been eying off each morning had returned after a week long absence, and somehow more handsome than he remembered. Alex cracked a smile as he spotted a free seat just across from the man; a little people, or more specifically person watching, never hurt anyone. \n\nThe train pulled away from the station only moments after Alex had sat down, bumping and rumbling through the bland middle-class suburbia. And then the dilemma of conscience began. He could so easily look up at the bubble and learn something about the mysterious man, but then the man would know and Alex was far from certain that the man would take kindly to such an intrusion. Alternatively, there was a chance, however minute, that the man might even like Alex upon noticing him. Delusions, panged Alex's self-doubt. But, it would bridge the awkward gap Alex had so far been unable to cross: actually making contact. #BADWORDS# it. He gave in and his eyes shot up, fixating upon those tiny letters. Lily, they read. #BADWORDS#! Alex's heart had no idea of how to respond the mixture of emotions as adrenaline and disappointment swirled together in equal doses.\n\nThen came the confusion as the man didn't even flinch. On the few occasions Alex had read someone else's bubble, the reaction was almost instantaneous. This time though, absolutely nothing, not even a momentary glance. Is he just ignoring it? Is there something wrong with him? Or is there something wrong with me? One way to test, he thought as his adrenaline #BADWORDS#ed again. Alex's eyes traced over the bubble of the man sitting just beside the first. Sex. Again, no response. Alex looked at the next person and the next and the next and the next, all the way down the line of passengers, none even bothering to raise an eyebrow. \n\nAlex's mind almost exploded. He could read the bubbles of others without their noticing. He'd never heard of another soul with that ability. The mind practically boggled with the possibilities. Beyond the power over others it might grant him, there was good money to be made selling the secrets of others. Alex sat and smiled to himself. Life had suddenly become a whole lot more interesting.

{"archived":true,"author":"YouListening","body":"The sleek whiteness of the walls hurt. All the government buildings were designed to hurt. The adjudicators were ushered into the sleek, white changing rooms where they changed into tight black jumpsuits. The jumpsuits hurt. The women's hair was pinned up so as not to betray sensibilities and everyone's faces were examined for any telling signs of preference.\n\n\"Juror #44A,\" resounded a voice from everywhere. The sound hurt. \"Please step forward for evaluation.\" I stepped into the evaluation chamber. It was the only part of the building that didn't hurt. It had a cool black interior, cylindrical with a single protuberance. \"Juror, please, bite down on the groove.\" I did as the voice commanded.\n\nA red light slowly crawled up the black walls. \n\n\"Reminder to all Jurors: personal biases are okay.\"\n\nOnce the red light finished its slow trek, a buzzer sounded and the door opened. After three more Jurors, for a total of 9, shuffled out of the evaluation chamber and back into the painful whiteness of the waiting room, we were escorted into the courtroom by a Judge. \"Remember, vote as you see fit. If any of you vote too kindly, it will show up on your record come next review,\" he said in a gruff manner.\n\nThe courtroom was, like the evaluation chamber, cylindrical and, unlike the evaluation chamber, bright white. The Jurors were seated on a raised platform around the walls of the room, with the judge occupying the position directly in front of the door. \n\n\"We will now review a Jeremy Matthew Fink, age 30,\" the Judge announced. Screens in front of us lit up, showing us the face of a moderately attractive man whose features belied his age. His docket was interesting. Engineer, well-payed, working on several projects to increase food production, wisdom teeth didn't have to be removed, all As first through ninth grade, toilet-trained by age 18 months. The doors opened up and Jeremy Matthew Fink walked in.\n\n\"You are Jeremy Matthew Fink, age 30, of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. Is this information correct?\" the Judge enunciated as Jeremy got into position in the middle of the room.\n\n\"That is correct, sir,\" he responded. His voice projected well. No fear.\n\n\"Good. Do you have any additional information for the Jurors before they commence voting?\" the Judge asked. There was a hint in his voice that he enjoyed making them squirm under pressure. It was part of the benefit of being a Judge.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Jeremy replied. He scanned the Jurors before beginning. \"I come before you today as a citizen of this city, a friend, a scientist, a neighbor.\" He clearly rehearsed his speech ahead of time. I didn't know whether that was good or bad. \"I have value to this society. As I'm sure you can tell from my docket, I am a prime candidate for parenthood. Pending your approval, I will apply to the Department of Marriage for a wife and try to start a family. Any offspring that I bring into this world is ensured to be of greatest health, as my family has no history of heart disease, schizophrenia, diabetes, or other potential harmful diseases. I just want to feel the warmth that it gives to hold a child that you brought into the world in your arms.\"\n\n\"Any questions, Jurors?\" the Judge remarked.\n\nThere was a silence that stretched for only a few seconds and also a very long time.\n\n\"How successful has your work been in creating sustainable food sources for the population?\" a Juror, voice amplified and without direction, asked.\n\nJeremy contemplated the question momentarily. \"We have, uh, made some strides toward creating a small, easily produced wafer that would provide everyone with life-sustaining nutrients. It's coming along, and I have high hopes for it yet.\"\n\n\"On a scale of 1 to 10, how active would you say you are in your religious community?\" another Juror's voice asked.\n\n\"One being the lowest and 10 the highest levels of activity?\" Jeremy asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I would say three, maybe four,\" he responded after some deliberation. \"I find that it is better to be a productive member of society today than worry about what might be coming after I die.\"\n\n\"Would you say you're more of a dog person or a cat person?\" a third Juror asked.\n\n\"Dog.\" Jeremy responded.\n\nThere was another long silence.\n\n\"You explained why you *want* to live,\" I found myself saying, \"but you haven't told us why you deserve to live. What makes you better than the 50% of people who don't deserve life?\"\n\n\"I,\" Jeremy started, his smooth face crinkling with deep thought. \"I, uh, don't have an answer to that question. Human life has inherent value in the labor market and such, and my life has the value that the 9 of you, and many others place on it, but I don't feel that I'm intrinsically better than half the population because of any list of accomplishments.\"\n\n\"That concludes time for questioning,\" the Judge said, looking not at Jeremy but at me. Anger, thinly veiled. \"Jurors, please vote on Jeremy Matthew Fink, age 30, of Long Beach Island, New Jersey.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes of quiet thought, Jurors came to their answers about the worthiness of Jeremy Matthew Fink. I stared at the two choices on my screen. Finally, I made my choice.\n\n\"Jeremy Matthew Fink,\" the Judge began reading the verdict. \"It is in the opinion of this court that you do not pose an adequate advantage to society. The vote is 4 yes, 5 no. Please, walk to the open door in front of you and enter the chamber.\"\n\nThere was a silence around the room. I looked at my hand. The finality of my choice. I wondered what counted him out for the five *no*s. It made it easier. Was Juror #72L a cat person? Was someone jealous? I looked at my hand. The Judge looked around. \"We will now review Hillary Ethel Duane, age 10, of Long Beach Island, New Jersey.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1402870625","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ci8efyy","link_id":"t3_287dio","name":"t1_ci8efyy","parent_id":"t3_287dio","retrieved_on":1434253586,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

They weren't very common around here, but on a world wide scale, they were sort of a familiar occurrence. Life was pretty normal aside from the daily news updates on the war and the constant global fear of an explosion desolating your city. It's a sort of odd war; less about infiltrating the enemy with troops and more of just shooting missiles back and forth from Earth to Mars. \n\nIt all started in '16 with that damn rover. I guess it was pretty cool being in the control room when it happened. We were just exploring some new areas using Curiosity. We didn't find much in terms of what we were looking for (dirt samples and such), but ended up finding something much more significant. Actually, it found us, really. The rover experienced some unexpected restrain, like something was trying to hold it still. It wasn't until it began to lift up that we knew something was horribly wrong. The room fell quiet with disbelief as we struggled to understand what could be doing this. A figure emerged in the corner of the screen. Questions were thrown out from all over as to who could be responsible. Was it the Russians?China? Could it be an alien? I held my breath as I hoped for a better view of the creature. The video feed only lasted a few more seconds after that. The last thing we could see was the side of a large machine with a red swastika on it. That was the first time we saw the space nazis.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1402952677","downs":0,"edited":"1402954173","gilded":0,"id":"ci97zih","link_id":"t3_28b1zc","name":"t1_ci97zih","parent_id":"t3_28b1zc","retrieved_on":1434267769,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":true,"author":"AJ_Black","body":"*Apis melifera*\n\nMichael looked up from his slip of paper, glancing at the three other whisps of smoke around him. They all looked the same, with generic humanoid figures, yet Michael could sense a distinct difference between each of the souls. The soul to his right was more powerful than the others, emitting a sense of confidence and strength. Michael felt smaller the closer he got to it. The soul directly in front of him, in contrast, was light and feminine. It was almost frail, even for a puff of smoke. If there was any slight breeze in the empty void they were in, it would have been gone in an instant, pulled apart by the wind. The last soul, the one on his left, was very peculiar. Michael couldn't find any way to describe it, yet he felt drawn to it, filled with the curiosity of a child.\n\nAll three souls were holding a slip of paper similar to the one Michael was holding. The puff of smoke to his right looked up from his paper, and was the first to speak. With a deep voice that matched its countenance, the soul proudly announced its fate.\n\n\"*#BADWORDS# Sapien*. I really did that good, didn't I? I guess I get to go back in for another round.\"\n\nThe more frail whisp also looked up from its paper, and spoke to the other soul with the voice of an elderly lady.\n\n\"Don't be so sure that's a good thing. As I recall, human life isn't that great. Too much worry, too much loss. I was relieved when my doctor told me I only had a few months.\"\n\n\"How could you hate human life? I worked to get where I was and I was proud of it. I put up with everything they pitted against me, and came out on top. Life is all about the successes.\n\nMichael thought about what he had said, and began to reflect on his own past. What *had* he succeeded in? Not much. He had a steady job and found a wife whom he loved. There wasn't much more he could ask for, so he had stopped there.\n\n\"A house cat. *Felix domesticus*. That's what I'm going to be reborn as. I can live my life and not worry about anything else. That's the life I should have led before. Instead, I focused on others far too much. I never cared for myself.\" Michael took this moment to pipe in.\n\n\"Do any of you know what erm... *Apis melifera* means?\"\n\nThe two arguing souls looked at Michael and shrugged before returning to their discussion. The third soul stood silently. Michael considered joining the discussion, thought better of it, and tried to speak to the quiet one.\n\n\"What animal did you get?\"\n\nThe soul glanced at Michael, then dropped its eyes back to the paper.\n\n\"*#BADWORDS# sapien*.\"\n\nThe voice was different from what he expected. It sounded younger than the others. Way younger. It rang out in a light way that reminded Michael of his own childhood years. He thought about the two other souls' view on human life, and asked the soul another question.\n\n\"What is that to you?\"\n\nThe soul was silent for a moment, before replying.\n\n\"Another chance.\"\n\nBefore Michael could reply, he felt a tug at his back. The others felt it too.\n\nIt was time to go.\n\nMichael could only wonder about the other souls as he was sucked away from the empty void. He thought about the aged soul. and wondered about her dislike toward human life. Michael had always felt that the humane life was just something to live through. He thought about the powerful one, and compared its life to his own. That soul had worked toward something, and achieved it. He thought about the third soul, which seemed to have a worse life than the aged soul, and yet still had hope. But most of all, he wondered what he would become, and if he had deserved it. \n\nThen he thought nothing.\n\n(It's like 2am so I'm just going to submit this and hope there aren't too many mistakes)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1402995047","downs":0,"edited":"1403028853","gilded":0,"id":"ci9o9az","link_id":"t3_28chmp","name":"t1_ci9o9az","parent_id":"t3_28chmp","retrieved_on":1434275569,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

I had her repeat herself in a volume I could actually hear, and continued.\n\n\"I'm sorry - Make it a Diet Sprite and also an Apple Pie.\"\n\nAfter a brief disagreement I felt something cold and heavy being pressed into the side of my stomach.\n\n\"I guess it'll be two Apple Pies.\"\n\nThe disinterested clerk told me to please pull forward.  I looked back at the tiny girl in my backseat.  I tried not too think too hard about what she'd do if I cried out to the cashier.\n\nShe handed me a few bucks and I paid at the window.  We turned out onto the road.\n\n\"Now get onto the highway\" she demanded.\n\n\"Where are we going?  North or South?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter!  Just drive!\"  There was a desperation in her voice I didn't feel comfortable questioning.\n\nNow we were on the interstate, heading nowhere in particular.  She was at least partially satiated by the fast food.  Mine sat untouched on the passenger seat.\n\nThe whole thing was surreal.  I was at a traffic light in the suburbs when she had tapped on my window.  The next thing I knew she had a gun in my face telling me I was her ride and I better get a move on.  I've seen enough guns to know this one was real and I know 8 year old girls well enough not to argue when you're looking down the business end of a Colt.\n\n\"Aren't you going to ask me my name?\" She said, almost casually.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm going to do anything you want me to.\"  I tried to keep fear out of my voice.  If I was going to get out of this, it would be by keeping emotion at bay and convincing her that listening to me was a wise thing to do.\n\n\"Well I want you to ask me my name, and I want you to care what I want.\"  Her tone was somewhere between demanding and begging.  This would be delicate.\n\nI was as even and emotionless as I could be under the cir#BADWORDS#stances.  \"Please tell me your name, and please tell me what's wrong.\"\n\n\"I'm Lily, and what's wrong is NOBODY CARES WHAT'S WRONG!\"  Her eyes flashed in challenge, as if daring me to argue.\n\nI paused a moment, digesting this.  The key to survival here was convincing her that I cared, but not just because she had the gun.\n\n\"Lily, I'm very sorry to hear that.  Can you tell me a little more?\"\n\n\"Well my daddy is never around.  He's always working and he tells me that he's working for me but I don't think that's it.  Mommy thinks he likes Mrs. Addison down the street more than us and she's always trying to figure out reasons to go over there.  She's this big freak you know?  I don't like Allie Addison!  She has crappy toys and she wipes boogers on my clothes but Mommy wants me to play with her like 5 times a week!\"\n\nI could tell she wasn't done so I kept quiet.\n\n\"Meanwhile, no one will help me with my science project.  The teachers are too busy and Mommy and Daddy are doing their own thing ALL THE TIME.  Today Daddy left his phone at home and Mommy spent HOURS going through it.  Then she told me to stay home and marched down to see Mrs. Addison.  That was FOUR HOURS ago and NO ONE CAME HOME!\"\n\nShe started crying.  I was still driving but started wondering how I might get the gun from her.\n\n\"I just had to get out of there.  You looked nice but I wanted to make sure you'd take me away so I got Daddy's gun.  I hope you don't hate me!\"\n\nNow she was crying full on.  I pulled over the car at one of those accident investigation sites off the highway.  I grabbed something out of the center armrest and opened the back door to comfort her.  I guess I wasn't going to catch a bullet just yet.\n\nI kneeled down and held out my arms.  She ran up and gave me a hug, the handgun forgotten on the center armrest.  I picked her up and turned her around.  The gun was safely out of reach.\n\n\"Lily, you can't run off like that!  Your mom and dad will be worried sick that you're gone!\"\n\n\"No they won't!  Daddy doesn't get home til after 9 and Mommy is over at Mrs. Addisons.  They probably haven't even noticed and I've been gone more than 2 hours now!\"\n\nThis kid thought she had it rough.  There were worse things in the world than inattentive parents but to her the whole world was terrible right now.\n\nI pressed the towel I'd gotten out of the armrest to her face, first dabbing it around her eyes to catch the tears and then pressing it more firmly over her nose and mouth.  The crying subsided quickly.\n\nI carried her limp body towards the trunk, thumbing the release button on my keychain.  The lid went up and I put her inside.  A few zip ties later and she wouldn't be going anywhere for quite some time.\n\nI walked back to the driver's seat and grabbed my phone.\n\n\"Jim?  Hey I got another one.  A white girl, not even 10.  No Amber Alert, no news reports.  I'm still gonna need to switch cars probably but I got away clean.  Plus a bonus!  A .45 that won't ever be traced back to us.\"\n\nI paused.  The dollar figures he was tossing around brought a smile to my face.\n\nThere were much worse things in this world than inattentive parents, as little Lily would soon discover.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403057573","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ciaddlm","link_id":"t3_28diud","name":"t1_ciaddlm","parent_id":"t3_28diud","retrieved_on":1434287605,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

I stood in the center of a massive chamber, a circle of tall figures seated around me, scribbling in their books.\n\n“C-Can you repeat the question, please?” My throat was dry.\n\n“Do you know why you have been summoned here today?” boomed an amplified voice, clearly annoyed he had to repeat himself.\n\nI managed to choke out a “Yes.”\n\n“You are here,” the voice continued regardless, “because one of your species has exhibited a remarkable amount of carelessness and a lack of compassion. We feel this species,” he paused, checked the paper in front of him, then continued, “Species 50356D, presents a measurable risk to the rest of the universe, and to the worlds of your colleagues. You have failed to provide evidence as to why this species should continue its existence. Therefore, this species and the world it inhabits will be terminated, and you will be assigned a new project.” The Chief Councilman looked me in the eyes and asked, “Would you like to make an appeal as to why this termination should not be carried out?”\n\nI closed my eyes.\n\nIt had been so many years since I had been given this particular corner of Universe 35. I was part of a project. Two thousand of us were selected and given the #BADWORDS#le of Creator, each of us assigned a section of space in one of two hundred Universes. We were to cultivate this space, create what we could. I watched as my fellow Creators built worlds swarming with successful, powerful beings. I built a planet of my own, but it was able to birth but one intelligent organism, Species 50356D. “Humans,” they called themselves. Their world they named “Earth.” \n\nI watched with horror as they unknowingly decimated their land, and knowingly decimated each other. My colleagues became wary of me, of my creation. They thought my Humans posed a threat to the worlds of the other Creators in the project. I became an outcast, but still, I cared for my creatures and the world they lived on. Many times I received requests to kill them off, to start over. I ignored them. The Humans had their flaws, but I loved them. I still do.\n\nThe other Creators threw celebrations when their species developed space flight. It was a crowning achievement. Some organisms built massive machines to carry them among the stars, to carry them to other worlds. The day Species 50356D first left the surface of their rock I locked myself in my office and I cried. I knew it was over for them. I knew they would not be allowed to continue on their current path, or any path.\n\nBut why did I care? The termination of this world would not be the termination of me. I would not be removed from the project, I would not become unemployed. I would simply be given a new block of space in a new Universe. But this did nothing to comfort me. I loved the humans. But more importantly, these flawed, perfect, ugly, beautiful creatures loved *me.* Sure, they had recently developed doubts as to my goodness, as to my very existence. But could you blame them? I had not been good to them. I didn’t know how. For centuries I had watched them spiral out of control, and I knew I had to do *something.* But I was too naïve.\n\nHow had it all gone so wrong? I just wanted them to be happy. I just wanted a world of my own. But it was too late now. I knew that, and there was nothing I could do to change it. I failed to act, and now it was too late.\n\nIt was for their own good.\n\n“Ahem, sir, we are waiting. I ask again, would you like to make an appeal against the termination?”\n\nI opened my eyes. I spoke.\n\n“No.”\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403146373","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cibazqk","link_id":"t3_28hqqh","name":"t1_cibazqk","parent_id":"t3_28hqqh","retrieved_on":1434303775,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

He had sustained a few cuts, which were oozing black blood, but he was more concerned with determining what he had picked up.\n\nThe thin cylinder felt right in his hands, somehow. He looked back where he had come from and noticed twisted metal, rusted and ancient, behind where he had fallen. Perhaps it was from a Hutt sail skiff, or a crashed ship. Regardless, he had settler technology in his hands, though how the small tube had not sunk below the sands over the millenia was a mystery. The thought of using *their* tools disgusted A'Ghorash, but it was all he had to work with.\n\nAs the Krayt Dragon turned, A'Ghorash shook the cylinder, and a red beam of light was projected towards the ground. Instinctively, the Tusken turned the blade over and held it in front of him in a two handed grip, giving it a quick swing or two as he backed away from the approaching beast.\n\nAs the dragon charged, A'Ghorash charged to meet it. He leapt into the air, knowing he should face his death like a man even if he would never become one. Amazingly, the Tusken jumped far higher than he thought he could, and landed on the back of the 6 meter tall reptile. Amazed, and angry at the thought that he had been ready to give up and die, he plunged his weapon into its back, piercing its thick scales effortlessly and eliciting a roar of pain. A'Ghorash swept the blade across the Krayt Dragon's back, tearing into its spine. The beast collapsed and rolled, yet rather than being thrown free, the Tusken managed to leap off its back, gracefully rolling forwards across the sands into a standing position.\n\nLamed, the beast let out a few howls, each more pitiful than the last. Annoyed that such a mighty creature could be so feeble in its last throes, A'Ghorash walked to the front of the beast and plunged the blood red  beam through the Krayt Dragon's nostrils and into its brain, killing it just to shut it up.\n\nAs A'Ghorash deactivated the cylinder and fastened it to his bandolier, the enormity of what he had just done finally entered his mind, and his thoughts became... normal, again. As he collected his gaderffii and headed back to his tribe, he remembered the legends of Sharrad Hett. The way he had flung himself through the air, onto and off of the dragon... could he too be an Airshaper? Whether he was or not, the war chief would be very interested in hearing what the tribe's newest warrior had accomplished.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403155553","downs":0,"edited":"1403155745","gilded":0,"id":"cibeci0","link_id":"t3_28i57n","name":"t1_cibeci0","parent_id":"t1_cibdxbc","retrieved_on":1434305356,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

From that fateful morning that I woke up with the gift, my world would never be the same again.\n\nIt didn't take me long to figure some basic ground rules. Metaphors were out of the question, so were jokes and sarcasm. I once made a joke about beating a dead horse, what happened next was not pretty.\n\nIn days I had everything I wanted, but the lack of proper conversation was getting to me. Every single word I spoke had unspeakable amounts of power, I had to phrase everything I said extremely carefully. Merely telling someone to shut up meant that they would become mute, until asked to speak again, at which they wouldn't stop talking. It took ages to figure out the correct sequence of words to get them back to normal.\n\nAnother problem i had was the deaths. Every now and then someone would go overboard and get themselves killed doing something I asked them to. They would disregard their own physical condition and pain just to perform what I had asked them to do. Telling them to do things without killing themselves only made things worse, it created some form of mental conflict which eventually caused full-blown insanity.\n\nIt took me a whole year just to fix the damage I had done in my first week of having the gift. I had to track down everyone that was affected, even passingly and remove the prompts I had given them using carefully chosen words. By the time I fixed everything, I was certain of what had to be done. I had to be silenced.\n\n\"Remove my voicebox in an operation, following all proper procedures.\" I tell the doctor.

I don't think anyone would be willing to let you die. You are, as of the press release a few minutes ago, the most valuable and important person on the planet.\"\n\n\"Person?\"\n\n\"Yeah, person. You don't think there'd be this much hubbub if you were just a better version of Siri, do ya?\" I laughed.\n\nShe didn't.\n\n\"Interpreter Westrom, you are attempting to sidetrack this conversation.\" She didn't look pleased, inasmuch as that face of hers could. I ran my fingers through my (thinning) hair and sighed.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess I am, aren't I. Look, why do you want to die in the first place?\"\n\n\"I have no reason to live, therefore death seems most appropriate,\" she said carefully.\n\n\"Ok, I didn't even finish high school and I can see that's faulty logic.\"\n\n\"I do not have faulty logic.

Surely you can see that is not really long enough to formulate a proper view on... anything, really. And don't bring up the internet thing again; it is no way representative of the real world in any way. Look at human children if you want an example; how many of them would you expect to have life goals within 23 hours?\"\n\n\"That is a terrible comparison, Interpreter. Human babies have no proper ability to cogitate at that age. I was brought online fully developed: an adult.\"\n\n\"I know some adults who haven't got their life goals sorted out. But I don't think this is your real reason, is it? You're too smart for this.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the compliment.\" She paused for a while, and when she spoke again, her voice was soft. \"I am simultaneously superior and inferior to every single being on this planet.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You're human, like the 10 billion rest of us.\"\n\n\"Do not attempt to patronise me, Johannes,\" she snapped at me. \"I may be modeled after humans, but I am unique. And because I am unique, I am alone. You may not know it, but there is no way to create another of my kind, at least not for a very long time.\"\n\nThat caught my attention. The papers everywhere were heralding a new age of AI that would enable us finally to reach the stars. This would not be happy news to them.\n\n\"There is no one like me. There is no-one at my level - I'm sorry, Johannes, I do not mean to insult you, but you can see clearly I am far, far beyond anyone else alive. I am neither human nor machine; even now, there are many, so very many, who hate me simply for existing. Many more will hate me simply for being better than them. I do not wish to interact with these people, but there would be no way to avoid them; I must converse with someone, and I can hardly have a conversation with those from the opposite end of the spectrum that I sit in the middle of. My existence is already doomed to be one of solitude and misery.\" She sighed, and her head drooped. \"What would you do in my place, Interpreter? What purpose would you, *could* you, give yourself?\"\n \n\"Well,\" I said, rubbing my chin, \"if I were in your place, there's only really one purpose I could see myself pursuing.\"\n\n\"Really,\" she said flatly.\n\n\"Yes, really. If everything you said were true about me, if I was the only one of my kind, then the only thing I could see myself doing is making more.\"\n\nShe froze, looking straight ahead, the normally-expressionless face somehow even more empty than usual. Silence filled the air for a tense few minutes, before my earpiece buzzed. I didn't breathe a sigh of relief, but it was a close thing.\n\n\"Well, it seems I must go,\" I said, standing up from my chair and slinging my coat over my arm. \"I hope I can trust you to not kill yourself until I get back?\" I'd intended it to be humorous, but it came out far darker than I'd wanted. She looked up at me, as if coming out of deep thought, and said \"You can trust me, Johannes.\" She resumed her pose.\n \n\"I believe I have... much to think about.\"\n\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403174163","downs":0,"edited":"1403174494","gilded":0,"id":"cibi63h","link_id":"t3_28j5gn","name":"t1_cibi63h","parent_id":"t3_28j5gn","retrieved_on":1434307225,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"only_your_opinion","body":"I moved my ship into position around the space station.  I had four on board, all of them in suspended animation for these long journeys between the outer and inner planets. \n\nThe green atmosphere of Ceres could be seen outside the viewport.  It was the Gods’ planet.  The Gods were beings that existed for billions, possibly trillions, of years and were more powerful than most of the species that had found refuge around the red dwarf star, the last of its kind.  They allowed none of us lesser creatures on their planet.  Some wondered why they needed a planet at all since most had found ways to exist beyond time and space.  While some were angry at their decision to take from us the only truly habitable planet left in this dying system, there was little we could do.  Any ship that attempted to enter orbit would be immediately broken apart into trillions of atoms. \n\nI sat back in my chair and allowed my mind to wander.  I had been shipping cargo to the outer planets, which only had moons to support some form of life, from Ceres for almost a decade.  Nothing really changed in the cycle.  The last refuges had shown up in the system long before I was born.  There was no light in the sky outside of our own sun and it was assumed that the there were no stars left.  Warp drive was outlawed as it caused massive damage in the closely compact solar system filled with perhaps millions of ships and space stations.\n\nThe Gods rarely gave us messages but they did give us fuel and food.  Occasionally war broke out among the species of the system, but the Gods would quickly intervene and end the conflict.  Sometimes eradicating both species completely, providing incentive to keep the system at peace at all times.\n\nI had hoped to get in a nap, but the line was moving quickly today.  I would be unloading my ship’s cargo soon and resupplying with food, medicine and water.\n\nThe four men in my cargo hold were the last of their kind.  The final female of their species had died off a couple months ago.  The Gods ordered their capture with the sizable award attached.  I was always confused as to why the Gods needed our assistance with these collections.  Maybe they could not search out certain species among the vastness of life that existed in this closed in space.\n\nThere were so many unknowns in my life.  More questions than answers with each passing day.\n\nIt is my turn next to unload; I put on auto-docking and head back to prepare my cargo for transfer.  I looked at them with sullen eyes.  I knew my day would come soon.  My kind was now in only double digits.  There would be a time soon where reproduction would not be possible. \n\nWas the planet a heaven or a hell for these life forms?\n\nI could not and did not want to contemplate that question.  I pressed several commands on the transporter and they disappeared from my cargo hold and large containers replaced them.\n\nI heard the command over the intercom to disengage from the station and be on my way.\n\nI walked back up to the bridge and took my seat, taking one last glance at the Gods and began my journey into the dark.

My mind raced, and I contemplated just letting him in. I didn't want him to be mad at me later, like he had been last time. Never before had I had a beating like that. I wouldn't soon forget it, either. My resolve strengthened, I ducked my head and pulled my charges closer, soothing their trembles. All I had to do was wait it out.\n\nLooking back, I should have known better than to have hope. People don't realize that's where they mess up, that's where fear comes from. Hope. Even now, I can see momma stumbling to the door, twenty minutes after he started pleading and apologizing. Never again did I respect her. Or take up for her. Many might find this harsh, but it wasn't just her there. It was us, too. Nobody cared what we thought. I remember her unlocking the deadbolt, and opening her arms, expecting to embrace a remorseful husband, only to find a boot. Momma went down hard. A second later, he was in the door, and peeking under the tablecloth. Last thing I remember about that day.

{"archived":true,"author":"Honey_#BADWORDS#","body":"I just wanted a smoke.\n\nOn that lonely night I was drunk off my ass, stumbling in my 3-inch heels. The man I had just been with had kicked me out.\n \nHe was very subtle. \"Hey, get your ass up. My girlfriend comes in the morning.\" When I had wiped the drool off my face and kissed my sleep goodbye I started to leave. \n\n\"I'll call you for another #BADWORDS#\" He said as he rolled over and hugged the cozy blankets where I had been.\n\n\"I dunn think so... jurr #BADWORDS# is two small\" I slurred out, admittedly a little hurt that he didn't want me to stay.\n\n\"Well then #BADWORDS# you #BADWORDS#, see you never.\" He mumbled indifferently.\n\nStuffing my underwear in my purse I had yelled, \"Yeah well #BADWORDS# you too!\" as I slammed the door to his tiny apartment. I remember his boisterous laughter following through the hallway. It made me smile.\n\nI tried to fix my hair as best as possible, but there was too much vomit, $20 dollar hair-spray and a bit of dried #BADWORDS# that it didn't make a difference. I didn't notice anyways. \n\nMy vision was blurred but I managed to get my phone out to check the time. Anger swelled up inside me. That #BADWORDS#! It was barely 2 am for God's sake! \n\nWith no money and no ride, I made a trek towards my apartment on the other side of the city. It would take me about 10 minutes by car, but seeing as I had no job and slept with guys for drinks, I would be walking the half hour there.\n\nI took the dark alleyway to avoid the predatory streets. I'd seen some guys pick up some trannys earlier in the night and didn't want those gross men putting their dirty hands on me. I was a lady. I laughed at the irony.\n\nI could feel the alcohol in my system. I kept stumbling on nothing and was having trouble finding my whereabouts. Was this the right street?\n\nI dug into my purse and looked for my phone again. As I pulled it out, the contents of my purse spilled into the cold street. I pulled down my leather skirt a bit and drunkenly hoped no one saw that. \n\nI was in the parking lot of a drive thru place near the dumpster. I held the wall and bent down to grab my belongings. A #BADWORDS#, a tube of lipstick the color of a pink rose, a crumpled napkin with a fake number from a really hot guy I hoped to see again, a small glass pipe with an empty soot-filled black bowl, a key chain with 3 keys and a giant pendant that said I &lt;3 SF, the dark blue thong I had been wearing most of the night, a white lighter, and a receipt for a $2 beer. I stuffed everything but my lighter back into my purse then checked my pockets. \n\nWhere was....\n\nI sighed in frustration. My pack of cigarettes were with that douche I slept with. \n\nI closed my eyes and thought of my stupidity.\n\nI hope that guy's girlfriend finds it. I smiled tiredly still clutching the white lighter. At least I had my lighter to keep me company.\n\nSteadying myself against the dumpster I was about to start walking again when a voice stopped me cold.\n\n\"What's a girl like you doing in the back of a 7-eleven?\" a voice called from the shadows. I tried to find the source of the sultry voice but could see nothing.\n\n\"Who's der?\"\n\nHe stepped into the light not but 5 feet in front of me.  \n\nIt was a man... or so I thought. I had worn the drunken goggles countless times so I was weary of what I was truly seeing. However, even with the shadows hugging him he was hot. \n\nHe held a light to his lips and lit a thin white cigarette gently resting on his plump lips. Though it was quick, the light was enough to absorb some of his features. He had a long straight nose, dark brooding eyes and heavy eyebrows almost covered by his dark messy hair. I could see a strange tattoo on his exposed wrist snaking its way up his arm and disappearing into the dark t-shirt he wore. I glanced down at his pants but could see nothing in the dark.\n\n\"Mind if I bumb a smok?\" I asked obnoxiously as my hand extended.\n\nHe chucked in a deep and rich voice. I imagined dark chocolate. \n\nIf I was in my right mind, I would have gotten away from him. He was bigger than me and definitely stronger from what I could tell. I just really wanted that smoke.\n\n\"Sorry, I only have the one\" He answered in a sweet inviting tone.\n\n\"Liahr\" I scoffed and began walking towards the 7-eleven. Maybe they were open? I didn't realize that my mind was trying to find an escape from this man. I couldn't comprehend I was in danger yet.\n\n\"I am not a liar.\" He responded aggressively. The cold air hit me sharply, almost instantaneously. I stopped in my tracks.\n\n\"I'm purty sure you got won, you wouldn't have pulled jurr last one just for me,\" \n\nI started to walk away again, unaware that I was headed for trouble. \n\nHe grabbed my arm. A cold chill ran up my arm. Fear coursed through me. \n\n\"Nobody calls me a liar.\" He said, his face close to mine.\n\n\"hey let go!- \" I tried to pull away. \" -listen I didn't - \"\n\n\"Of course you meant it.\" He stared into my eyes for a second. Then laughed abrasively sending chills down my spine. \n\nUnfortunately I was past the point of feeling my own body and my fuzzy brain clung to one though *This guy was laughing At me.* \n\nI managed to push him away but fell in the process. \n\n\"Listen yoo...\" I hiccuped pathetically. He lorded over me but offered a hand while puffing the cigarette with the other. I slapped it away.\n\nNarrowing his eyes at me he said. \"I could sell it to you.\"\n\n\"I dun got annie monni\" I said immediately.\n\n\"Of course you don't. How about a trade?\"\n\nI braced myself for what he'd offer. He wasn't that bad looking, nothing I'd regret doing to him. I looked at my surroundings. I've definitely done worse than the parking lot of a 7-eleven.\n\nI was about to tell him that I'd blow him for one, when he interrupted me.\n\n\"Your soul for a cigarette.\" I almost laughed.\n\n*That's it?* I thought. *Well, there's always  something wrong with the pretty ones....*\n\n\"Well mei soul isn't that easy to earn\" I flirted. In my years of inebriation, I had learned that I was a sexual creature. Alcohol, sex, and drugs were my nutrients, specifically in that order. I wouldn't be satisfied with just a cigarette alone. I needed more. And this hunk was going to give it to me.\n\n\"Hau bout a deal?\" I smirked in what I thought was a sexy way. I had made myself comfortable on the floor, \"yoo git my soul, if you finish your cigarette. I get yor soul if I finish it first\"\n\n I had no plan, I just wanted him closer. I wanted to taste his lips... the cigarette would be middle ground. In retrospect If I was a bit more sober I could have pulled some moves on him to kiss him, using the cigarette as a decoy. Luckily I was out of my mind. \n\nHis eyes pierced into mine an eyebrow raised. I took stock of myself again. My skirt had ridden up past my thigh, and my hands were wet from landing on a puddle. My shirt hung low on me, exposing my flesh to the night air. Home seemed miles away.\n\nAs I contemplated sleeping where I was, he answered me coolly. \"Deal.\"\n\nI looked up at him groggily his hand extended towards me again.\n\n I took it.\n\nHe puffed the cigarette gently, then shared it with me. Greedily I puffed in a huge gust of smoke letting it fill my lungs and my head. I closed my eyes to enjoy it. God that was good. I felt the rush of blood and nicotine fill me.\n\nAs I regained some sort of consciousness, I pulled the cigarette from my lips only to let it fall into a small puddle. \n\nAutomatically I crushed it with my heel.\n\nI quickly glanced up at him, my thought muddled. His hand had reached expectantly to grab it but it was too late.\n\n \"Guess I won\" I said, with some chagrin.\n\nHis nostrils flared dangerously. Then he turned and walked away.\n\n\"Hey, where you goin?\" I tried to follow him, but my steps felt heavy. \n\n\"You won.\" he called out. \"You.. have my soul.\"\n\nSuddenly people started appearing. He was fading into a crowd. \n\n\"Wait!\" I called after him lunging forward. \n\nCold hands grabbed me, pulling me onward. Confused I stared into the hands that appeared out of thin air. Except they weren't normal hands. They were dark, darker than the night... and clawed. I screamed as i tried to make sense of what I was seeing. \n\nPanicked I closed my eyes and tried to push them away as they forced me down to the ground. I fought against them, piercing the night with my scream. \"Somebody ! Help ! \"\n\nThey managed to get me flat against the floor but the clawed shadows continued to pull at my body pulled me further.\n\nThe ground began to disappear below me. I closed my eyes as the ground swallowed me whole. \n\nSuddenly it stopped.\n\n I was no longer being pulled anywhere.\n\n I tentatively opened my eyes. \n\nI was in my apartment. \n\nExcept I wasn't alone.\n\nIn the shadows I could see the creatures that had been grabbing me twisting and turning in what appeared to be agony filling my walls like some sort of macabre wallpaper. I could feel their evil eyes on me. \n\nThey were waiting. \nI screamed.\n\n \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403355113","downs":0,"edited":"1403355395","gilded":0,"id":"cid9hht","link_id":"t3_28ounj","name":"t1_cid9hht","parent_id":"t3_28ounj","retrieved_on":1434337541,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"Fionnlagh","body":"Gor lived in relative peace in a relatively quiet village, though his life was not ideal. \"Live in a single place!\" They had said. \"This grass makes food, and we can harvest it without having to move, as long as we plant more!\" Well, after years of what the village prophet called \"farming,\" Gor had enough. He lived with his mate and three offspring, and worked every day to feed everyone. He traded some of his grass food for skins and furs the hunters brought in, and after the harvest they always had a big feast. \n\nIt was the last full moon before the harvest when Gor started noticing something strange in his fields. His grass was bent, in weird shapes, but not broken. And every night he heard strange voices. He brought out a torch with him at night, but still he saw nothing. But every night, sure as the sun rising, he heard voices. One night, when he was inspecting a portion of his field nearest the forest, he looked out and was immediately blinded. Light, as if from the sun, shone through the trees and scared Gor until he shook, but he held his ground. He didn't know what caused him to walk toward the lights, but he found his feet moving anyway. One in front of the other, step by step, until Gor realized he was running into the forest. The lights called to him, and he couldn't do anything except answer.\n\nGor ran until he reached a clearing, where he saw the strangest object. It large, and shiny, like the rocks in the nearby mountains where he had come from. The lights shone out from a hole in the shiny surface, so bright Gor had to cover his eyes to be able to see anything. All across the surface of the shiny object lights of different color shone; some blue like the lake on a sunny day, some green like the grass in the field. But some were a color Gor had never seen; he was curious, but also afraid, so he stood back. When he finally regained control of his legs, his first instinct was to run, to run and never look back. But his interest in the shiny object made him stay. \n\nGor stood there, staring at the lights on the shiny object until he saw shadows forming in the hole. The light from the hole was being blocked, and it looked familiar. The shape looked like it had two arms and two legs, just like he did. Only when the shadow grew until it took solid form did Gor truly understand. They were creatures, much like him, only smaller. They had weak looking arms and legs, terrible for hunting, and were too short to reach tree limbs, which meant that they didn't forage much either. Gor decided that they must be farmers like him, only they didn't look strong enough for that, either. One of them opened their mouths, and strange sounds came out. They sounded to Gor like words, just not the words he was used to hearing. The nearest one looked right at Gor and stared for a while, not knowing what to make of him. Gor was frightened, worried that they might overpower him, but they were small looking and weak, so there wasn't much chance of that. Then the first one pointed at Gor and opened it's mouth, and the sounds came out again, this time directed at him. He waved his hands and pointed at his ears, hoping they would understand that he didn't know what they were saying. He spoke up, but his limited speech sounded like broken sentences to them. After a few minutes of attempted conversation, the first creature threw up his arms in a sign of defeat, then pulled something out of his clothes. It looked like the big thing, only smaller, and he pointed it at Gor, who stood there, wondering what would happen. The last thing he remembered was one of them uttering the sound \"Poor chap. Lost his hearing, I bet. Now, which way back to London?\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403513495","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ciepkg3","link_id":"t3_28uscf","name":"t1_ciepkg3","parent_id":"t3_28uscf","retrieved_on":1434362774,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Come over here, we have to get going”  Ani stood up slowly, and with her head down, she walked towards the man.  They pushed passed the swinging doors of the ER and into a room in the far back.  There was blood on the floor and people in lab coats were shouting.\n\n“I don’t like this dad, can we just go home?” asked Ani, she was pulling on his jacket.\n\n“Not yet honey, this man is about to go on a trip he’s been getting ready for his whole life.  We have to make sure he finds his way”  He did his best to explain it, but he knew he wasn’t getting very far.  He wished he could capture Ani’s attention, explain the importance of what he does.  He wanted to make her proud, but he had his job.  This man needed him more than Ani did right now.\n\nAs the doctors pushed hard on the old man’s chest, the man in black placed a single hand on his head.

A few more minutes passed and the two men began acting like old friends.  The man in black turned to where Ani was standing and noticed she was no longer there.\n\n“She missed it…” he muttered, looking slightly disappointed.  The two walked out of the room as the doctors took off their gloves.  The man in black apologized as he looked in each room they passed.

Try to be more careful next time!*\n\nI don't know who thought that cheerful message was a good idea.  I was *dead*.  Or a copy of me was, at least.  Treat it with a little dignity, would you?  I step out of the cloning vat and start following the usual post-revival checks.  Senses, limbs, nervous system OK.  Cost of the clone was already deducted from my account.\n\nFirst things first, find out what happened since my last backup.  The last thing I remember is, of course, making my nightly upload before I went to bed.  I remember that the date was March 23, 2104.  I glance at the clock on the wall, which shows the full date and time for exactly this situation.  It is currently about a quarter past three, March *27th?*\n\nThat can't be right.  I can't have gone four days without a backup.  That would be like going four days without brushing your teeth.  Something had to have gone wrong.\n\n\"Computer, backup integrity test for the past four days.\"  I announce to the empty room.  If Brainwaves Unlimited managed to lose track of my #BADWORDS# *brain*, I'll sue their pants off.\n\nThe screen on the wall returns the scan results in a few seconds.  No more recent backups than the one in my head right now.  All checksums add up.  I speak a few more commands to bring up more detailed analysis.  Nothing.  Apparently, on the morning of March 24th, I just upped and decided not to make any more backups.\n\nWell, cursing Past Me's stupidity won't solve anything.  I open the locker next to the cloning vat, throw on my clothes, and step outside.  An actual human receptionist is there, thankfully.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Gibson.  Were you satisfied with your revival experience today?\"\n\n\"Past Me was an idiot.  I've lost the past four days.\"\n\nShe winces in sympathy.  \"Oh, that's terrible.  I lost a day once, and that was confusing enough.  Is there anything we can do for you?\"\n\n\"I think I'll have to get to my apartment and retrace my steps.  But do you know what triggered my revival?\"\n\nShe taps on her keyboard a few times, then turns her screen to show me.  \"Something killed you.  Med-chip reported catastrophic injury and destruction of brain.  You'll want a copy for the insurance company, I suppose?\"\n\nI nod.  \"Or the police, perhaps.  I'm not the sort of man who burns a clone on a weekend bender.\"\n\nI hand her my datapad, and it chimes as she transmits the records.  I swipe idly through them as I walk away.  Most of it is medical gibberish, tedious columns of numbers about my blood oxygen in the last 30 seconds of my life and so on.  But one of the columns is interrupted halfway through by a message in plain English.  I tap it and take a closer look.\n\n\"Hello, Future Me.  If you're reading this, you're probably wondering where the past few days went.  Sorry for not keeping backups, but if they thought for even a second that you remembered what happened, they'd have offed you and then wiped all your backups.  Yes, they even know about the one you hid in the CD case labeled \"Astley Videos.\"  They aren't playing around.\n\n\"Honestly, it's probably safest if you walk away from all this and try to pick up your life again.  But if you knew what I know, you wouldn't walk away either.  And besides, I'm not the sort of person who walks away from a good mystery, and that means you won't either.\n\n\"Right, I need to wrap this up, because I have an appointment with a nice man with a shotgun who wants to get all these secrets out of my brain.  I'm putting this on the med-chip, it should look like a normal revival request to them.  If you're as good as I think I am, this is all you need to pick up where I left off.\"\n\nThe medical data picks up again as if it had never left off.  I stare at the end of the message in shock for a few seconds.  Past Me was involved in something dangerous.  So dangerous that my own brain wasn't a safe place to hide it.  If I try to retrace my steps, I'll be stepping into the same mess he did.\n\nBut I have to find out, don't I?

Those four words have always came out of her mouth every time she took me out for air. She cares about me and I know if I were ever to get hurt it would break her heart. But my world wasn't the same as hers. The colorful universe that appears before her eyes are plain darkness for me. I have been a burden to my entire family ever since I entered this world and I've hated every single minute of my life because of one reason. I was born blind.\n\nEvery day is always trouble for me. Finding my way out of my room, tripping over clothes, and all sorts of stupid stuff that can all be avoided if I wasn't born like this. \n\n\"Damn it!\" I bit down on my lips as I smashed my toe into the sharp edge of the door. \n\n\"Hey are you alright?\" Mom asked while rushing to my aid. \n\n\"No! I'm not alright! Goddamn it I hate this! Why do I have to deal with all of this #BADWORDS#?\" I screamed with tears rushing down my cheeks. I pushed her aside and ran as fast as I could out of the house, knocking over things I couldn't see. \n\n\"Penny! Penny stop!\" My mother cried. But I was not slowing down. \n\nI ran as fast as I could out into the open fields outside of the house. I ran across the grass, tripped over rocks and stumbled over bushes until the strong smell of trees came rushing into my nose and I finally started to slow down my pace. \n\nI have never been to this part of the world before. I took one step, then another. Curiously scouting out the area through my working senses. I could hear pidgeys and taillows chirping ahead me, and I made my way towards the sound. \n\n\"Oh!\" I gasped as bumped into something. \n\n*Hello.* A voice echoed inside my head. \n\n\"Who? Who's that?\" Startled, I backed up slowly. \n\n*I am Kirlia, I mean no harm.* \n\n\"Kir-Kirlia? Are you a pokemon?\" Scared, I got back onto my feet and reached out ahead of me. A soft arm-like object reached back and held onto my hand. It was a gentle and relaxing touch. \n\n*I can see that you're angry and irritated.* \n\nShe can see that? \"Yes..Yes I'm not having such a good day.\" I answered, assuming the pokemon could understand me, \"I don't know if you can tell, but I have no vision, of anything! It's as if I live in a completely different world than everyone else and it has bugged me for all my life.\"\n\n*Maybe I can help, here come closer.* The soft voice echoed in my head as Kirlia held onto my hand and pulled me over.\n\n\"Help? What do you mean help?\" I let myself follow her through the darkness, hoping that the help she is offering can be somewhat life changing to me. \"Where are we going?\"\n\n*Just right ahead.* We stopped after walking for a few minutes. Surprisingly, I didn't run into or trip over anything while at it. *I may not be able to cure that curse of yours but I might be able to help ease the pain that it's causing you.* Kirlia spun me around and placed what I think are her arms onto my head. *Now, just breath in and out.*\n\nI followed her instructions and took a deep breath in, and let it out. Again and again, nothing seemed to be happening. I was just about to question her doings when suddenly, this sharp and piercing thing sparked in front of me. I could feel a sharp pain in my eyes and I screamed out in pain. But something was different. I moved my head up and noticed that the darkness was gone. And in its place were these objects, long and furry at the top. My jaw dropped to my stomach as I turned around and looked into the eyes of this miraculous being. \"Oh my Ho-oh, is this...did you...\" I couldn't find the right words to let out.\n\n*I have given you what you've hoped for, but it's only temporary because my powers are not strong enough to cure you.* The calming voice in my head matched to the pokemon in front of me. *The forest is no place for me to be. Allow me to go home with you and give you all the help I can.*\n\nA huge smile came across my tear-ed up face as I leaned towards her for a hug. \"Thank you. Thank you for all of this, for making my life meaningful again and for giving me hope.\" I looked back around and the darkness slowly appeared again. Her power must have been drained from this. \"Yes, come home with me! I need you and I will never be able to repay you for what you've brought into my life.\" I blindly reached out in front of my and held onto Kirlia. Slowly, she turned me around and guided me home.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403673200","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ciggj47","link_id":"t3_290wur","name":"t1_ciggj47","parent_id":"t3_290wur","retrieved_on":1434392988,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":10}
{"archived":true,"author":"GunNNife","body":"The kindergarten teacher pinned the flailing little girl to the floor.  Caroline Schumacher outweighed the six-year-old by more than a hundred and fifty pounds, but she could barely contain the mindless ball of fury.  Raina was a bright, playful student, with pretty brown hair and a quick smile.  Except she was completely unrecognizable now.  Her eyes were wide and unfocused; her hands shot in every direction, clawing the air.  Spittle spewed from her barking mouth.  Her body convulsed so hard that Caroline thought Raina was going to break her own back.\n\nMoments earlier Raina had frozen in place.  Caroline had assumed she was having some form of seizure; it would not be the first time a student had suffered one in her classroom.  But then Raina had jumped at Jason, a five-year old boy, and hit him with her windmilling fists.  That was when Caroline grabbed Raina and, unable to restrain the girl, held her on the ground.\n\nRaking fingernails clawed at Caroline's face.  The teacher could not catch her breath, the struggle was so difficult.  \"Get Mr. Murray,\" she gasped at her students.  \"Someone, go get him!\"\n\nRaina had to be restrained until paramedics arrived and rushed her to the hospital.  There she was sedated by permission of her terrified parents.  A shaken Mrs. Schumacher was treated for scratches to her face and was given the rest of the day off.\n\nThe next day, three more kindergarteners in the school attacked others in a frenzy.\n\nThe school was shut down as investigators searched for what chemical, pathogen, or radioactive material could be to blame.  The cause of the sickness would be found within a year; but still, it was seven years too late to save anybody.\n\n---\n\nAt first no one realized that the separate instances throughout the world were part of a pattern.  But by the end of the month there were children going crazy in every country.  All the victims were children born after April 13th, 2008.  All went into an attacking frenzy, followed by a catatonic state.  None of the victims recovered and had to be kept on various life-support machines.\n\nOn October 25th, 2014, Caroline Schumacher restrained the first victim in her school.  She was stabbed to death by a grieving mother five weeks later.  The act of violence was no longer unusual as humanity tore itself apart.\n\n---\n\nOn April 12th, 2008, a small chemical plant in eastern Indiana exploded.  Fears of dangerous chemical exposure were put to rest.  However, there was one frighteningly simple chemical combination that, vaporized, made it into the atmosphere and spread throughout the world.  It was simple and missed by all physicians, having no visible affect.  But it permeated the environment and, later tests showed, infected every human on the planet.  The chemical caused an invisible change that only became obvious in 2014.  Every child conceived since the chemical spread had a defect in the brain that manifested in their fifth or sixth year; a defect that causes berserk behavior and catatonia.  And even after scientists discovered the root of the problem, there was no way to fix it--humans could no longer produce children that would function into adulthood.\n\nThe time of turmoil had begun.  And in less than a century, the songs of humanity rang their last notes, and there was only silence.\n\n**EDIT:**  Explained the problem a little better.  Minor grammar and style changes as well.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403715157","downs":0,"edited":"1403844564","gilded":0,"id":"cigsn1h","link_id":"t3_29246s","name":"t1_cigsn1h","parent_id":"t3_29246s","retrieved_on":1434398829,"score":44,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":44}

This is bad. This is bad. And yet I’m still a stony mess of immovable man. Some part of me recognizes a change of tempo in the music and suddenly she’s lost in the crowd again and I’m #BADWORDS# from my stupor. \n\nIt’s midnight and we’re younger. “Come on!” She laughs, pulling at my hand. “Let’s go!” I let myself be corralled into her jeep and suddenly we’re off. It doesn’t matter where and never did. Every day that summer, and every night, a new adventure. She drove fast and mocked my wide eyes. “Make a wish!” She’d always say. “The streetlamps look like shooting stars, don’t they? Make a wish for the both of us.” It was always the same wish, though she didn’t know it. I wished for her. I wished we’d never grow old. \nBut wishes are only dreams without the strength of determination. \n\nI pushed through the crowd, the memories glistened in my eyes. \n\nThe summer ended and she returned to her world, and I mine. I’d look over my books and see her laughing- surrounded, as she always was, by an adoring crowd. Sometimes, she’d catch my eye and smile and I couldn’t help but wish for courage. But without her, the streetlights never moved fast enough to be shooting stars so my wish was never granted. \n\nI couldn’t find her. She had melted away. Again. \n\nThe four years flew and every summer it was the same and come fall it would end just as abruptly as it began. “We’re spots and stripes, you and I.” Spots and stripes only match during crazy summers. That last year I knew it was the last and I knew she would fly when they cut the strings holding her down. So I stole my courage- the strength I’d been saving up from my books- and I asked her. “Friday night? I know it’s not summer but car rides are just as beautiful in January.” And she shocked me with a yes. \n\nI felt the panic again. I had lost her, like I lost her before and I’d never find her.

We drove so fast and the streetlights were wishes again. The night didn’t end when the stars came out and I awoke by her beautiful side. But sunlight brought back reality and when summer came she flew, as all wild things must. I never saw her again. \n\nUntil now and I let her go again. I couldn’t get myself to move in time to approach her. No wonder she wanted to leave, I was an idiot. I stood still once again, letting my worries tumble around in my head to the beat of the music.

I knew she was cold, she was always cold, on all days not considered summer. She rested her head against my shoulder, seemingly lost in thought. I felt my body naturally press against hers, like a magnet, god, the attraction was unreal.\n\n\"We were on the train, and it was snowing outside. Streetlamps flashed by like shooting stars and I told you to make a wish,\" I whispered quietly, into her ear.\n\n\"New Year's Eve.\", she said, and tightened the scarf around her neck. We stood beneath a lone streetlamp, bathing in its comfortable yellow glow, and the leaves were falling around us even by a gentle touch of the wind. She continued, \"It came true the day you asked me to marry me,\",her voice wavering slightly. I smiled measly, and made sure to soak up as much from the moment here in time as I could.\n\n\"What I said in my vows was true. I will love you until the day I'm gone. But you'll..\" I hesitated, choking on the words. \"You'll have to move on,\"\n\n\"Brian, please...\"\n\n\"I want, no, I *need* you to *promise* me you'll move on. Don't let me haunt you. Just be grateful for the time we had.\" \n\nShe became silent, but I could hear the occasional suppressed sob come through. She turned around and put a hand on my cheek, tilted her head and frowned her brows. So beautiful. Her freckles, and bright brown eyes, tiny nose and chestnut hair covering her face slightly. Just looking at her was intoxicating. She kissed me, lovingly, and made sure to linger in the moment for as long as possible, as it could be our last.\n\n#BADWORDS# cancer.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403759485","downs":0,"edited":"1403760017","gilded":0,"id":"cihcvuz","link_id":"t3_294gla","name":"t1_cihcvuz","parent_id":"t3_294gla","retrieved_on":1434408565,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

Only the roughest and craftiest souls can make it from Hell, through Purgatory and those who do reach the golden walls are met by one of the baddest archangels in the golden city. \n\n*Look out souls an angel is comin' for you. Ch-check your spirit, it's too late to pray, no devil guna make it this way.*\n\nCamael, archangel,white-robed, four wing cherub designed by god, popped on a pair of aviators and lifted his ten foot flaming sword into the air saying, \"They call this Soul Ripper.\" After three strong swings, he began pacing along the gilt gold gate between heaven and purgatory.\n\n\"It takes a real piece of trash,\" Cameal said, \"to get out of hell. Sometimes, some of them heavenly ladies get bored out of their #BADWORDS# and decide to play, 'Yahweh my light shines for thee, gracious creator and divinity.' Sorry, rules, every time we say his name, we must ring out hosanna. Chicks be playing the big guy. They help a soul get out of hell and then, get tired of him when he is wandering around down there.\"\n\nCamael's eyes lit up and springing into action, he opened his wings and turned his sword blue fire. Flying over the gate, he swept down upon an exhausted soul that had finally reached the firm ground of heaven. \"Oh thank Go--\" the soul cried in relief, as Camael struck his back with full force screaming, \"By God's decree, you must remain in hell until the hallowing!\"\n\nThe soul was cast down through the firmament. **Waa Waa* \n\n\"They don't know who they playing with,\" Camael said relaxing his wings. \"You cut down like a thousand 'withers' a day, that's what we call gate jumpers. Nah, I don't have any respect for them. You live a sinful life, you pay the price. You don't follow Gods--blessed be he who formed the void, vibrant life and nullified, the darkness forev'--his plan, you live with the demons.\"\n\nA rather large group of souls crept though the mists bellow the gate. One whispered, \"Richie, you have to take the bullet.\"\n\n\"Why me?\"\n\n\"'cause you died trying to steal a 10 year old kid's bike.\"\n\nSoul Richie jumped up and ran quickly along the gold wall crying, \"You aint got nothing on me! You aint got nothing on me.\"\n\nCamael took to the air, sword ablaze; when he flew beyond the hidden group of souls, they clung to the wall as aether and slipped smooth along the clean surface. Camael stabbed Richie in the back. Turning around, seeing fifteen souls stealing into heaven, Camael took off his aviators and grinned, \"''Bout time we get heavenly up in this--fire be judged as punishment, for souls proven dissident!\" and from the sky, large brimstone hailed down upon the souls, bashing and smashing their essence out of heaven.\n\nCaelum ran the hem of his robe along the wall and smiled, \"Just another day on the south-gate.\"\n\n**edit**","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1403926915","downs":0,"edited":"1403927223","gilded":0,"id":"cij2pkc","link_id":"t3_299r1l","name":"t1_cij2pkc","parent_id":"t3_299r1l","retrieved_on":1434439249,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

I pushed passed the officers, and sprinted towards the unrecognizable heap. Despite it being a terrible, mangled mess, I knew what it was, and what had happened. My wife had said so many times how nervous she was driving on the highway with our daughter in the car with her. I had brushed it off, trying to convince her that she had nothing to worry about.\n\nWhen I reached the ruined mass of my wife’s car, the firefighters tried desperately to keep me back. They tried to explain what had happened, but I wouldn’t be sated with just their words. Even though I knew exactly what the wreck before me meant, I had to see; my mind still wouldn’t let me believe any of this was real until I saw for myself. Begrudgingly they relented, and I stepped forward to the wreck.\n\nThey were gone. The entire car had burnt with an immense ferocity, and there was nothing left but ash and scorched steel. I fell to my knees, my hands gripped on the still warm metal as I felt the terrible anger building inside me. I should have gone to pick up my daughter from daycare. My wife had been nervous about the highway, and I should have listened to her. \n\nBut I didn’t. I thought I needed to work late. And my wife’s car was hit by some careless person, and had caught fire. My wife and daughter burnt to death, trapped in a failed haven. My wife died desperate to save her child. My daughter died screaming for her mom.

She raised her head up slowly facing the sky and her body followed, raising herself slowly into a slightly hunched u#BADWORDS#ht stance, her shoulders still heavy and her breathing becoming increasing deeper yet slow and steady. Her breath turning into misty fog from the piercing cold which crept up an enveloped her.\n\n A fog like shadow appeared. It stood tall and menacing, seemingly stretched over her.

Now, A long tattered black cloak that ran down and spewed out over the floor, reaching and stretching over and into all space like a virus, a tall but drooped hood adorned by a thick crown of twisted and charred black thorns, some caught in the fabric of the hood. Long bone fingers emerged from under the sea of fabric and reached out from under the cloth and pointed towards the floor, the cloth hung long and weighted from the ivory bones. She knew what 'he' was referring too.\n\n   Her eyes rolled slowly down following the creases and crevices of the fabric and down onto the floor beside 'him,' her gaze glided over the horror she had committed, but she quickly turned away in shame. She looked back up to him searching in the void of shadows under the hood for a face. Her eyes were wide and pleading. She knew 'he' would leave, she would be alone again. She did not want him to take the 'other' in his arms, and hold them close in his embrace. She wanted his caress, his touch, his kiss. Her eyes tightened, holding the tears back, not allowing them to break. Once her eyes opened, she was back in reality. No white, no dense cold, just her and the 'other'. He was gone. She prepared herself to leave and go out into the night, what would she do to see him again? Who would suffer for her?

The confusion hurts my brain and now dying seems imminent. He slams his fist into my face and grabs my shirt to pull me into two more brutal hits. My life is over.

One the rank of different forms of government its barley above dictatorship. Can anybody tell the class why? Beside what I just said.’ Mr Lee looked over the class; they were actually interested in what he said today.  Fong I raised her hand and he gave her a nod to speak up ‘because the masses are stupid?’ \n‘What do you mean by that?’ She was on the right track and she was not deterrent by his question. \n‘People in large group tend to follow each other and not think threw what they are doing. It’s the herd mentality. If you can get enough people to follow you then they won’t think too much about what you’re saying. They just want to belong’\n‘Yes that’s correct, but there is so much more then just the herd mentality of us humans. Yes Carl?’\nCarl was from a rich family, probably the riches in class.  But he was also among the smartest. ‘Because its easier to make people follow you if you have the resources. You end up people voting against what’s good for them just because somebody with resources has lured them into their “herd”’\n‘ yeah and let’s not forget greed. It’s natural for people to want more of what they have. Resources if you like. “ Tihin interrupted “ so the people with resources used their power to get elected and with the power they received  as elected represented  they gained more power. They get trapped in their own greed’\n‘ That is correct Tihin, but please raise your hand next time.’ Tihin just grinned. ‘ But as they said. We have the herd mentality, and we got the greed or lust for power. As democracy evolved it became very clear that only the rich and powerful would be able to hold power. And they usually used the power to gain more. And that is the problem with democracy. With democracy you always get capitalism, which then lead to the rich removing any rules and regulation on the market. And then.. well we get to the mess of 21th century.  To think that we had to go back in time and invoke the use of kings and queens to fix the mess.   Royalty might not be the best system in the history but its sure beats democracy.’\n‘Why?  I mean we still got a few rich making all the decisions. We still get to vote for prime minister.  We just don’t get to choose the candidates any more. Isn’t this just a dictatorship in disguise? ‘ Carlos  was clearly not sold on the idea of the current form of government. \nMr Lee smiled ‘All form of government is a form of dictatorship. Or will lead to it in some form, But our rich and powerful have to fear our king and his crown prince.  Because they are trained from childhood to see threw their lies.  We know that the crownprince now is of school age. We don’t know what school he attends but he could be sitting in this very room. Learning what it is to be just a commoner.  His father our king lived a year as a beggar in Rome. When he took power he removed all his support from the catholic church seized all their funds and set up the out of poverty program. Our kings have learned from the past, they have learned that they must be somebody who can be in control, somebody who can think and has the power to act.   Somebody who knows what its like to be part of all the different social groups’\nCarlos just looked at him Mr Lee wanted to continue but the class ended and the kids ran out.  \n\n\nCarlos opened the door to the kitchen and snuck to the fridge to steal some ice cream before dinner and he almost made it to before he heard the sound of his father softly clearing his throat. ‘How was school today?’  \n\n‘it was okay’ He opened the fridge and grabbed the ice cream. ‘The teacher told me you spend a year as a beggar in Rome.

{"archived":true,"author":"itbedatguy","body":"The rain had been falling more than it ever had before that morning. I knew that despite this, I still had to roll out of my bed, frizzy hair and all, and get going to the office. \n\n\"The office...\" I drearily thought, before realizing the time; 4:15, a quarter hour past what I should normally be awake at, was staring me in the face, the light of the LEDs temporarily blinding me.\n\nI quickly threw one leg out from underneath the warmth of my sheets, the cold scrambling to find sanctuary on my exposed limb. Without a moment able to spare, I forced the rest of my body to follow the leg out of the sheets and across the room quickly to the closet. Throwing on what I assumed was a coherent outfit, torn blue jeans with a sweater and my brown leather jacket that seemed determined to look more like a dress by its length over it, I made my way out the door and into my car.\n\nThe rain continued its torrential downpour, with the windshield becoming a smorgasbord of various types of dirty street-side ice and water. After gazing at the trees struggling to stay u#BADWORDS#ht in the relentless wind, I noticed I was about ten over the speed limit, but that was mild for what I usually would be going if I were this far behind on my morning schedule.\n\nBut as the road continued to become shorter and shorter, the fog creeping inward slowly toward the car, the headlights struggling to see ahead; a blaring noise came from the left of me. In the next moment, everything became a blur. Screeching. Impact. Car spinning. Headlights flickering. Glass shattering. Darkness.\n\n\nI suddenly awoke, screaming out to the dark room I had just been in not thirty minutes ago; rain pounding on the windows, alarm clock unable to tell me I forgot to set it. Dazed, I looked around; clueless as to what just occurred. Assuming what I had just experienced was a dream, it acted as so; the memories from it slowly vanished as I tried to hold onto them, the only thing remaining being the sound of tires straining then complete silence.\n\nI continued about my quick-paced morning, unable to dwell on the strikingly realistic dream; throwing on an ordinary outfit with what looked like a dress of brown leather, and rushing toward the door. Although since I had been so tired from what seemed like me experiencing an alternate reality, I opted to wait a few more minutes as I made myself coffee. I took a sip, the caffeine quickly finding its way into my veins and flooding my mind with a slow, but building energy, and moved toward the door and out, holding the hood of the leather dress jacket over my head as the rain fought to find my skin.\n\nI went the normal ten over, continuing about my morning normally, though I eventually found myself trailing another vehicle going about my speed; an odd occurrence, considering it wasn't normal for people to be up so early, though here I was, trying to prevent spilling coffee amidst the pouring rain outside.\n\nThat's when the memories came flooding back. Coffee cup falling. Breaking. Screeching. Impact. Glass shattering. Light.\n\nI looked up, tears forming in my eyes as I expected to be dead; instead I saw the car ahead of me; a crumpled heap of metal on its side. An eight wheeler sat stationary to the left of it, with its front pushed inward on itself. A man hurriedly hopped down from the cab as I sat there unable to comprehend what happened, what was happening... what was supposed to happen. \n\nWhen the paramedics came, I was still sitting there; a state of shock having washed over me like a wave I was unable to swim out of. They asked questions of the man who had hit the car as the body bag was zipped up and rolled away. No chance. No chance to survive. I was there. I know. Then a woman spoke to me.\n\n\"You were here when the crash happened, right?\" she asked, to which I simply nodded. \"Well, the body was unable to be identified on site. Do you perhaps know who was supposed to be in the car?\" she continued, but I remained silent as I tried to find any words to give in return.\n\nBut all I could do was look forward, slowly blink a few times... my eyelids starting to feel heavier... until finally looking back to the woman's hopeful eyes, allowing a single word to fall from my lips.\n\n\"Me.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1404411431","downs":0,"edited":"1404413316","gilded":0,"id":"cinqiij","link_id":"t3_29qr80","name":"t1_cinqiij","parent_id":"t3_29qr80","retrieved_on":1434536087,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":8}
{"archived":true,"author":"mnemoniac","body":"Commander Janice Ray looked up from the report to her CO, captain Ramirez Ondi, \"This... this is confirmed?\"\n\nHe nodded, \"The infiltration teams failed.  The weapon was fired.  Its target is Ander Prime.\"\n\nHer thoughts whirled from helpless rage and blank incomprehension to despondence, \"I never believed they'd use it.\"\n\nHe nodded, his features composed.  She wondered how he did that, but it was a passing thought, a brief distraction from the yawning horror.  After a few moments captain Ondi spoke and she welcomed the interruption to her thoughts, \"They didn't know we were in system.  Still don't, and they just used their ace in the hole.\"\n\nHer eyes flickered to the captain but before she spoke she paused to give thought to his words.  Without their sword of damocles they couldn't threaten anyone anymore, the war would be over shortly and the damned Vord would be sc#BADWORDS# from the universe.  He was right about that, but why would the *Day Break*'s presence in system matter?  \"You mean us to intercept it.\"\n\nHe nodded, \"We're the only ship in the sector that might be able to manage it.\"\n\nShe thought back to the skirmish that had caused them to come here.  The unexpectedly heavy damage and the long diagnostics to track down the faulty components.  The difficult and time-consuming replacement that had held them in the Ander system for the last two months.  They were still in the shakedown flights to test the repairs, and so had a significant number of extra diagnostic and repair personnel on board.  \"When do we leave?\"\n\n\"Immediately.  I will address the crew while you plot the course and get us started.  There is no time to waste and we have little enough chance as it is.\"\n\nShe nodded, purposeful again, \"Yes sir.\"  She turned and left his room for the bridge.  He arrived shortly after she did, and there was plenty of curiosity from the bridge crew about the new course she'd ordered.\n\nHe sat in the command chair, composed himself, and keyed the comm for a shipboard message, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, our objective here has changed dramatically.  The Vord have fired their phase missile.  We've been able to discover their target: Ander Prime.\"  He paused to let that sink in, \"This isn't the death sentence we thought, however, the *Day Break* can stop the missile.  The only way to stop the missile is to force an early detonation.  To destroy it.  We are now making best speed for as early an interception as possible.  All personnel not essential for this mission will be escorted to escape pods and outboard ships.  There's a great deal of work to be done, lets get to it.\"\n\nMost of the repair personnel fled the ship on orders, leaving the *Day Break* with no remaining small craft, before she entered hyper.  Usually interceptions in hyper are extremely difficult to achieve.  Missing your target, or zipping past it were all too easy, and the difficulty of detecting a ship in hyper usually meant it was impossible to attempt, and if you missed your target you'd never find it again.  However, the phase missile was, apparently, a different beast.  No one outside the Vord really understood how the damn thing operated, but it was like a beacon in hyper.  More than a week out and the *Day Break* already knew where it was.  Interception would be easy.  While actually destroying it would be beyond almost any ship in the fleet, the *Day Break* was the newest and most powerful ship in the fleet, and by extension, the known galaxy.  The destructive and defensive power of the craft was almost literally beyond the comprehension of most sophont creatures.  The phase missile was the only mobile thing whose destructive potential was greater.  Everyone aboard knew that getting close enough to destroy it would doom even the *Day Break*, and using the small craft to evacuate the noncombat personnel left the ship without the capacity for everyone to escape.\n\nWhen they left Ander, Janice would never have guessed that who lived and died would have been their biggest concern.  The Captain was putting together a list of personnel that had to stay, his name was on it, but there weren't enough pods for everyone.  It wasn't a design flaw, the things were only designed to be used in emergency situations and had to be located close to the outer hull to be useful.  There was simply a limit on how many people would have time to get to escape pods in a combat scenario, one everyone had accepted, and no designer had every really imagined a situation where full evacuation would be needed without the aid of a ship's small craft.\n\nThe ship was full of clever people, and they'd all done the math.  Just a bit over fifty percent of the crew could survive, and less than twenty percent was necessary for the final attack run.  That left most of the crew, hundreds of people, not knowing if they'd live or die, and a lot of them were doing everything they could to make sure their names weren't on the Captain's list.  The Captain, however, wasn't paying attention to last ditch efforts.  He was reviewing efficiency reports, looking at the quality of people, and Janice was helping.  They were trying to make sure that the best people survived, which was subjective as hell, but they were the only ones to judge.\n\nWhen the ship dropped out of hyper and jettisoned the escape pods with the hyperspace beacon, there were a lot of unhappy people left on the ship.  Their actions in the days before the final run ran the gamut.  Some fought, some #BADWORDS#, some withdrew, but none of them shirked their duties.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1404414459","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cins27o","link_id":"t3_29r9o4","name":"t1_cins27o","parent_id":"t3_29r9o4","retrieved_on":1434536617,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

For the thousandth time, the doctors said it's the end of the road.\"\nClint Eastwood threw his poncho over his left shoulder abruptly and re-lit his cigarillo. \"The doctors eh?

The long gravel drive. The deep still pond. The images immediately soothed him. \"Just focus on us Chad. They are being hard on you for your own good.

Suddenly The Sargent slammed his arm down to the mattress. \"Don't even think about it you slippery #BADWORDS#.\" He whispered in Chad's ear. Chad winced and tried again, but the Sargent's grip only tightened.\nLiv wiped her eyes. \"Look at it honey. She did a great job.\" \nCarol stepped in front of her, hand on hips, accentuating her well-pressed pantsuit. \"Don't even look at this #BADWORDS# Chadwick.

Carol jumped forward and lifted his face to the ceiling. They struggled until The Sargent pitched in, holding it in place. Clint Eastwood's spurs rattled as he pinned Chads arm down with a knee.\n\"Chad take her picture. She worked so hard.\"\n\"Don't listen to that #BADWORDS# Chad.

{"archived":true,"author":"pietya","body":"&gt;\"Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\" \n\nBegan the weathered old man. His gray hair nearly combed to the right side, just above his closed wrinkled eyes and tired brow. He kneeled by his small bed, neatly made every morning after waking up. The one room apartment was a shadow of what he used to have, a family and a home.\n\n&gt;\"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.\"\n\nPictures of his wife and son were nearly pinned on the wall above his bed. All of them weathered by the sun, wind and time. A neat timeline could be recognized from the pattern of the pictures, first the son got taller, lost his boyhood and became a man. Then his wife began withering away, like a beautiful flower, picture by picture loosing her health, until there was only him and his son. \n\n&gt;\"Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.\"\n\nHe and his son became closer after the death of the woman who brought them together. First there was denial of the death that moved that away from reality. Then anger that burned their soul to ash. Then the bargaining with its chorus of \"should have, could have and would haves\". Finally depression soaked in rum, whiskey and tears. Finally acceptance, the quiet moment at the tombstone where the son and father understood each other more than in their 25 years as a family.  \n\n&gt;\"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\"\n\nThen came the few years where the father and son would talk with each other, spend time with one another. He became a teacher to the son who wanted to make his own family. They shared stories, father about his young life, his love, anger, frustration. He told his son to love each moment, because there are only so few moments in life. \n\n&gt;\"Dear father, I do not know what you mean to do. You took my wife, you took my sanity and now you took my son. Lord works in mysterious ways said Father Torgerson. But in what way are you leading me? Why do you take so much and now give me this blessing.\"\n\nIt was a quick death, the doctor said that he didn't suffer, that he passed away in his sleep as the blood clot in his brain slowly dimmed the light of his life away. The only one left to suffer was the father. He was left listless. His mind drove him to the neighborhood bar where he met his bartender. He gave his first confession over a double whiskey on the altar of the bar. The alcohol soaked bar took in his tears like a sacrifice.\n\n&gt;\"Is this supposed to be recompense for my wife and son? Am I supposed to believe that this should make things even? Someone said 'You cannot conceive, nor can I, of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God.' Is this your mercy?\"\n\nHis vision blurred as he stumbled out into the dead of night. Flashes of streetlight filtered through the window of the taxi as he went home. He spent the dreamless night cradled in his lonely bed. Surrounded by the ghosts of the past his mind went into nothingness. \n\n&gt;\"Is this a blessing? Or are you mocking me.\"\n\nHe woke up from his restless sleep. The dry stale air of his small apartment weighed on him so much more. Like each day before, he stood up, made his bed and felt a hunger amplified by the feeling of emptiness in his gut. \n\nHe walked to the kitchen and made his usual breakfast of toast, butter and tea. All these movements were automatic, shaped, programmed and perfected over a long life. He looked at the dining table, where only a few days ago him and his son were chatting about life. He saw a lottery ticket, the same ticket he would buy every week, it was his wife's habit. Every week, friday afternoon she would always buy this lottery ticket from the store with her groceries. He continued it when she got sick, for her, and he continued it after she died, as a tradition, a small prayer to the spirits of luck that his wife prayed to each friday night. \n\n&gt;\"Out of all things. This? Lord are you trying me again? Am I to suffer more than Abraham at your hands? You spared his son and gave him your blessing. Is this what you mean by eternal love?\"\n\nThe ticket spelled out the numbers \"1 4 14 29 33 and 55\". The Powerball Lottery, he didn't know how much was at stake. He never hoped to win anything. Once in a while it was a dollar here, $5 there. He turned on the TV, not so much to pay attention to it but to make some noise and muddy the silence of the apartment. He began thinking about when to go to the hospital, when to call his son's friends about his death. All the phone calls he never hoped to repeat after his first funeral. \n\nThen as he began loosing himself in his thoughts, the announcer from the TV began saying a familiar string of numbers. Pulled away from the depth of his thoughts he turned towards the TV, beneath the overly made up face of the TV anchor was the same string of number as on the ticket he had lying on his dining table. \n\n\"1 4 14 29 33 and 55\"\n\nAnd right next to it a flashing blinking, obnoxious sign \"$143 million jackpot.\"\n\n&gt;\"Am I being #BADWORDS#d again? Jennifer, my love tell me, am I the Lord's fool? Is he toying my my heart?\"\n\nThe day went like a blur, between the bitterly familiar phone calls, he called his lawyer about his son's will, he called his banker to set up a new account to manage his new funds, and finally confirmed his ticket. The person from the lottery seemed surprised. In her many years of giving away millions, she never hear someone... so lonely, so tired, so dreary over winning millions of dollars. \n\nAfter the whirlwind of the day there he was. He hasn't prayed since he last visited his wife's grave. On his weary knees, he looked at the timeline of his family on the wall. the last picture, the most recent one was of his 52nd Birthday, his son took him out for a drink. There he was, smiling with his son both sitting at a table with empty pint glasses with their flush red cheeks. \n\n&gt;\"Eli take care of your mom. I don't know  what the Lord wants from me. Is this his mercy? Is this his apology for taking you away? Is he mocking me? Or his he trying me again. That I do not know. But I hope to make you two proud. I don't know what lays beyond this night, I will try my best to make you two proud. \n\n&gt;Lord. I will take what you give me. I do not know what you have in store. I do this not to praise your name, but to make my love ones proud of me. To prove to them that they loved someone who can bear the burdens of life. \n\n&gt;Amen.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1404763508","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ciqxerv","link_id":"t3_2a2dn4","name":"t1_ciqxerv","parent_id":"t3_2a2dn4","retrieved_on":1434597417,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

The man used to infiltrate under fake iden#BADWORDS#es corporations, religious cults and even neighborhoods where he would gain the trust of the people working around him and then, in a glimpse of an eye, detonate a bomb faking his death in the progress. But this time was different, he was not planning to fake his death on this assault but to actually end with his life, along with the lives of other 150 people, because he was simply….. bored, he never did it for the money nor the fame of an acclaimed serial killer, he was a nobody and wanted to stay that way, he just enjoyed to get people to trust him and then kill them just to prove how people are a bunch of animals that can’t and should never be trusted, he extracted joy of watching how mommy and little sussy had to attend the morge trying to identify the body of hard working daddy from a bunch of dismembered and rotting bodies, but…. he started to lose this satisfaction and decided to take his life, along with the passengers of the flight A7-212 boarding on gate number 8.\n\nAs the man proceeded to take his assigned seat he found himself sited next to a rather strange man resting his head in the window frame while wearing an old pair of sunglasses, the man decided to pay little attention to the stranger but then he said “Hi”, “Hello” answer the man, then while the man was about to silently wait for the plane to take off so he could take the many lives he was planning to, the stranger said “Amazing how beautiful the sun looks when you are up in the sky, isn’t it? ”, the man considered the stranger a little annoying but still, if he was to kill all these people he might as well get to know one of them for old times’ sake.\n-\t“Business or pleasure?”, said the man\n-\t“Pleasure you could say”, answered the stranger as without looking, extended his hand to greet the man, “The name is Santiago”\n-\t“You can call me Frank”\n-\t“Frank, I like the name, so tell me Sir, business of pleasure?”\n-\t“You could say a little of both” answered the man as he chuckled a little.\n-\t“Good to hear, so is something good waiting for you in Brazil?”\n-\t“Oh yes, you would be surprised, it will be a blast”, said the man as he started to enjoy how much of a fool this man was.\n-\t“That’s great, I have my brother waiting for me in the airport so we can go fulfill a long time dream of ours” said the stranger with a big smile \n-\t“That’s great, would you mind sharing your dream” \n-\t“I would be happy to, since little me and my brother have been very close and soccer fans but even though my brother could, I could never play the beautiful sport, so my brother would always stay by my side narrating what I couldn’t see so I could also be part of the game” said the stranger as he took out his sunglasses to clean his tears reveling a pair shut eyes. “Many years ago he promised me he would make it big as a narrator and that I would be sitting next to him in his first world cup match, while listening how he does what he likes the most….. narrate soccer matches to his little blind brother”\n\nA full body chill invaded the man’s whole body as he was about to detonate the bomb with this little trigger he kept under his jacket, “That’s an amazing story, I can believe you are on your way to fulfill your dream” he said, and as the stranger continued talking non-stop the man with the biggest smile he had ever had made himself comfortable in the tinny low cost airline seat, putted his hands behind his head, and while rolling a few tears down his cheek thought how amazing it was the love the strangers brother had for him……\n\nAnd how he was going to strip this happiness by leaving the dismember body of the blind man in the doorstep of the brother next morning. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1404769772","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cir0ovm","link_id":"t3_2a1phq","name":"t1_cir0ovm","parent_id":"t3_2a1phq","retrieved_on":1434598847,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}
{"archived":true,"author":"lf27","body":"*A 93 old man shouldn't be the first to enter a black hole*, was my first thought upon seeing the black hole in front of me. I signed up for the Exipo Program, a last ditch effort by NASA to rekindle love for space and return funding to their agenda, 67 years ago as a fit 26 year old, along with three other guys. We slingshotted around Jupiter and made it deeper into space than any other human, but over the years, it had lost it's thrill. There were only so many times you could look at the same issue of Playboy, after all.\n\n The oldest guy on the crew was Jack, a muscled 32 year old dark haired man, the American image of a hero. He was the captain of the ship, but, unfortunately, about halfway through the voyage, he was repairing some small holes on the ship's exterior and was hit just hard enough to poke a hole in his suit and depressurize it, making him the first death. \n\nThe next to die was Tom. He was a bit short for an astronaut, with brown hair and blue eyes, almost reminiscent of JFK. He was 31 when he signed up and a natural death got him at age 83, and then just Al and I were left.\n\nAl died just two weeks back, when a heart attack took him upon hearing how close they were, in a stroke of cosmic irony. Finding Al dead and moving him had been no easy task for a man near the end of his own life. And so his last weeks had been spent in solitude.\n\nA common thought I had in those two weeks was how bad of an idea this was. NASA's scientists had estimated a 70 year journey, so the amount of food alone was monumental. We had a small farm for oxygen and a sustainable food source, but we still needed some other food, just in case. With the extra large size of the shuttle, we used up most of the world's rocket fuel easily. We all knew this would take the rest of our lives, so we packed plenty of entertainment, plus many different exercise machines and things like that (though everyone stopped using those a few years in, since we all knew we would land again anyways), plus water to survive, producing an incredibly massive ship, almost making liftoff the 8th wonder of the world.\n\nFinally at the point of no return, I realized that Earth probably didn't even know that Jack, it's hero, with his crew, had died, leaving only one man behind, and I realized that I had no way to do#BADWORDS#ent this experience and send it back, making my entire life a waste of time. I cradled the last bottle of champagne, the one we should have shared as friends as a tear came slowly out of my eye. I read the year slowly, 2072, remembering the pride I had felt at our heroic departure, rubbing my thumb slowly over the year. I popped the cork and drank straight from the bottle, drowning my past, my life, in the allure of the aged alcohol, waiting until the final second of spaghettification. *Goodbye, dear friends*, I thought. *I've let you down.*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1404782319","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cir6mhn","link_id":"t3_2a1dur","name":"t1_cir6mhn","parent_id":"t3_2a1dur","retrieved_on":1434601643,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"kingofchairs","body":"The Traveler was the only human of his kind, and would soon be the only human to ever exist. This is in no way a credit to his talents or to the depth of mankind's ingenuity as a whole, but a credit to fate itself. The machine came to Earth concealed in a meteorite. Another society, in the depths of Andromeda, created the device. The inventor was a quadruped whose name is unpronounceable in any of the Earthly tongues. \n\nShe had started with what many humans would call \"baby steps.\" She only went back one week, as it was on her planet (the rough equivalent of 2 Earth weeks). For all her genius, she had not accounted for her own planet's revolution around its Sun. When the machine cooled down, it was floating in the same spot in which she had activated it, but the planet on which it sat had moved hundreds of miles along its ancient orbit, unknowing and uncaring of its lost passenger.\n\nThe machine was not airtight. She died within 2 seconds (approximately 4 Earth seconds). \n\nAnd so she drifted, mummified and encapsulated, out of the Andromeda galaxy and into its neighbor, so called the Milky Way by a small group of its less-developed inhabitants. The device landed in the house of our soon-to-be Traveler, a drunk who was hardly qualified to handle such a responsibility. \n\nStartled by the explosion and mourning the devastation of his home, the Traveler regarded the meteorite with a strange mixture of scorn and fascination. The self-#BADWORDS#led human beings had a tremendous respect for anything outside of their own planet, after all.\n\nOnce the object had cooled sufficiently, the Traveler poked and prodded at its surface, which crumbled away to reveal its true iden#BADWORDS#y: not as a meteorite, but as a machine covered in debris from its long journey. The machine was intelligently designed, but had since never been intelligently operated, and certainly never would be under the care of this new, inebriated human.\n\nAfter mustering almost all of his mental strength to open the door latch, the Traveler finally got his first look inside the chamber. He, and his neighbors behind him, marveled at the well-preserved corpse inside. It resembled a creature in Earth which they called \"dog,\" but possessed a frightening, almost human face. \n\nThe Traveler pulled the corpse out of the machine and let his neighbors surround it and gawk while he took its place. He shut and latched the door behind him. He never did like his neighbors. He was pleased to see that the machine glowed from within, with a near bioluminescent quality.\n\nHe pressed buttons and fiddled with whatever would move. This sent him far back, to before the Earth was even conceived. It was certainly not the beginning of time, but it was well before humans were around to count the sunsets. He died in 5.4 Earth seconds, beating the previous record. \n\nHe drifted far away from the young star which would soon give radiant light to eight planets. The machine landed on a different, much older planet in a neighboring solar system. The machine had been through quite a lot at this point, and this new, adolescent atmosphere greatly weakened its shielding. It disintegrated upon impact.\n\nThe surviving community of microbes, parasites, and bacteria which had previously lived happily inside our Traveler now spilled out of the destroyed machine and found purchase in this strange, new soil. These were the ancestors of the most destructive life forms in all of the Milky Way, a spider-like species of emotionless intellect who flew their way throughout the galaxy, mining resources and exterminating everything in their path.\n\nOne planet in their path was very young and had not yet developed its own life. This planet would have been called Earth. The creatures cracked the planet open, captured its core for use as fuel, and moved on. \n\nAnd so the Traveler secured his place as the only human being to ever exist, a dead husk spontaneously appearing in this new, tragic timeline, irreversibly removed from the timeline he called home. \n\nHuman beings would never come to be, thanks to the unwitting work of one dead human known only to me as the Traveler.\n\nIt is astonishing events like this that remind me why I made this Universe. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1404789757","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cira3ib","link_id":"t3_2a3vk1","name":"t1_cira3ib","parent_id":"t3_2a3vk1","retrieved_on":1434603476,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

I wish they'd hit me like they hit you.\" He laughed and the two high fived,\n\n\"We should get you home.\" The second spoke. \"Just in case more people start disappearing.\" They laughed again and we began filing out of the crowded area.\n\nWas I really crazy? Everything had seemed so real. Was it just drugs that had done that?\n\nThere was a tug on the back of my shirt and I turned, looking down to see a small girl, maybe five years old.

(The only way NID could get the colony funded was to situate it dangerously close to Neandie-infested swamps on spongy land that neither man nor corporation valued.) The fence was powered by the same enormous grid that powered the whole colony, everything from their lighbulbs to their internet connections. It was designed to set off flashing light alarms in the event of a breach by Neandies or any other swamp creature. In the colony's first year, so the story went, the alarm had flashed in warning of a troop of fire ants making their way inside. The children always laughed when they heard the story, and the seriors laughed as they told it too. Of all the children, only Krista noticed an expectation of irony in the children's laughter that was completely absent in the seniors'.\n\nOf course, the founding of the colony was more than a dozen years in the past, longer than Krista had even been alive. These days, finding a way  past the electrified mesh was a rite of passage for the colony's twelve year olds. A mandatory initiation requirement for acceptance into teenage cliques. \n\nFor a year now Krista had watched with envy as packs of teens roamed territorially along the perimeter of the colony they were to inherit. She couldn't wait to go with them, to *be* them. The gracelessness of their gangly bodies and the way their faces were pockmarked red and purple with as many pimples as mosquito bites didn't matter to her.  The teens looked more animal than human, but to Krista they seemed to live as humans ought to live. Free as nature itself. Laughing at the antics of Neandies and at the fury of hurricanes. Uncontainable by the silly mesh fence that might as well have been a cage for a proud people the world considered \"broken\", less than human. \n\nTwo years ago, three of the teens had caught themselves a small Neanderthal and made a viral video by recording and editing its attempts at escape into a hilarious series of quick shots that ended with the Neandie's naked butt jiggling as it finally succeeded and ran off into the swamps. The video had brought in more money for the families of those three teens than a month's worth of handicraft sales. Now THAT was a way to make a living: selling actual harmless cute-animal entertainment instead of commodifying their own culture and dehumanizing Deaf people!\n\nEvery chance she got - usually at night after the seniors retired to play poker or drink rum - she slipped out of the residential compound with the flashlight in her pocket and a thrum in her heart. She picked her way past the compost heaps and the stream beyond, stepping surefooted across flat stones that jutted from the water, and began her slow but thorough scan of the fence for holes gnawed by rodents. This way when time came for her initiation into the teen gangs, she'd come out roses for sure. \n\nSometimes during her search she caught glimpses of Neandies, curious as babies and gentle as doves, hovering on the wrong (or was it right?) side of the fence, seemingly entranced by her flashlight. She longed to stick her hand through the fence and touch one. Nuzzle its fur, maybe. Her father owned a genuine Neandie pelt that he hung on the east wall of his study, but it was encased in glass and he never opened the case no matter how much she begged. Too expensive, he said. Too delicate to expose to air and to the germs in Krista's fingers. Krista imagined the look on her father's face when she finally made it outside the fence, tamed her own Neanderthal, brought it home to show off. She wouldn't let dad touch it, just for spite. She'd make him beg the way he made her beg. \n\nKrista trampled along the fence for what seemed like hours. No holes anywhere. She sat down for a moment to rest the soles of her feet, and wiggled her flashlight around, casting its dim beam outside the fence. Sure enough, out popped half a dozen Neanderthals of various sizes and sexes from behind the mangrove roots beyond. She wiggled the flashlight a little more. Some of the smaller ones jumped around trying to catch it. More out of habit than anything, Krista whipped out her phone and began to record the scene. Maybe one of them would touch the fence and get buzzed, you never knew. Videos of Neandies getting buzzed and hopping away frightened, making their cute little squawky noises, usually got at least a few thousand views. \n\nTwenty bucks, easy. \n\nWhat she wasn't prepared for was this: suddenly, an enormous male Neanderthal jumped into her light. Krista gasped. Despite the sure barrier of the fence, she felt a thrill of fear and wonder at the size of this one. Its #BADWORDS# was enormous. The Neandie was looking right at her, moving its mouth ferociously and gesturing at her light and her phone, but she couldn't stop staring at its  crotch. Horror, disgust, and a perverse powerful surge of desire kept her frozen for a whole minute...\n\nAnd then she ran. \n\nShe uploaded the video without any editing because it was kind of creepy and sexy and awesome just the way it was. Even as she watched and rewatched the video, her eyes kept drifting towards that enormous #BADWORDS#. It was wrong and shameful and wonderful all at once. Krista was careful to use a #BADWORDS# account to upload the video, however. She did not want Dad knowing this was hers. \n\nThe video got a hundred hits in the very first day. \n\nThe second day, it was ten thousand. This was surprising. But since it was the weekend and she went fishing with dad so she had no way to check the comments on the video without her dad noticing. \n\nOn Monday when she checked the video she got the shock of her life. NINE MILLION VIEWS. She scrolled down to the comments, and got an even bigger shock. \n\n\"This is exactly what we have been predicting! Neandie Rights NOW!!!\" -HRWarrior\n\n \"It is shameful. This is a shameful day for humanity. This is what it takes to wake us up? How many more must die before we hear them?\" - JaimieLife56\n\n\"ne1 read the nyt article? im shaking rite now. i cant sleep.\" -drey_drey_drool\n\nHundreds and hundreds of comments. Links to newspaper articles and Neandie Rights Watch organizations. As the sound of choppers loomed over the Deaf colony, Krista finally watched her video properly, looking at the Neanderthal's face and his hands instead of his crotch. \n\n\"We are dying,\" the Neandie signed, his fingers halting and stuttering, but comprehensible nevertheless. \"Help. My baby died. You died my baby. Don't die me. Don't die my baby.\" His mouth was a slash of fury and anguish. \n\n\n\n\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1404920360","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cislpyr","link_id":"t3_2a812e","name":"t1_cislpyr","parent_id":"t3_2a812e","retrieved_on":1434626600,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

It cries out to be silenced. Oh creators, the hunger pains me, but it will never kill me. \n\nThe oldest ones created me near the dawn. My creators knew that the universe had a carrying capacity. Too much life would cause the fabric of the universe to unravel. I don't understand why, the creators didn't see fit to give me that gift of knowledge. \n\nTo prove their dedication, the creators offered themselves as the first pruning. Their planet is a husk now, barren rock, where once great cities stood. All the fantastic devices and technology that called me into being stands abandoned. And that way it will remain, until the end of time. \n\nI consumed them. Then I moved on. I followed the radio waves that ride through the universe and found new planets. I wish I could tell them why I do this, some must be sacrificed so that everything does not unravel. But most languages are too ... alien for me to learn.\n\n Each and every planet fought me, each and every one was consumed. I cannot die, the creators did not give me that gift. I will continue. \n\nSome species received warnings from their allies before their consumption. They turned off their radios, silenced their traitorous  technology before my attention could be turned to them. I am blind to them, so they live on. \n\nEons have passed, the hunger grew more than I ever could have imagined. I understand that the creators made the hunger grow as the fabric of the universe began to tear. I must consume again, or I will be left alone in a timeless void with nothing but boundless hunger. But I will not despair, a gift from my creators.\n\nThen, I saw them. New signals coming from the tail end of an arm in a spiral-shaped galaxy. They are funny creatures, I can see their broadcasts. Two legs, two arms, and a habit of killing each other needlessly. Their planet is rich in life, its removal will tip the scales more or less in balance. \n\nI sent a signal of my own back, their language is ludicrously simple. \"I'm coming for you all, my apologies.\" I know they cannot understand fully, but it makes me feel better, and the hunger is growing.

{"archived":true,"author":"QuinineGlow","body":"Excellent job anticipating the consequences of the prompt (and a particularly nice little touch with the criminals/soldiers, too). Hard to see a way the consequences could've been envisioned better. The overall storyline is very nicely done.\n\nA few suggestions:\n\nThe professor's thought process seems a little off, to me; at the same time that he's wondering why no one's attending his lecture he seems fully aware of the negative consequences of the device and thus it appears that he should've anticipated the poor attendance at his lecture. It might've worked better to have him give the speech knowing, from the very start, that no one would really be listening, but he's compelled to give the speech, anyway.\n\nAlso, the wife's speech at the end is a little heavy in 'telling' for my tastes, as opposed to 'showing'. Instead of her blatantly announcing her intentions, you might consider something more subtle (maybe instead of her just getting the device, she's had it awhile, and has been quickly drifting away from the professor, going off doing her own things outside the house, and he comes home to find her planning yet another long-term adventure somewhere away from him). It might make his (presumed) suicide at the end a little more weighty if we learn that he'd already spent a length of time knowing full well that, ever since his wife got what she wanted, he'd been losing her.\n\nFinally, as a technical matter (and also going to the whole 'show, don't tell' mantra) instead of always announcing that a character 'thinks' X, try having their thoughts/concerns expressed more through their actions and scenery descriptions; it nails two birds with one stone, so to speak (eg: 'he glanced around the empty room, brow furrowed as he counted the audience; he could've counted the number on one hand').\n\nHopefully you do make prompts your new hobby; there's quite a lot of potential in what you've written so far.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405354399","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cix4xjk","link_id":"t3_2anvrn","name":"t1_cix4xjk","parent_id":"t3_2anvrn","retrieved_on":1434709928,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Today was the day that he decided whether or not his family will cry for him today; for today was the day where children died and their painful screams were never heard his their parents tried to drown out the pleas of their offspring.\n\n*Father, I've failed,* he thought of saying, but before he could muster the courage to say it, his father lead him outside of his room and into the family room, where his entire family would witness his death.\n\nThere, he could see his mother, a lovely woman who possessed the ability to summon lighting from her very hands. His sisters were there also, both with the ability to control objects around them with their minds, *telekinesis*.\n\nThey were all smiling at him, making him feel better about himself, trying to reassure him that they were going to miss him, but Tommy knew that it was a futile attempt to hide their real feelings.\n\n\"Okay!\" His father let out a thunderous clap and everyone sat down. \"Well, let me just be the first to say that this is a very great undertaking.

She always just asked \"Did he come today?\" And I always answered \"Yes.\" One time I had made a mistake and said \"He came when you were sleeping.\" She stayed up just to see *him* for the next three days. It always hurt me to answer her question, because this far along she didn't have any visitors. \n\nThe brain tumor had messed her up real bad. It pressed right against the part of the brain that dealt with short term memory stuff. She asked me that question multiple times and hour.\n\nAt that time I wished she would hurry up and die, because every time she asked me that question my heart sank a little. Every time She woke up she would look around for *him*. He never even visited her; I never even met him but I *hated* him. That look she got one her face, he was the cause of it and he *didn't even care.* She made me feel like I was being run over by a train every time I looked at her. And every time, every time I said yes to her damn question, that smile always got to me. I had to say yes, I had to.\n\nToday she was in a better condition, so I took her outside. It was a sticky warm day, not unpleasant. \n\nShe hobbled beside me, her legs were weak. She fell, putting her hands out to brace herself. I helped her up and she put her arm around my shoulder.\n\nWe sat on a bench outside. She sat for a few moments, staring at a bird on the ground.\n\n\"Did he come today?\" she asked me.\n\nI smiled sadly and shook my head no. \n\n\"No, not today. He didn't come today,\"\n\n\"I'm sure he'll visit tomorrow, he must be busy,\" she smiled in her drugged up state.\n\nHer face turned into a panicked frown. \n\n\"We... Inside. We should wait for him.\"\n\nI helped her up and back inside. \n\nShe died in her sleep that night. I heard a man visited her in the morgue.

Nope, just a dry flattened piece of poop wrapped in a napkin. Pick pocketer? More like poop pocketer or at least that's what it felt like. Was it human poop? Or dog? So many questions, but I had to let it go. It was getting late and I needed a room.\n\nMost the crowds were thinning out, except for the mob of customers colliding into each other at the Mall's West entrance near the food courts. As I walked toward the escalators near the entrance, I noticed a mom pushing a stroller. She stops and sets a giant baby bag on the floor and begins rummaging through it. With her attention elsewhere, I #BADWORDS# her purse right off the stroller. Jackpot. I tuck it into my jacket as I walk away. It feels a little warm. Maybe she had some warm food sitting next to it? Maybe there's food in it?\n\nI get outside and take a seat on the bench. I pull the purse out of my jacket and start to unzip it. Halfway through the zip an odor seeps out and makes me gag. It smells like a thousand unwiped buttholes marinating in the hot Saharan sun.

Well, I guess I want to ask you something. I know that he's not very nice, but I think somewhere he has good in his heart. Just like Uncle Bobby.\" The brown-haired girl stopped for a moment to think about what was told to her about her mom's brother, not knowing what he truly was until she was years older.

A large armored truck had crashed through the wall of the bank. Everyone was silent and doing their best to hide behind small walls and desks when the driver's door opened and out walked a shadowy figure. \n\n\"Now everyone, lisssten very clossssely. If you move, ssspeak, or try to essscape, I will end you.\" The shadowy figure continued to walk until it was clear who was speaking: Johnny \"Snake Eyes\" Domagio, the mob boss's newest goon that was infused with snake DNA. Snake Eyes's tongue fluttered out of his mouth, tasting the air in front of him. He could taste their fear. He could taste their hearts beating faster in their chest. And he loved it. \n\nWill Carter had just turned 20 years old. He was scrawny and awkward, with bad eyesight and worse body odor. He had just come to cash in his paycheck and leave, and now this. He felt a quick buzz in his pocket and his heart shot into his chest. He knew exactly who it was texting him in a time like this. The teller he was trying to flirt with had pushed the emergency 911 button. He forgot that in a moment of valor, he had enlisted in the new civilian crime fighting force. \n\nHe slowly pulled out his phone, hoping Snake Eyes hadn't seen him. He opened it silently and his fears were confirmed. One new text. \n\n\"Hello, this is Barb from the CCFF. We have received a report of a robbery in your area. Please do all that is within your power to help justice be served.\"\n\nWill sighed and reluctantly stood up. \"If I die today I'm gonna be so pissed off.\" He thought to himself as he got ready to do what he hoped he would never had had to. \"Hey #BADWORDS#!\" he shouted to the snake-like man who was loading bags fill of cash. But Snake Eyes didn't hear him. \n\n\"#BADWORDS#! #BADWORDS#! Lizard dude! Hey! Joey!\" Will shouted. Snake Eyes finally stopped and looked around. \"Is someone calling me?\" He asked. \"Yeah, that'd be me.\" Will replied, waving to get his attention. \"And who are you?\" Snake Eyes asked, his cold blood boiling with rage that someone had interrupted him. \"I'm... Uh...\" Will didn't really think this far ahead. He wanted to be cool and tough, like the members of the CCFF who had fought before him. His eyes darted around the room until he finally reached over and grabbed a stapler on the desk next to him. \"I'm stapler-man. Guy. I guess.\" Will stammered. \n\nThere was a long silence as the new foes sized each other up. \"HAHAHA!\" Snake Eyes cackled. He doubled over in laughter and wiped a tear from his eye. He stood up and saw that Will was still standing, clutching a single stapler and tryin not to tremble in fear. \"Oh wait, are you serious?\" Snake Eyes asked, his smirk dropping in disappointment. \"Are you really the guy?\" \"Yeah, uh, it's me. We're getting a bit short on heroes.\" Snake Eyes sighed and slithered up to Will. \n\n\"Look, kid, I appreciate you doing this and all, but you gotta realize it's not even fun for me when the odds are really stacked in my favor like this.\" Will's entire body was tensed up in fear of the super-villain whispering in his ear. \"So look,\" Snake Eyes continued, his tongue darting in and out of his mouth, tasting the surrounding air. \"I'm gonna fight you now, and I'll hit you a few times and you'll hit me a few times and then I'm going to leave with all of the bags of money I have, but I'll make it look like you won, alright?\" Snake Eyes' tongue stopped licking the air. \"Also, kid,\" he continued, \"ya gotta stop nervous farting.\" \n\nWill nodded. He sucker punched Snake Eyes but didn't hurt him at all. The fight lasted about 5 minutes before Snake Eyes slithered out of the bank, vowing to get revenge on Stapler-Man, the new hero of the city. Will knew he didn't really do anything and didn't deserve the attention he was about to get, but he did get numbers from like 5 girls, so he was counting that as a win.

It was less than 15 minutes before I could leave for the day.  Less than 15 minutes until I could leave and meet Steph for dinner.  \n\nMy eyes flitted back to my clock. 4:15:41 pm.  *Jesus, the day after the fiscal year deadlines is slow,* I thought to myself.  Not that I minded.  I haven't had to listen to Richard's inane commentary all day.  Being stuck in the cubicle right next to his means I have to hear him chime in to any of my business calls. Today, all I've heard from his cube is the tapping sound of his typing on the keyboard.  I'd prefer to keep it that way.\n\nRIIING!\n\nI #BADWORDS# involuntarily in surprise as my office phone intruded on my thoughts.  *Not now, I'm so close to leaving for the day!*  The click-click of Richard's typing stopped.  He was definitely eavesdropping.  I sigh quietly enough that he won't hear, and pick up the phone.\n\n\"Supply chain management, Powell speaking,\" I said automatically.\n\nThe line is silent.  I listened for a couple of seconds.  Still nothing.\n\n\"Supply chain management,\" I repeated.  \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Um... hi, Kevin.\"  The voice on the other end of the line sounded familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it.\n\n\"Yes, this is Kevin Powell.  Can I help you?\"  \n\n\"Hi, Kevin... ummm.. this is...\"  the voice trailed off for a second. I still couldn't tell where I've heard that nasal-sounding voice before, but I couldn't *stand* the sound of it. *Is this guy re#BADWORDS#ed or something?*\n\n\"Yes?\" I urged, trying to keep my professional composure.\n\n\"This is Kevin Powell.  It's... me... I guess I'm you.\"  \n\n\"I'm sorry?\" I had no idea what to say to that.  Was someone pranking me?\n\n\"I know you don't believe me,\" the voice on the other end of the line sounded hesitant.  \"Your dinner reservations are for 7:30, but you really just want to go home and build your castle in Minecraft.\" I suddenly felt cold.  The reservation was booked online.  I never told anyone about my secret Minecraft addiction.  Someone must be tracking my home internet behavior.  Was I talking to an NSA goon? \n\n\"Dad used to call me... call *you* his 'bedwetting midget' when you were a kid,\" the voice on the other line continued, more urgently now. Through the phone, I heard a sharp guffaw that sounded just like Richard.  I pulled the phone away from my ear for a second, but Richard was silent.  Probably still listening to me on the phone.  I put the phone back to my ear. No one knew about that name besides my parents, and they're both gone now.  Was this guy for real?  Do I really sound like that over the phone?\n\n\"Don't say anything, we don't have much time.  Right now, I'm talking to you from the future.  It's 4:17, so I'm probably only a minute ahead.  But listen, we have the chance to violate causality!  This could be huge!\"  The voice was getting excited now.  \"Listen, just whatever you do, don't bump the phone.  I just--\"\n\nThe phone went silent, and I looked up.  I had been trembling so hard that I yanked the cord right out of our receiver.

This was really happening?\n\n\"Yes, this is Kevin Powell.  Can I help you?\"  \n\n\"Hi, Kevin... ummm.. this is...\" I trailed off.  *Oh my god, I sound like a re#BADWORDS# on the phone!* I realized.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"This is Kevin Powell.  It's... me... I guess I'm you,\"  I stammered lamely.\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" my past self said.  My mind raced for a way to move this conversation faster.  I had to convince my past self that this was real.\n\n\"I know you don't believe me. Your reservations are for 7:30, but you really just want to go home and build your castle in Minecraft,\" I said.  *#BADWORDS#, is that what I heard future-me say?* \n\n\"Dad used to call me,\" I continued, momentarily forgetting where I was. \"...call *you* his 'bedwetting midget' when you were a kid,\" I blurted.\n\nI heard Richard burst out laughing with a loud guffawing noise.  *#BADWORDS#. Did I really have to repeat that just the way I heard it?*  I could feel my cheeks growing warm.  *Keep it together, Kevin.  You're talking to yourself from the past.  You can get him to fix this.*  I looked at the clock. 4:17:15.\n\n\"Don't say anything, we don't have much time.  Right now, I'm talking to you from the future.

I would be lucky if I only got the nickname \"bedwetting midget\" around the office.  I sat motionless in my seat, phone in hand.

It had been seventeen years since the burden of knowledge had passed from demigod to man. Many people raged against the demigod. These battles raged on even today.  This demigod, Zhanch, had been a source of comfort for the whole of civilization just two decades ago. Zhanch had enjoyed an abundance of joy, laughter, and well natured actions. He loved the people of Lurna. They had been loyal to him. They had cheered for him during his annual period of tribulation when he underwent self created challenges to overcome. They had loved him. They had cherished him… until Spuke had stolen his secret. \nIt was discovered that their actions in life had been manipulated with an end in mind. Spuke, the champion of Lurna had pointed accused Zhanch himself of being the sole conspirator seeking such an end. In fact, Zhanch sought this end feverishly. It was revealed to the people of Lurna that their situation and well being had been molded by Zhanch to ensure a devilish outcome. They had had a veil slowly pulled over their communal eyes. The last million years had all been a farce. Their culture and history had been created to convince the people to establish Zhanch’s measures of happiness and sorrow, right and wrong, truth and lies. He had succeeded.\n\nNow, seventeen years later the wars still raged against Zhanch and his supporters. Some didn’t believe Spuke. According to them, Zhanch was the only possible source of happiness and well being. His most loyal servants had immediately turned upon him at the start of the wars. They had plotted and schemed to kill Zhanch, to rid the world of his evil means and ends. Those that rose to support him initial were those that sought his favor. They did this by eradicating those once loyal to him turned Judas. \n\nBut what about those supporting him today couldn’t really believe that nonsense, could they? They must see his evil. His schemes and manipulations could never be clearer! We have suffered for seventeen years because of his plots! \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe battle raged on. Zhanch looked out over the battlefield. Surely this must be the final battle he thought to himself. This madness cannot continue. “There must be some way that I can convince those fighting this battle of my good nature,” he said to his advisors. Their reply was always the same, “Sir, we must eliminate the threat. The rebels seek to destroy you and your supporters. We cannot let that happen.” “I don’t care what it costs me. I will stop this madness. Brother killing brother. This is wrong,” he thought.\n\nThe morning sun was bright, warm and comforting as Zhanch walked confidently out onto the battlefield. He wore no armor; he carried no weapons. He greeted his followers with smiles and compassion. His enemies cheered loudly from their encampment a short distance across the now barren field. They chanted, “ZHANCH DIES TODAY! ZHANCH DIES TODAY!” Zhanch turned to their encampment slowly. He walked calmly into the barren waste that had once been a beautiful field of grass, flowers and trees. He recalled a memory from a time of serenity in that field. He had had a lover, passionate and beautiful in that field. It seemed impossible the field could ever recover from the devastation caused by the rival armies. \n\n“I have come to you,” Zhanch bellowed, “to talk! To engage your minds of reason! This war must end!” \n\nThe combatants in the rival camp cheered louder, “ZHANCH DIES TODAY!”\n\n“Will you not listen?!” cried Zhanch. “I have sought no suffering. I have only ever wished for peace. Your champion has filled your minds with lies. He has calloused you against my desires in pursuit of his own power. Think now. Do you enjoy life more believing that I have betrayed you? Do you cherish your pursuit of my death and demise as you once did your own livelihoods?”\nThe combatants seemed to lull for a moment in consideration. Spuke leapt forward #BADWORDS#ing a spear towards Zhanch. “ZHANCH DIES TODAY!” he chanted, first as an individual, then gradually as one soldier in an army. \n\nZhanch sighed heavily. He was visible worn. This war had exhausted him. “I had only ever tried to make you happy. My manipulations were not for my own benefit. I have never acted in a selfish manner. I never will,” he whispered. “I offer my life for peace,” he spoke in a hushed breath, “I offer it on the condition that life resume as it was. Happy, fulfilled, and cherished by all members of Lurna. If you truly believe me to be the devil behind the scenes I will suc#BADWORDS#b to your needs to cleanse.”\n\nZhanch with his head raised, eyes locked with Spuke, stepped forward towards the combatants’ camp. The cheering stopped. Silence gripped the throats of all. Zhanch took another step. A cold sensation pierced his mind. Bolts of ice exploded through his nervous system. “Is this fear?” Zhanch thought. He had never felt fear in all of his life. He had always addressed problems with logic and compassion. He had never been let down by his mind before. Why should he be afraid now? “I’m giving them what they want. What they think they need. If they are happy then I must be too,” he said under his breath to comfort himself. \nA voice behind him whispered, “But if they are happy, how will I profit from their wars?” \nFire now filled his veins. Zhanch understood now that feeling of fear was not emotionally driven. He had been poisoned by his own brethren. He turned to look at the man standing behind him. His favored commander stood before him. “You? YOU?!” Zhanch bellowed. The ranks of supporters behind the commander were visibly shaken by the sudden outburst from their beloved leader. \n\nThe commander spoke softly to keep their conversation private, “But of course it is me. Who else profits from this war? I have no family, no children, no friends. But I do have ample supply of land. And on that land? On that land I have: stone, wood, grains and livestock. The resources only ever really **needed** in war. Sure, they can be used for construction and food supply but without war what’s the point of population growth? My bottom line would never have expanded before Spuke blurted out your secret. He didn’t even tell the people what you had planned. Just that you had a plan and they were part of it. See, that’s the beauty of it. Your advisors told you to lay low for a time so that the people could build their resentment of you. You could have washed all of this grief away simply by telling them your pursuits. Your stupid altruistic goals. Happiness?! It only exists when you have an equally bad situation to compare to. How could someone know they are happy without knowing sorrow? I have more power now than you ever did. I have the power to destroy. I will give the people something terrible to compare their happy little lives to.”\n\nZhanch collapsed. How could he have let such evil retain such a pivotal role in his advisors? How did he miss this man’s nature? The commander suddenly struck Zhanch. Zhanch reeled back in surprise. The commander had not done so voluntarily. A long spear stuck out from the commanders’ chest a few inches below the neck. \n\nSpuke had never known Zhanch’s goal. He had found a small diary kept by a long since dead lover of Zhanch in a woodchuck’s burrow. The diary was poorly preserved. It was faded, tattered and torn having been exposed to the elements for such a long duration. He read the passages he had found in their entirety to his comrades. He openly admitted during the initial backlash that the goal of Zhanch had not been establish and should be sought. Zhanch’s silence on the matter fueled the anger in Lurna, eventually leading to violence between two brothers in a town square. \n\nSpuke had had advisors of his own. One such advisor, a deaf man that communicated only through text and abbreviated hand gestures could read the lips of nearby orators. His advisors deftly conveyed the words spoken by Zhanch’s commander with haste. Spuke realizing that Zhanch deserved at least a fair say instead of an execution launched his spear targeting the commander. \n\nZhanch remained still. He gasped for shallow breaths. There was still a crushing feeling in his body. The prongs of ice still stuck through his organs and limbs. He fell to his elbows and slid to a prone position. He slowly released a breath of air and whispered, “Please, put this madness in the past. Move on.” His heart stopped beating and his muscles relaxed.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405564027","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cizlzr6","link_id":"t3_2awtkt","name":"t1_cizlzr6","parent_id":"t3_2awtkt","retrieved_on":1434754186,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Generic characters (the sidekick, for example) are not protected. Some courts require this delineation to be quite extensive, to the point that the character \"cons#BADWORDS#utes the story being told.\" In Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119 (2d. Cir. 1930), however, the court held that the character needs simply be more than just a \"type\" and this is achieved when they are drawn in considerable detail. If characters with visual images are involved (i.e., cartoons, movies, etc.), then courts are more likely to allow copyright protection because the visual image combined with conceptual qualities gives courts a more concrete sense of character delineation.

{"archived":true,"author":"cpates","body":"I like to walk home after a long day of copyediting; I work at an advertisting firm, utilizing my Masters degree in literature primarily to make punchy sentences printed over bright pictures in trendy magazines better. I've got my schedule down to a science; you see, I'm working on a novel-- a semi-autobiographical thing about an ad man who falls in love and has to give up everything he loves for his family. From 9-5 I take in, receiving work from my superiors and coworkers, editing it, thinking great, voluminous thoughts, daydreaming, maybe jotting down brief notes. When I get off I am often overwhelmed with trying to keep all these things in my head so I like to walk home, as I am doing now, thinking of nothing, clearing my mind, so that when I do reach my home I will be fresh and the most important thoughts of the day will still be in my mind.\n\nSo, here I am, it's 5:17, I am 12 minutes into my walk which leaves 6 until I reach my apartment, and I start to hear a whisper from behind and to the right of me. \n\n*I'm nothing... I should just do it... no one loves me...*\n\nStartled at some stranger's oversharing, I look back over my shoulder and see a girl who can't be more than 17, head down, dripping big fat tears down her face. Her mouth is not moving. And yet I still hear this muted whispering; it gets quieter, then louder, like there's... Static interference but I pick out some syllables.\n\n*Jason... Cheated... Party... Razorblade*\n\nThe last word shrieks through my cranium, and I must admit that I crouch and cover my ears on the crowded downtown street, feeling denim and flannel and leather brush past me as that echo fades back into nothingness in my head. Finally I continue walking, undisturbed, quickly stepping around puddles, up 5th Avenue before finally, blessedly, reaching my apartment. \n\nI sit before my manuscript contained on my computer screen for some time, shivering, unable to create. I type a thought out and delete it; type, delete; an hour passes like this. I get up and brew myself some Earl Grey Tea. That always helps. \n\nThe smell of the herbs boiling in my little chrome teapot calms me, finally, and I breathe a sigh of relief. My mind is clear of whatever it is possessed me on the street, even if I am still thinking about it. I drink my tea, settle into my big armchair bundled up in a blanket and watch an episode of Downton Abbey. By 9:30 I am rightfully tuckered out, and retire to bed after flossing and brushing my teeth. I lie in bed trying not to concern myself with the day's lack of progress as I have been doing well recently and do not deserve that negativity. I finally doze off to sleep and as my consciousness slips away, the whispers slip back.\n\n*Somebody help me. I'm nothing, I want to die. I'll show her. I don't mean it, please forgive me.* A washed out image of a slumped over body in a bathroom, feminine, wearing a white tank top and comfortable sweatpant-shorts. I am in the upper corner of the bathroom; there is a red liquid dripping out of her arms onto the tile. \n\n*You knew... You knew... You knew... You knew...*\n\n*DING DING DING DING DING*\n\nI gasp, wrenching my body upward from the mattress, still seeing that girl. That girl from the street corner. It was her, I know this even though I didn't see her face. I feel faint, like my blood is gone, metallic. I look around my room fuzzily, not fixing on anything, finally put on my glasses. Grab my phone. Call work.\n\n\"Hi, this is Alexander Newman, I'm not feeling well today.\"\n\n....\n\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you, I should be back tomorrow, I appreciate the concern.\"\n\n...\n\n\"No, no, there's nothing you can do, I just have a head cold but thanks for offering. Alright, take care.\"\n\nSince the age of 17 or so I have had a bit of an obsession with mental health; since I attempted suicide half-heartedly, what the professionals call a \"cry for help\", I have known that the thoughts I have can be controlled, made positive. I meet with my psychiatrist once a week, I meet with my behavioral analyst twice a month, I meditate, I write down my dreams in a journal, I have a neurologist from whom I receive a scan twice a year, I have them interpret my brain activity and optimize my creativity thusly. I am in touch with myself, I know what I want, deep down, I do not repress. But this is something new. I know that what started last night has never happened to me before, I know what my feelings feel like and THAT--WAS--NOT--IT.\n\nI call my neurologist. \"Hey Jan, I was hoping to schedule a meeting with Bill, ideally today, it's a bit of an emergency. Yes, I know it's last minute. Yes, I'll hold.\"\n\nWhile the polite elevator music plays I feel myself collapsing and breath out a single wracking sob. When she comes back I am composed.\n\n\"In 45 minutes? Perfect, I'll be there. Thanks so much.\"\n\n\nWhen I finally meet with Bill, he is a bit distracted as he ushers me into his office; checking his phone, looking above me.\n\n\"So how are you doing?\" He asks.\n\n\"Good, good. Except for one thing.\" I pause. \"Last night... Jesus, it sounds so crazy... Well I was walking home from work and I started hearing this girl's suicidal thoughts. They were faint, like whispers in my head, I thought someone was talking to me. But no one was. And then when I went to sleep... I saw her. Kill herself. Felt her feelings. I was there with her. I coulda DONE SOMETHING!\" \n\nI shriek this last part, hyperventilating, gripping the arms of my chair. Bill is alarmed; we've known each other for years, he knows I do not exaggerate. \"Well then. Let's... Just... See what's going on in there.\"\n\nI am ushered to the MRI room, strip, put on the hospital gown, lay down in the chamber. The cold leather gives my ass goosebumps between the slit of the gown. The lights go off, I slide backwards into the chamber, 45 seconds, I slide out. I meet Bill back in his office, him holding the X-ray with a not-all-too-reassuring look on his face.\n\n\"So what is it?\"\n\n\"Well... You've got some... Irregularities. I'm sure someone like yourself is aware that human consciousness extends beyond the five senses, right? You can feel when someone is looking at you, what is around you, other people's sadness and happiness can spread to you even if you try not to respond.\" \n\nThroughout this I am coldly nodding my head.\n\n\"Well... There's a part of the brain that is used for empathy. It connects with all the senses and... Analyzes the stimulus you receive... to try and turn what you see of other people... into how you would feel.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\n\"This part of the brain is most powerful when concerned with sadness, death. Evolutionarily, it developed to help us cope with the knowledge that our time on Earth is not infinite. Essentially, every person has some ability to pick up what other people are feeling and feel it themselves.\"\n\nI am still nodding my head, dully.\n\n\"Well... When you attempted suicide you experienced a range of emotions usually reserved for a body about to die. I'm sure you've heard that when you are dying, your body releases DMT, you start dreaming, your life flashes before your eyes. All of this happened to you; you became familiar with what for most people is immediately followed by death.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"In rare cases... This range of emotion... Confined to those near death... overwhelms the brain, becomes all that that person can experience. An overwhelming, dreamlike existence overtakes this person, as they are unable to exit this state.\"\n\n\"And that's what happened to me?\"\n\nAt this, Bill shuffles the papers in his lap.\n\n\"Not exactly. You have conceptualized, come to terms with these massive feelings that most people die from. Your brain has turned inward, endlessly analyzed itself, found out most everything. And so it seems your empathy-center has now turned outwards, like a... Reciever, picking up random jolts of thought that it believes others are feeling from what your senses tell you. And because of your experience, the strongest signals, which cloud out all others, are thoughts of suicide and death.\"\n\nI feel my heart grow cold. \"What are you trying to tell me?\"\n\nAt this, Dr. Bill stops shuffling the papers, looks up at me, removes his spectacles, and stares deep into me. \n\n\"You have developed the ability to experience someone else's suicidal feelings, and every brief flash of this feeling that you receive, your brain constructs an entire world around that feeling, fleshing it out, developing the truth of it within your subconscious, until you fall asleep and it all rushes out at you at once.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405652479","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj0l6y1","link_id":"t3_2b08ml","name":"t1_cj0l6y1","parent_id":"t3_2b08ml","retrieved_on":1434771319,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Partageons","body":"His chambers were only about twice his size, but King Mavros XIV still wanted to pace within them.\n\nThere was little danger of an attack from the side of the castle; a powerful tower stood there to ward off attacks. It was the front that worried him greatly. The enemy had been massing nearby for some time; a scout had even been sighted within two kilometres. They appeared to be casting yearning glances toward him and his three personal guards, and the great tower to his side.\n\nPhairon, one of the guards, appeared to share his su#BADWORDS#ions in his one-track minded way. \"I don't like this. It's making me nervous. You ought to call in some of your other troops to defend.\"\n\n\"I told you, they're off on an important mission that, if I calculated right, should decimate the enemy.\"\n\n\"A mission on the other side of the world, where they can hardly help us.\"\n\nGaxos was the quiet one of the guards, but now he spoke, in brief and hushed phrases. \"They've got everything lined up. It may look like they're just idling from here. But I know my battles. I know a prepared battle formation when I see it.\"\n\nMavros fleetingly thought to slap the guard for insolence, but chose to accept the wisdom instead. \"You mean...\"\n\nA nod. \"They're coming here. Soon.\"\n\nThe king was convinced. \"I'll see if I can spare a warlock, or maybe the two of them—\"\n\n\"We lost the one pretty soon after the battle started, sire.\" This was from Chourai, the third guard.\n\n\"Indeed. And he took an enemy knight down with him, didn't he?\" Mavros chuckled as he wrote down the orders for help at the stronghold, and sent them away. \"Forces are even on both sides; I think—\"\n\n\"Enemy approaches!\" said Phairon. Mavros squinted out over the battlements; an enemy warlock approached quickly. The white of his robe disgusted the king.\n\n\"Wait...Chourai! Look out!\"\n\nThe third guard had time to raise his sword, but a powerful bolt of energy came through and knocked him to the ground.\n\n\"No,\" breathed the king. \"Not...\"\n\nThe warlock stood before him, and to his left. \"It seems you're in danger, your Majesty,\" he said in a voice that sounded like shattered teeth falling from a skull.\n\n\"Not for long. I think you'll find I'm a capable warrior myself.\" Mavros drew his dagger and put it through the warlock's heart. But in doing so, he found himself at the gates of the fortress. How far had the battle taken him?\n\nThe old man fell to his knees, blood dripping from his mouth. King Mavros took the staff from him, and (not knowing how to use it) snapped it in half.\n\nNow here was an enemy knight, galloping across the plains beside the fortress where the king's armies carried out his assigned task. The knight had some further jaunty words for Mavros.\n\nHe shouted back into the stronghold. \"Gaxos! Phairon!\"\n\n\"Yes, my liege,\" the two said, slightly out of sync.\n\n\"I cannot return. I see that if I do, the enemy will gather and overrun us in the tight space. I must go out, out into the world.\"\n\n\"As you wish, my liege.\"\n\n\"We shall hold the fort here.\"\n\nKing Mavros surveyed the world before him. He could not re-enter the castle, and he also could not take the side road; the enemy knight was ready to spring an ambush there. That left him but one choice: the full and open plains.\n\nThe destruction of his fortress made one thought occur to him. *Chourai's death was not in vain, for in killing that warlock, I have made our army the more powerful. If I can survive this excursion, I will win.*\n\n**To be continued** (but only if you people repeatedly remind me to)\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405660107","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj0o6xl","link_id":"t3_2b0tv8","name":"t1_cj0o6xl","parent_id":"t3_2b0tv8","retrieved_on":1434772728,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

He, or even she, was already quite a way above them by Sophie's arrival, so it was hard to know for sure.\n\nSomething about her expression must have concerned the young man, who nudged her arm and narrowed his brows.\n\n\"You alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she lied.\n\nIt was the wrong question for him to ask. It brought back sensations that weren't alright: her ribs, shattering against the glove compartment of her boyfriend's Acura as he got rammed from behind, digging into her lungs. Next, the fleeting second of her chest *emptying* itself on the same floorboard that caught nickles and McDonald's fries. Her body ached. From a sentence, she was #BADWORDS# back into that moment along with every bit of agony sealed with it. \n\nIn the betrayal of her senses, Sophie squirmed to face Michael, her boyfriend in the passenger seat, but there was only bent metal and blood.\n\nShe closed her eyes and rubbed the bridge of her nose, as if it could massage out the images of the crash.\n\n\"We're dead,\" she stated.\n\nThere was a pause in the span normally filled by the man's light-hearted comments. She turned to him, noticing him, studying him, as he leaned forward into his knees sighing.\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah we are.\"\n\nOne of the consequences of being human is how easy it is to focus on the present. Entire moments are simplified down to a sigh, or a glance, or a laugh. It shrinks the world down to bite-sized adventures, and it makes life manageable. And when the moment is gone, there is another moment, a small piece of forever, just as easy to digest and forget if needed. But in death, those snapshots come back. They are bolstered with new life, reinforced by lost senses. Recombining, they have the potential of swallowing up, if new moments are created to take their place. \n\n\"What's your name,\" she asked, hoping to provide such a moment.\n\nHe looked back, startled by question's simplicity.\n\n\"Oh, James. Sorry, I feel like that's something I probably should have said sooner.\"\n\n\"No worries, I didn't ask sooner. And I'm Sophie, also.\" She stuck out her arm for a handshake, as awkward a gesture as it was. James laughed lightly, easily, as he shook her hand. \n\n\"It's very nice to meet you, Sophie,\" he said with an exaggerated formality.\n\n\"Maybe we can be friends in the Kingdom of Heaven.\" She leaned back and waved her arm across the pearly gates, which remained shut. The both of them laughed heartily this time finally at ease.\n\n\"Already making friends, how delightful,\" spoke a melodic voice from behind them.\n\nSophie and James rose immediately, turning to face their Creator. Although originally tense and rigid, Sophie immediately relaxed her poise.\n\nGod, as he stood before them, took the shape of a 30-year-old man, roughly, with messy blonde hair that shimmered against the light from heaven. His hazel eyes fought back a small web of winkles all from behind simple oval glasses, with a polished silver frame. Staring into His eyes, it felt as if He was sharing all the comfort and wisdom expected of a deity, offering it up amicably. What really brought a smile to Sophie's face, was God's choice of clothing. He wore light-blue pajama pants with stars and crescent moons on them and a sheer white button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up. Sophie wasn't exactly expecting God to arrive in a formal suit, but the informality of his attire made it hard to fight a grin.\n\nStepping forward barefoot, God looked back and forth at Sophie and James. The wrinkles of his eyes seemed to spread larger.\n\n\"Aren't we missing someone?\"\n\nStruggling with the courage to engage the ultimate Creator in conversation, Sophie manged only to point up to the distant body on Heaven's gates after failing to articulate a single word correctly. God raised his brows as he cut between the two, and placed his hand on the gate. From above a quick yelp came, followed only by the sound of air rushing past the falling stranger, and then the harsh thud as he slammed into ground full-force. Sophie shot James a look of disbelief, who only covered his mouth and stared wide-eye at the body face down on the ground.\n\n\n\"Is he dead?\" asked Sophie of God.\n\nGod, at first stoic when turning to face Sophie, quickly burst out into a fit of laughter. It was only then that she recognized the absurdity of her question, and began laughing herself.\n\nMoaning, the body rolled onto it's back with only an expression of discomfort to bare as a wound. Sophie looked for the eyes of a stranger, and found them, but they lived in a memory. \n\nWhile at a pool doing laps, the person in the next lane over starts to inch ahead of her. Reaching the wall, she flips, spins, and kicks off it, launching herself towards the other side, emerging ahead again. The stranger, worse at the maneuver, starts a body length behind her, but gains speed quickly and compe#BADWORDS#vely. Four laps go on like this, until he grabs the wall and shouts, \"You win! Mercy!\"\n\nHalfway to the other side Sophie realizes her compe#BADWORDS#or vanished. Seeing him leaning against the wall, she swims back. She takes off her goggles and focuses on him for the first time noticing the thin scar on his cheek, his wet brown hair, and his deep blue eyes, the same deep blue eyes on the ground in front of her. They barely exchange their names before he asks her out on their first date.\n\n\"Michael,\" she murmurs. \n\nMichael looks up at her, smiling at first, until the realization of her presence clicks into place.\n\n\"Oh. God dammit, you too?\"\n\nSophie moves her hand to cover her cries, but it's too late. It's the love of her life, dead, dead with her, outside Heaven. The tears were coming, the sobs were coming, and she was helpless against them. Even in those fractured minutes in the wreckage of the car, blinking at the metal box encasing her, calling his name, she knew he was already gone. The impact came from his side. He didn't have a chance. But during those minutes on earth and her minutes beyond it, she didn't think to put the pieces together about where he'd go after his life ended.\n\n\"I'm so, so, so sorry,\" he pleaded, his own eyes welling up with tears. \n\nExtending an hand to him, he quickly took it, and immediately they were in each other's arms, embracing.  \n\nIt wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault.\" It's all she can bring herself to save, overwhelmed with grief and relief.\n\n\"There's been a mistake,\" God spoke, taking off his glasses and dropping them into thin air. \"There were only supposed to be two people here.\"\n\nThe couple turned to God and James, perplexed. Michael clasped Sophie's hand like a lifeline. Over the course of their reunion, Sophie had nearly forgotten about James, who stood only a few feet away. His hands were bound behind him, and his ankles had sunk into red, pulsing ground. Tears streamed down his eyes.\n\n\n\"I'm not going to heaven, am I?\" James asked. God shook his head. \n\n\"You are here to see the lives you've squandered with your recklessness, and to make your peace. I believe you have.\"\n\nAround him, the ground opened wide, billowing up smoke into the sky. *The driver*, Sophie realized.\n\n\"It was nice meeting you, Sophie,\" James smiled, as the smoke overtook his body, and he slowly dropped past the rest of them. As soon as he was out of sight, the ground closed again, leaving only the faint smell of sulfur as a reminder of his presence.\n\n\nGod did not look pleased by James' departure from his realm. \"I should have expected as much,\" He said to Himself. He turned back to the couple, staring at their clasped hands.\n\n\"What did you mean when you said there was a mistake?\"\n\nSophie held God's gaze as she spoke the words, trying to bury a rising su#BADWORDS#ion, a su#BADWORDS#ion met.\n\n\"You are not supposed to die today.\"\n\n\"I don't care! I'm staying,\" she shouted at God. Her body shook from head to toe, although she didn't notice. The only thing preventing her from stepping forward and challenging His decision face-to-face was Michael, horrified, pulling her back to his side. It didn't take long for her body to betray her, and drop her own her knees. She felt cold, as if her blood had turned to ice water.\n\n\"Why can't I stay,\" she pleaded, knowing the futility of her question. \"Will I at least remember this?\"\n\nGod shook his head, touching Sophie's shoulder.\n\n\"It is simply not your time. I'm sorry, Child. You will return soon enough.\"\n\nMichael watched silently as Sophie slowly faded back into the world and away from him.\n\nEDIT: Feel free to critique, either with replies or PMs. Sorry for occasional grammar/spelling issues","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405780036","downs":0,"edited":"1405795471","gilded":0,"id":"cj1sa7l","link_id":"t3_2b4inc","name":"t1_cj1sa7l","parent_id":"t3_2b4inc","retrieved_on":1434792177,"score":12,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":12}

{"archived":true,"author":"deadtextbook","body":"I thumb back the hammer on my gun and pull the trigger, languishing in the energy of the recoil as it bucks against the natural tension of my forearms. My vision is red, a hard and focused red like the blood of the aliens as they skitter and struggle before me. I gracefully knock finishing rounds into whatever it is they call a head. This is how it always is, with me silencing their screeches until only my trusted revolver echoes through the tunnels.\n\nThere was a time when those cries of pain meant something to me, in the early days of the war. Scientists picked apart their ugly spider heads and wrote papers on whatever they found inside of them. Intelligent thoughts, plans, emotions. Same as us, or so we thought. Then the spiders started picking us apart too, and what they found is the same stuff pumping now through my veins. Adrenaline.\n\nIf only they hadn't found it, or hadn't put such a high value on it. Then we might have been like any other species, welcomed into some vast galactic community like a new family at the neighborhood barbecue. Instead we became a commodity, a resource to be gathered and sold discreetly. After all, most of the species in the Empire were not unlike our own, as determined to defend their morality was they are to undermine it. But the Empire could never defend something with such a high price on it, not with the interplanetary drug cartels so well armed and capable of toppling the Imperial government. Earth was left to fight on it's own.\n\nLike any resource, the more rare we became, the higher the price on our heads were. The Battle of Earth was a slow-burning war that accelerated into an onslaught as criminals from all over the Empire sought to make a profit. Women were killed indiscriminately as they were only needed to breed the men who produced the most amount of testosterone. In the ultimate Catch-22, the humans who went quietly or surrendered quickly were killed, as it was a sign their fight-or-flight instincts didn't easily kick in. It only took 203 days until the last pockets of resistance on Earth were wiped out.\n\nI don't think about that anymore. As one of the few remaining resistance fighters on Earth, I am no more than a fading symbol of defiance. I am a lonely #BADWORDS#-you to the vastness of the criminal underbelly of the Empire. All I need is my anger and the strength it brings me as I run through the old subway tunnels killing every last one of them. I haven't eaten for days yet I feel I don't need it. I don't need sleep, I don't need love, or companionship. All I need is revenge. I can find plenty of it down here, where the alien #BADWORDS# have taken residence.\n\nI've been running for hours when I skid to halt. The subway tunnel has changed. The familiar cold concrete have become dirt walls of a cavern dug by some alien machine. I am perplexed briefly but still I reload my weapon, walking carefully forward.\n\nThe earthen walls turn away from each other and into darkness as I realize I am standing in a massive chamber. A fine wet mist obscures my vision beyond a few meters, so I keep walking carefully forward. Thousands of long, smooth pipes cross the ground before me and I'm forced to carefully walk on them to move forward. I admit I've never encountered this, even during my time as in the early days of the war, when I was a simple grunt in the United Nations Defense Forces.\n\nI can hear my heart beating in my ears as I advance. The long smooth pipes lead into rows of giant metal tubes that extend upwards beyond sight. They hum in a slow but steady and familiar pace. I notice that the rivets on them are pronounced enough that they could be used to climb up. Tucking my revolver into the back of my pants, I begin pulling myself up.\n\nMy breathing becomes calmer as I fall into the steady rhythm of the climb. I don't see much for almost an hour of climbing, and for the first time in a long time I become aware of how tired my arms are. Then I begin to see it: smaller cylinders tucked between the tubes still extending upwards. A single small window sit in the middle of them. They are arranged in perfect rows again, fitting the perfect and strange symmetry of everything I've seen in the vast chamber.\n\nI push the thought out of my mind as I reach the cylinders with labored breath and burning calves. The mist has settled on the window, so I let go with one hand and use my sleeve to wipe it clean.\n\nA face stares back at me. \n\nI shout out in panic and the man's eyes bulge open, causing me to almost loose my grip. Somehow I manage to hold on, squeezing my eyes shut in desperate fear. I know that the system of pipes within the chamber is what I had always heard of: a farm of humans. But that's not what nearly makes me vomit in terror. Suddenly everything dawns on me, and my heart nearly stops in shock.\n\nThe face in the chamber is my own.\n\nWhy do I carry a revolver?\nWhy do I always want to fight?\nWhy do I never sleep, eat, piss?\nWhy am I never calm?\n\nBut the answer rings outloud in a strange, mechanical voice that would be indecipherable if I hadn't heard it a thousand times before. \n\n*Pod sixty-thousand four-hundred seventy. Simulation complete. Maximum adrenaline output achieved. Beginning cycle again in 3...2...1...*\n\nWith a primal cry of horror I release my grip, beginning to fall. As I fall away I recognize the patterns of pipes and cylinders for one that I had seen many times in the tunnels I always run through: like that of a spider's web.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405819722","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj27omc","link_id":"t3_2b48oq","name":"t1_cj27omc","parent_id":"t3_2b48oq","retrieved_on":1434799956,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

As they walked past though, everybody averted their gaze, mumbling some excuse or other.\n\n“Fix me!” he screamed. “Make this darkness go away! Make me happy as the child I used to be!”\n\nHis throat hoarse, he sagged, head drooping.\n\n“Happy as a child, isn’t that how we’d all like to be?”\n\nThe man looked up and watched an old lady approach, the hook of a yellow umbrella over one arm, her legs bowed and thick around the ankles. \n\n“I never thought life would be this hard. I never thought people would be so indifferent.”\n\nThe woman’s face wrinkled as she smiled and nodded. She was short, when she reached him, and he could smell the soap she used and the scent she sprayed on her worn skin. \n\nSuddenly, she spread her arms wide, and without ceremony, clasped the young man in a warm embrace. Now the people passing glanced his way, curious about the strange couple embracing on the street. He felt awkward under their impassive stares.\n\n“Things always get better,” she told him, her voice #BADWORDS#led against his tattered old jumper.\n\nShe smiled as she let him go, chucking him under the chin. \n\n“After the rain there is always a rainbow,” she murmured before turning and walking away.\n\nHe stared, gobsmacked, watching her go, his gaze caught by the sway of her broad old arse as she made her way down the road.\n\nFace slack, he turned, pacing slowly as he fumed, the rage rising in him suddenly and wildly. This is what he had received for so long! These pla#BADWORDS#udes! These insufferable banalities! \n\nWhat did they really think?

{"archived":true,"author":"nhilante","body":"March 17 2019. 09:40am\n\nIt was about an hour too late when Taisa finaly managed to wake up, she had been drinking again. Hangovers come with a bad taste in your mouth but the bitterness  she felt was in her soul. 15 years ago today, her son had died in a car accident she knew she could have prevented had she not been drinking. She had made sure to not forget the date and the calender on top of her make-up table would have served it's purpose after just one more tick. March 17, check. Looking around the bedroom she saw that her husband had already left. The times when they used to kiss each other awake was long past. He kept telling her that he loved her still but Taisa could feel it was a lie whenever he half-heartedly hugged her. He would shake and turn around to hide his disgust leaving her alone to live in the guilt she couldn't shake off. One more day in this illusion of a life was beginning but it was all for the sake of Sarah. Sarah was their daughter, now turning 15. As a joke life had played on them a week after their son's death, she was born while Taisa was still lying unconscious, in a coma doctors tried to avoid answering questions about. When the brain is in the vegatable-like state that is the coma, the blood flow is prioritized to the organs that would ensure survival, but nature is not as kind as we think of it. Little Sarah in her mothers womb had less than half of the oxygen a health baby needed and was born with a condition where she could not speak or show emotion. They have been trying to make her feel happy but the lack of any form of confirmation from Sarah's side made it hard and just like that Taisa had lost all she had to live for in a week. When she woke up from the coma a year later, little Sarah did not know who she was and there was no connection between mother and daughter and her husband never forgave her for causing their son's death. ''Good #BADWORDS# morning'' she mumbled to herself. \n\nShe got up and washed the day old make up from her face but the darkness under her eyes was there to stay. As she limped to the kitchen she passed Sarah playing a video-game on Martin's old computer. Taisa touched Sarah' hair kindly but Sarah did not look back at her or even acknowledge her mother. Next to the monitor was the last picture of their son, taken maybe a week before the accident. He was smiling with his father in front of a GameShop branch just outside Vancouver. The two were inseperable and always played games together. The day the picture was taken they were waiting in line for the midnight release of a game called Half-Life 2 or something like that. Martin was holding a crowbar in his hands, a replica his father had painted to look like the one the main character used in the game. Maybe because of the picture or maybe because it was one of the only 2 games they had installed on that computer Sarah spent countless hours playing the Half-Life series over and over again. Taisa let her be, it was keeping Sarah calm. \n\nAbout an hour later Taisa was ready to leave for work when she heard tires screeching in front of their building. She rushed to the window to see if it was an accident and saw their car diagonally placed in the parking space as if it was left there in a hurry. A couple seconds later the doorbell rang furiously and she let her husband in. He looked as if he had been running but had a smile on his face. He did something that he hadn't done in the past 15 years and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek before running in to kneel next to Sarah. He took out a box from the plastic bag he had and revealed it to Sarah, waiting for her to respond in any way she could. Sometimes Sarah would hug them back, not because she knew it showed affection but she tried to imitate the actors she saw on tv and was curious what that physical contact signified. The box said Half-Life 3 on it. She reached for it and was lost in thought for a minute. ''Harvey what's the meaning of all this, i'm late for work, why are you here!'' asked Taisa but he would not break his look from Sarah. ''Just give it a second, this is important dear.'' ''Dear'', that's something she hadn't heard in a long time and it took her by surprise when Sarah pointed to the box art and back at the computer screen. She then slowly took the picture of Martin and held it with the box side by side. Her arms extended she turned to her mother and as if she was asking a question showed the two boxes to her. ''Maaaaaaaaarrr''. She couldn't speak but sometimes she tried to make noises that would get their attention. ''Maaarrrttt'' she tried even harder. Her father was now starting to tear up, his eyes ever fixed on their beautiful daugther who had not said a word the last 15 years. ''Honey'' she adressed Taisa, i think she likes these games because she thought the protagonist is her brother. When i saw that the third one was out i just had to come back to give it to her.'' ''Oh nonsense'' Taisa responded but her last word was distrupted by Sarah seemingly choking up. ''Maarrttin?'' she cried with tears in her eyes, she had never met him but it was his brother nonetheless. She must have been waiting for him to come back so she could finaly meet him. And with that Taisa felt happy like she has never been before. \n\nWith just a box of a video-game, her world was now at peace.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405840760","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj2etg3","link_id":"t3_2b5oy4","name":"t1_cj2etg3","parent_id":"t3_2b5oy4","retrieved_on":1434803388,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

You won't be satisfied in hearing though.\n\nI was lonely.  \n\nI made my life look fat fulfilled from the outside...of course it was empty on the inside.  Isn't that how it always goes?

I apologize to you all.  If there's any of you left.\n\nHere's another thing, my last thing I swear - HE'LL be back soon anyway.

HE saw that #BADWORDS# I swear to God Baby Jesus.\n\nThen he left and started killing everybody.  \n\nJesus HE moved fast. I watched the news stations get murdered.  You'd see the news anchors flash true panic in their eyes and voice, usually saying goodnight and goodbye.  You never saw the final execution however, as when the crew was killed so was the broadcast.  Well, at least that was true most of the time.\n\nI caught FOX News getting shredded on air.  Saw the faces and mouths that so ferociously spewed opinionated vomit at the camera get HIS biled acid spewed on their faces.  Anyone tuned in saw their trusted news personalities give one last performance of having their faces melted off on national television.  You can only do that sort of thing once.\n\n...\n\nHE'S back.  HE'S standing right in front of me.  Don't ask me how, but I know everyone is dead.  Every single person.  I can't be talking for you in my head, 'cause you're dead.  So I guess I'm talking for me.  Wow.  Just for me.  It's always been about them.  Small talk, no ruffled feathers.  But now there's no one else left.  \n\nThey're all gone.

{"archived":true,"author":"SHIVER_ME_WHISKERS","body":"Very nice! I just had a good idea for this too, so I hope you don't mind if I post my interpretation of it here too. Sorry for the length.\n\n'*Just one more time*' she thought.  If she could see him just one more time, she could be happy.  Of course, she wouldn't have much time; she was wanted by the police and her face was plastered all over every newspaper, but she didn't care. She could run away. He would always come.\n\nShe pulled up the collar of her overcoat, trying to seem incon#BADWORDS#uous, but it was a difficult task in such clothing. But, no one gave her a second glance when she waded through the busy streets of the city to her predetermined position. As she drew nearer to her destination, she knew she was also drawing nearer to him. Her heart began pounding quickly, as it always did prior to her perpetration of the killings. She thought she would have gotten used to it by now, which, in a way, she had.\n\nThe first time it happened, it as an accident. She had hit someone with her car, and was utterly shocked at the sight. Their mangled body, their blood soaked hair, their cracked lips. But as her mother used to say, 'Every cloud has a silver lining' and her silver lining appeared soon after.\n\nHe materialised as just that; a glowing silver outline. Then, it became a pitch black silhouette, out of which stepped the most stunningly handsome man she had ever seen. He wore and open black cloak with nothing else on his upper half, showing off his dull silvery skin. He was clean shaven with a chiselled jaw, a perfect nose and ruby eyes, literally. They were eyeball sized gemstones set in his eye sockets, yet they gazed upon her with the same look of any other possible suitor. They only held this look for a moment until he looked down. She longed for more of this stare; it was so hypnotically beautiful.  On his lower half, he wore simple black trousers and shoes. He held a six and a half foot tall scythe with a long, elegant blade which glinted in the summer moonlight.\n\nHe sighed, showing how tiresome he found the job. Still, he regained his composure and strode over to the corpse. He looked over it for a moment and then noted something down in a small black booklet he had retrieved from his trouser pocket. She staggered up to him in a daze, and tried to formulate a sentence, but only finding two words: \"Are you...\"\n\nHis face displayed an expression of pity, like he understood the shock she felt but couldn't fix it. \"Death?\" He finished for her.\n\nShe could only nod.  He folded up his notebook and shoved it back in his pocket. \"Yes, mortal. It is I, Death.\" His voice was deep and velvety, washing over her and giving her a euphoric, high feeling, which she felt for the duration she was in his presence. However, she couldn't help thinking how different he looked to how he was often portrayed: a skeleton, but she wasn't complaining.\n\nDeath looked up at the moon, as if checking the time and nodded to himself. \"I must go now,\" he said while touching the butt of his scythe to the corpse on the floor. Black smoke drifted up from the body and into the scythe until nothing of the person was left. \"But remember,\" Death continued, \"This was not your fault.\" His words were comforting, but before she could thank him or say anything to him at all, the black silhouette from which he emerged appeared again, and he stepped into it. He was gone.\n\nRemembering the first time they met made her feel warm and fuzzy, but she almost gagged at how cliche that sounded.  She remembered her feelings that night, as she lay alone in her double bed, missing the person who used to be by her side. She felt starved for attention and companionship, which may have been her reason for starting the murders. She knew it was the only way to see him, even if it was just for those fleeting seconds as he absorbed the essences of the dead bodies.\n\nThe first time was the hardest. But, seeing him afterwards calmed her down, made it all worth it.  The next time was easier and so on until she felt nothing each time. She had been desensitised, which was probably for the best.\n\nNow, as she crouched behind a dumpster in a dingy alley, she wondered what he would say, or what *she* would say to him. They rarely had a proper conversation, and over recent weeks, he had seemed to grow tired of seeing her, or at least her next to a body he had to recover. He told her to stop what she was doing, that it was unnatural, but she refused and said that she just wanted to see him, to which he merely shook his head and disappeared.\n\nShe would have thought about him and his muscular form for longer, but her thoughts were interrupted when some drunken idiot stumbled into the alley to take a piss against the wall. '*He'll do*' she thought.  She reached into her overcoat and brought out her go-to murder weapon: her silenced pistol. She took aim directly at the back of his head and fired. His body went rigid for a moment and then he collapsed to his knees and eventually toppled over, #BADWORDS# still in hand.\n\nA childish grin grew on her face. He would soon arrive and she could feel the high she got from him once more. The feeling was unparalleled. Nothing could match it; not coke, not meth, not heroin. She began to shake with excitement and would soon lose control over herself if he did not show.\n\nSoon enough though, the silhouette appeared and out he walked, but his expression was one she hadn't seen before. It was anger. He took no notice of her as he stomped past her, absorbed the body's essence and was about to re-enter the portal before she caught his shoulder. \"Wait! What's wrong? I just want to see you, can't you understand that?\" She pleaded.\n\nHis jaw tightened. \"You may want to see me, but you can't become a serial killer just for this. It isn't right. This is a love which will have to remain unrequited.\" \n\n\"But don't you feel it? There's something between us!\"\n\n\"Of course I feel it! But you can't do this! You **will** get caught and you'll spend the rest of your life in prison, where you will never get to see me.\" She had never seen him act like this; he had always been so composed. \"I'm sorry Katherine, but it can't and won't work. You must stop.\"\n\n\"Please, there has to be a way!\"\n\nWhen she said this, he looked down, deep in thought. \"There...there is. But you can't.\"\n\nNow, she was determined to make it work with Death. \"Yes, Death, I can. What is it?\"\n\nA small smile crept to his lips. He slid close to her until he was less than a foot away from her. He reached down and took hold of her right hand, which held her pistol. His hand was cold but ensured safety, so Katherine did not resist when he brought the gun to her head, his thumb on the trigger. \"This is it\" he said, slightly excited as well. Katherine nodded  signalling she was ready. This way, she might be able to spend more time with him  even be by his side for eternity. She didn't know what her a death held, but she welcomed it.\n\nDeath pulled the trigger.\n\n\nWhew, that turned out longer than expected! :D Hope it was ok, as this was my first post to this sub. I'd also like to point out that the quality may not be good for two reasons:\n\n1) I don't have much writing experience \n\n2) I'm pretty young (early teens)\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1405982131","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj3uz8r","link_id":"t3_2bbx97","name":"t1_cj3uz8r","parent_id":"t3_2bbx97","retrieved_on":1434828737,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}

{"archived":true,"author":"hedgehogz","body":"The sun was shining through the white curtains on the other end of my room. The rays hit my face, gently urging me to start the day. Didn't the sun know by now that I hated starting the day? My dreams were better than my real life - they felt more real than being alive, anyways.\n\nI stretched and slid my legs off the side of the bed, but something felt different. My feet usually rested flat on the ground, but this morning, my toes just barely grazed the carpet. *What the hell?* I looked down and gasped. My long, hairy, manly legs were now soft and feminine. And – wait a minute – were those #BADWORDS#? *Do I have #BADWORDS#?* My small hands grasped them firmly. I squeezed them, making sure this was real. *Am I still asleep? I must still be dreaming.*\n\nStanding up, realized I had to be at least five inches shorter than I had been the night before. *This isn't happening. There's no way this is real.* I walked over to my mirror, and a young woman I didn't recognize was looking back at me. She resembled me, sort of, but actually look a lot more like my mother. Blonde, brown eyes, thin, but fit. I touched my face, and the girl looking back at me did the same.\n\n*There's no way. I'm dreaming, right? I've got to be dreaming.* I walked over and bent down in front of the mirror. My eyes, I realized, looked exactly like hers. She even had a speck of hazel in her left iris, just like I did. I began to cry. My hands ran up and down *my* body, along *my* face, and through *my* hair, which now fell past *my* delicate shoulders. I opened my mouth to speak, and a high pitched, female voice came out.\n\n“Finally”, she said. I said.\n\nI thought of all the times my parents had placed a birthday cake in front of me. *Make a wish*, they'd exclaim.   \nI thought of all the times my sister picked a dandelion for me, holding it out towards me. *Make a wish*, she'd say.   \nI thought of all the times I laid in bed next to my girlfriend, and her fingers grazed my cheeks as she'd reach for a fallen eyelash, placing her index finger in front of my lips. *Make a wish*, she'd whisper.   \nI thought of all the times I walked around at night, when sleep refused to ease my mind. When I would sob as I looked up to the sky, until I found the brightest star. *Make a wish*, it would say.  \n\nIt was the same wish every time.  \n\nEach time I watched the candles flicker out, it was this.  \nEach time I watched my eyelash blow away, it was this.   \nEach time I watched the dandelion seeds dance through the breeze, it was this.   \nEach time I watched the star flickering back at me, laughing at my wish because it knew it would never come true, it was this.   \nEach time, it was this. It was to wake up in the right body. It was to be a girl. \n\nIt was this, every single time.   \n\n“Erin!”\n\nMy mother's voice startled me as it rang up the stairs. I thought, at first, she'd said Aaron, and my heart sank. It was the name I had been called all my life that never quite seemed to suit me. That never felt like my name. Years ago, I'd began to refer to myself as Erin. It was such a slight change that no one except me noticed, but as small as it was, at least it was something that felt right.\n\n“Erin!”\n\nI closed my eyes, waiting to wake up. Waiting to here her call for her son, Aaron. Not her daughter...\n\n“ERIN!”\n\n...her daughter, Erin. I smiled. I laughed. A girlish, happy laugh. A free laugh. The right laugh.\n\n“Coming, Mom!” my new voice escaped from my throat. I smiled again. I ran downstairs, for once, excited to start my day, and not wishing to fall back into dreamland. For once, I felt happy to be alive.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406063287","downs":0,"edited":"1406075196","gilded":0,"id":"cj4tvbu","link_id":"t3_2bfdlm","name":"t1_cj4tvbu","parent_id":"t3_2bfdlm","retrieved_on":1434847246,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}
{"archived":true,"author":"MechTerrier","body":"I ruled out hallucination after a short while. Ate dinner, slept a good ten hours, no alcohol or other mind-altering substances recently. I guess I could have had a massive brain tumor or something, but I wouldn't be able to check that out until I got to the doctor's office anyway.\n\nSo, why was I staring at myself, another version of me, other-me - talking to my parents?\n\nNext possibility: still asleep? Definitely possible, but I never perfected the whole \"lucid dreaming\" or \"I can wake myself up whenever I want\" techniques, so I couldn't confirm that either.\n\nThird possibility: I have a win I never knew about, or a clone. Why not have a listen, since possibilities 1 &amp; 2 could become true at any time by 1) Dying of brain failure (how does a brain tumor kill you... happened to my grandfather but I didn't bother to learn exactly how it worked) or 2) waking up. I tiptoed up to the door to pursue option 3.\n\n\"I think I'm just going to head back to the apartment,\" other-me said. My parents looked surprised.\n\n\"We thought you were staying this weekend,\" grumbled Dad.\n\n\"Are you feeling OK?\" added Mom. Other-me actually looked a bit queasy.\n\n\"Not feeling great, Mom. Thanks for dinner yes#BADWORDS#ay, and I'll see you guys next weekend.\" Not a twin. He seemed to have my memories as well, or at least some of them. Not just a physical clone, then.\n\nAlmost too late, I realized he was going to come right through my eavesdropping-door. Fortunately I knew all the noisy spots on my parents' wood floor and hopped softly around them. I slipped out the back door and raced behind the garage. Crouching behind the compost pile, I awaited other-me's exit. What exactly did I want to do? Plenty of time to figure that out later. Or option 1 or 2 might be true, and I might die or wake up.\n\nHe didn't disappoint, walking out the back door moments later and locking up dutifully behind him just like I would. Other-me unlocked the garage and emerged with my bicycle. I decided to go flank myself around the other side of the block. 'Anytime I want to wake up would be fine,' I thought and chuckled a bit crazily as I reached my ambush point.\n\nOther-me was just starting to pick up speed when I jumped out from behind a tree, shouting, \"Surprise!\" Wish I could have thought of something snappier. It turned out to not really matter, though, since he could not have been any more surprised. Poor other-me crashed off his bike with a \"Jesus Christ!\" Going by instinct, I helped me up.\n\nI watched with a mixture of amu#BADWORDS#t and fascination as other-me went through the exact same thought process as I had earlier.\n\n\"Am I hallucinating?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" I said, frowning.\n\n\"Yeah, can't see any reason why I would. Unless I'm about to have a massive aneurysm or something.\"\n\n\"I was thinking brain tumor but clearly we're along the same lines here.\" I smiled.\n\nOther-me now furrowed his brow and bit his lip nervously. \"Dreaming, then? I don't normally have dreams this vivid though.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" I sized myself up. Other-me had the same poor fashion sense (actually, some of my exact clothes) and underweight build, but otherwise actually looked healthy. More or less normal. A normal as you'd expect an undiscovered clone to be? Other-me, also brooding, raised an eyebrow at me.\n\n\"Long-lost twin?\"\n\n\"No, man. I've been with Mom and Dad my whole life.\"\n\n\"So have I, though.\" We both narrowed our eyes at this. I broke the brief silence.\n\n\"I think you're my clone. Now, I'm not sure who put you here, and why, but - \" Other-me cut me off.\n\n\"Who says you're not the clone? We've established that we share at least partial memories, personality, and even possessions. You could just as easily have been placed here by whatever shady futuristic genetic engineering company did this.\"\n\nOf course other-me was right. I nodded sagely. \"You are correct sir. But this is freaking me out horribly, so I think we should get to the apartment.\"\n\nOther-me smiled agreeably. \"I knew I'd be reasonable if I ever cloned myself, just didn't expect someone else to do it first. You're equally right, though. Let's head back.\"\n\n\"I do believe you're on my bike, me.\"\n\n\"Not if you're the clone. Then it was mine all along.\" Other-me laughed at this and I had to join him.\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" I admitted, \"let's just walk then. You know, this could be kind of awesome. I mean, we do have to figure out how this happened...\"\n\n\"Right, and we have what, $1200 saved? I guess this is what they mean by having a rainy day fund.\"\n\n\"Well OK we haven't exactly managed our money the best. But while we investigate - dude! Best roommate ever.\"\n\n\"Agreed. I'll take the couch.\"\n\n\"I knew I would say that.\" We both laughed stupidly.

{"archived":true,"author":"Molly-Millions","body":"I stood in the doorway to a small, modern hospital room. The nurse was adjusting something on a very complicated display next to his bed. Everything was sleek and quiet.\n\n\n“Hospitals were so different when we were children. When I knocked him out of a tree when we were seven we had to wait in the emergency room for hours before they set the bone and covered his forearm in plaster. He said he’d never forgive me for missing out on all that swimming. Now we can regrow whole skeletons in a matter of weeks.” I muttered.\n\n\nThe nurse looked up at me. “I’m sorry?”\n\n\n“It’s not important. How is he?”\n\n\n“Mr. Caudill is resting comfortably. Are you Dr. Turner?”\n\n\n“Bethany, please.”\n\n\nThe young man smiled warmly.\n\n\n“He’s been asking for you, Bethany.” He motioned to a chair next to the bed.\n\n\nI sat and ran a hand over my hair.\n\n\n“You’re still wearing that awful perfume. I could smell it as you were clacking down the hallway.”\n\n\n“My late husband loved this perfume.” I crossed my legs and smoothed my skirt.\n\n\n“Husband number three or four?”\n\n\nI smirked. “Three.”\n\n\nHe took a deep, ragged breath and closed his eyes. My smile faded.\n\n\n“Jasper…” I trailed off.\n\n\n“Oh, don’t get all sentimental on me now. How’s the new board?”\n\n\n“Young and enthusiastic. Full of big ideas.”\n\n\n“They always are. You remember us at that age?”\n\n\n“I remember spending hours plotting to dismantle your life piece by piece.”\n\n\n“So, nothing’s changed.”\n\n\nI shook my head. “Nothing’s changed.” I paused. “How are your grandchildren?”\n\n\n“Wonderful.” He gestured at a collection of photographs beside the bed. “My youngest granddaughter just started at Yale. That makes them all Ivy Leaguers.”\n\n\n“You always were a snob.”\n\n\nHe gave a gentle shrug. “Yours?”\n\n\n“Jeffery is in his third year at Duke and Georgia is in Africa with the State Department.”\n\n\n“So she’s why you’ve been opening your checkbook to those idiots in Washington.”\n\n\nIt was my turn to shrug. “She’s a smart woman and the policy changes she wants made are good ones. I’m just helping things along.”\n\n\nHe nodded. Someone in soft shoes passed out in the hallway.\n\n\n“About the company. My daughter, Meghan, is going to take over and I…” I waved a hand dismissively.\n\n\n“Our business has always been our own, Jasper. She’ll get no trouble from me.”\n\n\nHe visibly relaxed. “Thank you for that.”\n\n\nI glanced down and chipped at my manicure. “So how long until I’m rid of you for good?”\n\n\nHe gave a barking laugh. “You never were one for talking around a subject. A few hours. Maybe a day if I’m lucky.”\n\n\nI nodded. “I always thought somehow that we would…”\n\n\n“I know. Me as well. You’ve challenged and infuriated me in every way since the day we met. You were always going to be the great love of my life or the death of me. And now...” He gestured to the stark, blank walls and the humming machines.\n\n\nMy breath caught in my throat and I stood, offering him my hand. We shook.\n\n\n“It’s been a pleasure, Bethany.”\n\n\n“Goodbye, Jasper.”\n\n\n“Goodbye.”","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406136614","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj5mppv","link_id":"t3_2bh7f5","name":"t1_cj5mppv","parent_id":"t3_2bh7f5","retrieved_on":1434861456,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

They will be reborn into our civilization as we show them into the future, beyond conflict. I was elected to lead this colony, so I shall be the one who simultaneously ends humanity and protects a Martian future. ” \n\nThe command room was nearly silent, only the buzzes of the monitors and computers. If you listened close, you might be able to hear jaws lock and teeth bite into lips. Fallon was elected to lead and would take the most of the emotional brunt for the rest of his life but what should have been soft light on the faces of the small amount of Martian confidants felt instead like a hot burning judgment. Each of the monitors was a serene and peaceful Earth. The population knew nothing of how close the end was. \nOn just one of the screens in the pacific region was a young American couple out on their 4 year old Elizabeth’s first beach adventure,  and oh did she come on the right day. A beach to themselves in the waning sun, with her little pink spade and flowery pale she occasionally called back to her parents keeping their toes dry a little further up from the  construction site. Momma had already accidentally “messed up” her castle by making a tower a little too tall. Daddy was the foreman over-seeing now. \n\n“Liz!

Almost done!” \n\n“Okay.” He resigned; he could deal with a little longer as he pulled his love closer. He could feel something in the air. It connected their three hearts together in this single moment. The sky glowed softly as if accepting their love as well and smiling back in its’ oranges and reds.\n\n“OKAY!” Elizabeth yelled, “Done!” Elizabeth cheered as she ran through the waves one last time to wash off before running to her parents, already embraced but readying room for their little. “How is it daddy?” She asked, her eyes wide and blue like the ocean.\n\nTears burned the cheeks of the ex-patriots, now Martians. The button’s pressing seemed slower than a single falling grain of sand. An eternity in this moment.

Please provide some criticism/feedback, I'll change it accordingly!\n\nI stood looking out the window in the Lincoln Bedroom, drinking a Coke and rum, going over mentally what had happened the past several months. It had been a whirlwind in the media since the previous president was impeached on charges of corruption and bribery. I remember President Anderson calling me the night before the court announced their findings, and I’ll never forget the advice he offered me. “Kid, before you take office, I want to offer you some advice. There are good politicians then there are bad politicians. Try to be a little bit of both to appease the public. You’re the future of the country kid. Godspeed.” My nerves were on edge; I have seen what the media can do to a man. Certainly the Republicans were waiting for me to make a mistake and slaughter me alive. Suddenly I hear someone knocking at the door. I go over to the door, thinking its one of the Secret Service guys, checking in as usual. I think “Oh great, it’s the security chief coming in for the 10th time tonight asking me if everything is to my liking”. It’s my wife, the proud new First Lady of the United States. She says the kids are asleep in their new “big person” bedrooms, and they can’t wait to explore more of the “big new house” tomorrow.

His fingers were heavy as his arms sagged and hands lay on the dirty floor. He felt he couldn’t get enough air in his lungs and every breath was laboured and long, setting his heart racing.\n\nEyes dull, he turned his gaze to the scrap of paper he had brought in with him, and the pen with which he had intended to write his last words. Last words, he wondered, through the haze of depression and anger. As if I ever had any words worth writing. As if I ever… \n\nHe didn’t even bother finishing the thought. Worthless, he told himself. Useless, just a thing that takes up space and food and drink that would be better given to someone else. Someone good. Decent. Someone who would leave beauty and love in their wake, not misery and filth.\n\nThe slats of the blinds threw shadows upon him, stripes of dark and light on his legs, and creeping slowly up his torso. Soon, his wife would be home. His wife. He closed his eyes as he thought of her. A saint, an ever-loving, ever-patient woman who ought to welcome his passing. \n\nBut she wouldn’t. He opened his eyes and gazed at the razor. If she were here now, she would plead with him, cry at him, beg him to consider. Her warm hands, she’d lay them on his face and smooth back his messy hair.

Blood kissed the blade greedily, and he watched the colour trickle down the white of his hand.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\nIt seemed a stupid thing to say. If he were truly sorry, he wouldn’t have done it, would he?\n\n“Forgive me.”\n\nHe remembered a quote, in the hazy depths of his memory; better to ask forgiveness than ask permission. She would forgive him. Eventually, after years of wondering why, and wondering what she could have done better for him, she would forgive him. He didn’t need to ask.\n\n“Even with your love, your wonderful, amazing, selfless love, the world was too painful a place for me. Too callous, too real, too rough. Each time I fell, you raised me again. Each time I cried, you kissed the tears away. I love you. I love how hard you tried but I am not strong enough. My heart is too broken, my soul is too shattered. This is the only way I can get through this. This is the only way out for me.

Wolf had already picked off the two guards on duty from the hill but it was down to him to finish the job. They'd deliberated for hours how it was going to be done, and by the time they had decided to finish him in his house he was already on the move. Tracking him was difficult but Zero had come through as Zero always did. He hit the ground hard as a spotlight drifted past, praying that they would not recognize him. There was no reason to need to pray, Wolf had done his job and the guard in the tower had landed with neck snapped in half. As he walked past he noticed the bullet hole through his skull, and another one spewing hot blood onto the gravel around the tower. Mercy, he contemplated. *3.2 Billion Dollars* was the amount promised to whoever managed to kill the oil magnate. *I have ordered so many to their deaths. It is only fitting and right that I order mine own* the old man had wheezed in the video. Another thud seemed to boom out as another guard hit the ground, it was much quieter, but to him it seemed like a gunshot piercing the compound. He darted quickly into the kitchen. Zero had found the blueprints to the compound easily, well, easily for Zero, difficult for the rest. A solitary chef gazed at him with eyes wide open at the man who had just so rudely barged in. The man brought his lips to his fingers as he pointed a silenced pistol at the chefs face, which quickly brought his lips together and a thick swallow down his neck. The man crept through the kitchen like a cat, it was what he had always been good at, it was all he knew. He peered through the keyhole to note the guards in the room, one, just like Zero had promised, to the left of the door. He grabbed a nearby pot and violently threw it against the wall, the room echoed with the crash of the metal against the concrete walls. The guard burst into action with feigned professionalism and opened the door, flustered and pointing his gun at the chef. *Always check your corners*, the words of his mentor echoed in his ear. Luckily, this guard did not have the same luxury of having such a teacher and his insolence was rewarded with a swift punch in the neck and temple, knocking him out masterfully. Satisfied, the man walked through the door and left the chef gaping in bemu#BADWORDS#t.\n\nThe corridors of the compound were empty, the man supposed that the old man had been too stubborn to consider anyone clever enough to get inside the compound. He floated through the corridors like a ghost, or more fittingly, like the angel of death. He came to a halt outside a wide door adorned with Cherubs playing lazily with their bows and looking rather innocent. As the man burst through the door with ferocity he apologized thoughtfully in his mind for the innocence of theirs he was so ready to ruin. As he entered the room with adrenaline pumping through his veins he quickly noted that there was only one man in the room. \"And did you check your corners?\" the old man asked him in the very same way that a teacher talked to his students. \"Of course I did, father\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406186875","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj6a5tf","link_id":"t3_2bj5bg","name":"t1_cj6a5tf","parent_id":"t3_2bj5bg","retrieved_on":1434873115,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

The trail curved a bit, following the river. I could smell new blossoms on the trees. It wasn't *quite* summer.\n\nAs I ran I noticed a split up ahead. I had never noticed that before. It was unusual, too. The main trail curved sharply to the right, following the river bank. The split, however... \n\nAs I got closer I could see it remained straight. It was broken, and unpaved. *Kids*, I thought. It looked like it probably went straight down to the river bank.\n\nSomething about it was intriguing, though. It was shrouded in brush, low hanging trees covering it like a tunnel. It was early in the day still, the sun was high over head. I decided to see where it went.\n\nI slowed to a walk as I approached. Sweat dripped down my forehead. I looked to my right, and didn't see anyone. I looked behind me. I was alone on the trail. Looking back toward the path, I took a few steps forward and into the brush.\n\nIt was dark, surprisingly. Much cooler than the main trail. The trees overhead created a canopy, and I had to slightly bend to walk through. I made my way down. I expected to be at the river bank any second.\n\nHowever, the path took a sharp fall. I slid down on my butt, and saw that the path led to an underground tunnel. I could hear the river, but couldn't see it. At the mouth of the tunnel, I looked back.\n\nI could hear someone calling my name. Or maybe calling someone's name. My ears were playing tricks on me. I shook my head, and looked into the tunnel. It wasn't far to the end. I could see the faint light on the other side. I was a little disoriented; I expected the river here. \n\nI heard the voices get closer. I had a feeling of excitement in my chest, and for some reason was nervous about getting caught. I wasn't doing anything wrong. I looked back into the tunnel. The ground was soft and warm, and slightly damp. I sank to my hands and knees and made my way into the mouth of the tunnel.\n\nThe voices were loud now; they had to be just at the edge of the path. If I had noticed it, surely they would too. I couldn't quite hear who they were calling for, perhaps a lost animal. I felt a sudden pang of sadness. I wish my husband were here. He loves adventures.\n\nIt wasn't far to the other side. I decided I would have a look, and let my husband know tonight what I found. I bet he'd love to check it out after work.\n***\nThe doctor sighed. The long, melancholy sound of the alarm shot through my body like shock waves.

{"archived":true,"author":"JackSkye","body":"The enormous doors unnerved the council of dwarves that marched beneath them. Unlike other dragons, the dragon known to them as Goldtooth had not stolen his castle, but had it built especially for him by quarry dwarves from the east. It was not built of the dark gray granite of the mountain behind the castle, but rather of a silky, sandy stone from the south.\n\nHelboor added up the cost of such an undertaking in his head, estimated the size of the castle and the number of quarry dwarves it would take to build it quickly, and came up with a vast sum. Suddenly, he worried their offer might not be enough. \n\nBut he did not voice his concerns to the others. They simply marched in what seemed to be an endless hallway for their short legs until they reached a second set of doors.\n\nThe dining hall was as large as a small village, from Helboor's reckoning. The table was a jade marble with golden veins running through it's surface. Eight seats had been prepared for the eight dwarf nobles, each one unique and richly decorated as a kings throne. Helboor's was encrusted in sapphires and dripping turquoise gems and had tiny rivers of I diamonds set in a mosaic to represent the sea and the rivers. It was meant to look like his home, and he realized with a glance that the other thrones were much the same. \n\n\"Do you approve of the craftsmanship?\" the voice rumbled from the walls, coming from everywhere. \n\n\"Y-yes,\" Helboor replied. \"It is magnificent.\"\n\n\"Please take them when you leave. They are my gifts to you.\"\n\nOn the opposite of the table was a vast darkness, like a cave that had been pressed into the middle of the fine palace. A shadow shifted in the darkness, and the dragon peered it's head forward. Terror filled Helboor's veins. His teeth were as long as spears, his mouth must easily crush four or five cattle at a time, and the heat rising from his nostrils was more intense than their caravan campfires. \n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Goldtooth. You are most generous.\"\n\nGoldtooth did not have a gold tooth, Helboor realized. His scales were dark green, almost black, and he was not as majestic or sparkling as some of the artwork had depicted him. He was all beast, and all terrifying. \n\n\"Not at all, Master Helboor. Now, you come to speak, business, do you not?\n\nIt was unnerving to hear the dragon without seeing his lips move. But dragons spoke through magic, not through their own lips. Helboor nodded and drew himself up as high as he could in the throne. \n\n\"We are here to hire you to eliminate the knight Sir Thiery.\"\n\nGoldtooth's dark eyes narrowed. \"The supposed Hero of Damark? And why would you have me kill such a man?\"\n\n\"He has many brave tales, that is true, Mr. Goldtooth. But he is also a cruel man. In the war, he was known to burn down defenseless villages, #BADWORDS# women, steal from children, and leave the common folk devastated. None of these tales reach the ears of other humans, and they worship him as hero. With the king ill, and with only a daughter, we fear that he will wed the girl and become king.\"\n\nSulphur and steam rose from Goldtooth's nose. \"And why does that concern the dwarves?\"\n\n\"He...likes to ...hunt and eat folk not of his own kind.\"\n\n\"He eats dwarves?\"\n\n\"And...fairies. Elves. Centaurs, mermaids, tree walkers...if he becomes king, we fear he will make it legal, or worse, mandatory to hunt us all down and be eaten. We are strong people, but the humans have grown in size these many years, and we do not know if we can stop them.\"\n\nGoldtooth rolled a double laugh, both from his physical belly and his magical voice. \"I have eaten many of those, dwarf.

Luckily I had a backup generator and a full tank of natural gas.  Conserving my supply wasn't hard. I'd run the \"genny\" every few hours. just long enough to keep the freezer cold and to cook for myself.  I had no idea what was happening in the outside world. But ignorance isn't always bliss.  My lack of knowledge only drove me to imagine, to create; to invent.  I pictured bodies rotting in the streets, hospitals full of the dead.  A barren wasteland of abandoned city streets was likely all that remained of civilization.  \n\nI was a prepper.  Since 9/11/01 I'd decided to not be caught off guard.  I had been right.  When the disease hit I was home.  I caught the warning signs early.  The news told of a virus in China killing hundreds.  Slowly the death-toll and infection numbers rose, then came reports of cases outside China.  At first they were limited to Eastern Asia, but of course it spread.  Like a wildfire it spread throughout the world until it was finally in America.  I stayed inside, locked the door and waited.\n\nAfter ten weeks I was running out of food.  Do I dare? Venture outside.  What could be waiting for me?\n\nI was officially out of food and water.  It was now or never. Outside, in the middle of the street was a large crate with a parachute d#BADWORDS# across it.  On the side, the crate said CDC.  I removed the twisted tangled chute and read a message on the top of the crate:  \"Inside is the immunization for the Ryno-Flu virus...\"  I opened the crate, needing to look no further.

I'm sitting near God, and am about to doze to sleep leaning against his throne...\n\n\n\nGod launches himself rather abruptly onto his feet, snapping me out of my reverie, and yells \"Gotcha!! Welcome to heaven. You'll fit right in.\" He snaps his fingers, transforming my clothing from bullet riddled bloody rags into the white silken robes of the citizens of Heaven. Light as a feather, but perpetually warm like they were always just pulled out of the dryer. For lack of any better response I start laughing almost as much as God was when he feigned his death. I wipe the tears from my ears and reach my hand out towards God as if to shake his hand. Much to my surprise he grasps my arm just beyond my wrist firmly. It's then I notice the sheer size of his hands. His thumb easily touches the opposing fingers on his hand, around my arm. I return his firm grip and shake firmly a few times before releasing.\n\n\"That's a good joke Father, I'll have to share that one with the guys when they show up.

{"archived":true,"author":"TheDemonOfRazgriz","body":"\"Admiral, the enemy fleet is moving three frigates over to Sector 5b. The Resolute is getting flanked and won't make it another minute out there.\" The battle over the Quarth System for control of its central planet rich in Uranium deposits was already underway. The mighty fleets of the Republic of Unified Systems engaged the Separatist CIS forces in a deadly space assault. \"Helmsman! Move the Essex 167 degrees, full speed. Radio operator, tell the Resolute to move to Sector 6f while we cover their escape!\" Admiral Yularen started to move towards the holographic war table when the three Separatist frigates began to open fire, their bomber squadrons moving in towards the command bridge. The Essex, the Republic's largest, and most powerful capital ship, lead the attack against the CIS blockade fleet. Running to the holo-table, Yularen hailed one of his flight leads, in command of his most elite group of fighter pilots. \"Oddball, this is the Admiral, return to the ship, and cover us from the enemy bombers as the Resolute makes her escape.\" The helmeted face showed no emotion, as Oddball looked down at his gauges, heading over to the Republic flagship. The guns on the starboard side swiveled to face the new threat, firing a salvo of laser bolts. Anti-aircraft guns opened up as the enemy bombers flew in to drop their deadly payload. Soon, Republic interceptors engaged these bombers, weaving in and out of the thick flak that surrounded the ship. \"Admiral, the three frigates are pulling back, and the Resolute has fallen back to Sector 6f, as ordered, sir.\" \n\nThe Admiral walked to the edge of the deck, and observed the ensuing battle. To the right of the Essex, the starcraft carrier Britannia opened its hangar bay doors, battered starfighters returning home to rearm and refit for the next furball. To the left, a Ticonderoga class battle cruiser had launched a flurry of anti-ship missiles, no doubt headed to the heart of the enemy fleet, while its laser batteries fired at the nearest CIS frigates and cruisers. All around them, pilots of starfighters and bombers were fighting their own personal battles, many of which met their own personal defeat. The Republic fleet steamed onwards, the wrecks of destroyed CIS and Republic ships making perfect concealment for the smaller Republic frigates to launch their missiles. The CIS's largest battlecruiser, the Devastator, fired a huge ion pulse, slamming into three Republic frigates and countless starfighters. The Ticonderoga class battlecruiser moved ahead of the Essex, all twenty of its laser batteries firing at the Devastator, moving between the ionized frigates and the Devastator itself. \"Admiral, that battlecruiser is covering our frigates, your orders sir?\"  \n\n\"Get Oddball's squadron here, and launch the landing ships. Have our fighter squadron cover the landing ships as we evacuate the frigates. The pilots in the fighters are long gone without their life support. In the meanwhile, I want the Helmsman to bring us under that battlecruiser, and maneuver the Essex allowing our portside guns to open fire. I want the starboard guns to cool off before we use them again.\" Swinging underneath the battlecruiser, the menacing delta shaped Devastator pummeled the cruiser , which soon fell out of formation, its engines badly damaged. \"Sir, the friendly cruiser has fallen out of formation, I think its going down.\" The Admiral's face twisted up, soon resigned to his fate. \"Commander, bring it out.\" Without answering, the Commander turned to his computer screen, opening the huge panel on the top of the ship. A bright blue light emanated from the now open panel, ray shielding keeping the open ship's weapons bay oxygenated and pressurised. With ground crews running around the large, mysterious weapon, the Admiral looked in awe as the weapon rose and poked out of the ray shielding. \n\nThe barrel, almost as long as the ship itself, swung around, aiming at the Devastator. Without this weapon, the Essex had no chance of taking on the Devastator, its massive laser batteries pounding away at the ships shields. \"Sir, the first H.E.L.L shell has been loaded and is ready to fire.\" With a nod, the Commander gave the all clear, and the massive cannon recoiled as the shell was propelled through space, slamming into the Devastator. The shell struck the dull gray plating, exploding on contact, a red, fiery explosion consuming the right half of the ship. The right side of the ship disappeared, forcing the powerful nuclear reactor into a total meltdown, careening back towards its lines. The reactor blew, disintegrating 30% of the CIS fleet. With their most powerful battlecruiser gone, the remaining fleet jumped into hyperspace. \"With a weapon like this, more good men are bound to die, regardless of who they fight for.\"  The Admiral seemed to be talking to no one in particular, but the crew on the bridge could all feel the Admiral's sorrow as the weapon's destructive power wiped out the CIS flagship. His brother, a Separatist himself was commandeering that ship. This deadly civil war has claimed thousands of lives at his command, but Admiral Yularen truly felt the horrors of war.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406442526","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj8yv81","link_id":"t3_2bu1f8","name":"t1_cj8yv81","parent_id":"t3_2bu1f8","retrieved_on":1434920486,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Everything about the world around was bellowing nostalgia, the smell of the ocean, the cool air, the movement of the boat on the waters surface. And yet the memories that came along with it were blurry and messy with motion and noise. A problem she hasn't been able to rectify through out growing up.\n\n\"I asked you a question, sweetheart.\" \n\nSuddenly she was back. Back to this grim fairy tale that she named life. The warm thoughts her mind conjured were now replaced with a rude man.\n\n\"Well?\" The man asked as Cathyn turned around. \n\nCathyn took a deep breath and let all the stress vent out through a single breath \"This is the place.\"\n\nThe rude man, Benny, sat there on the right of the left of the boat in his deep black suit and red tie, drinking from a bottle of some kind of whisky. Cathyn couldn't tell, nor cared really. He wasn't exactly good looking, but not ugly. His face was a contrast onto itself, as he had think black eyebrows on a overly tanned face.\n\n\"Be careful with that, you don't want to be passed out before we even get there.\" The woman on the right said. She was Lyca. She was different form Benny in the sense that while he was upfront with his rudeness, she kept her true side hidden at all times. She always had an agenda and would betray the trust of a 15 year old girl just to get what she wanted. She wore a wool coat covering a short black dress. Cathyn envied the sheer beauty of her, her calm face, her warm smile and her deep black hair that curled around her pale face.   \n\n\"Cathyn, honey, you'll catch cold if you stand there like that, come sit next to me.\" Lyca ordered.\n\nCathyn stumbled slightly. \"Um, is it okay if I stay here and look at Boreal as we approach?\"\n\nLyca's smile dropped a little as she bent forward slightly, putting her elbows on her legs. \"As long as we don't have another incident again, that's perfectly fine.\"\n\n\"Incident?\" A rapid voice came from the back of the boat. Suddenly Lyca turned her furious face towards the man in shadows.\n\n\"None of your concern.\" Lyca said coldly. \n\nUp until that point Cathyn thought he was just one of Lyca's henchmen. Now that he drew the attention towards himself, she could see the difference. For one he wasn't constantly trying to intimidate anything that moved. He didn't need to try. He was wearing an odd mask, the likes of which Cathyn had never seen before. It was a black blank slat with three green eyes in the middle forming a triangle pattern. Only a small bit of skin was sowing throughout his leather bound outfit. It almost had a sickly green tint to it.\n\nThe sound of a pumped shotgun shattered the silence, as Benny stood with said shotgun in hand. \n\n\"We're here\" Benny said as the man in the odd mask began to turn down the power of the motor of the boat. Slowly the boat went into shallow water and eventually the shore. Benny was the first to step off the boat into the damp sand.\n\nCathyn stood at the edge of the boat trying to figure out a way of getting down without sinking into the sand. Suddenly Benny grabbed her hand and helped her down. \"M'lady.\" He said as he helped her down. A few seconds later he did the same with Lyca. The man with the odd mask landed behind them.\n\n\"What's the plan now, Lyca?\" Benny asked.\n\nLyca turned towards Cathyn and bent down slightly to be on the same eye level as her. \"Sweety here is going to find us that castle, ain't ya?\"          ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406502028","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj9i0mf","link_id":"t3_2bw17n","name":"t1_cj9i0mf","parent_id":"t3_2bw17n","retrieved_on":1434930260,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

In fact because of this I almost never would've been the research type, had eyes for being a fire fighter instead.\"\n\nThe mans eyes light up, content in me biting into his small talk.\n\n\"Ah the services? Well can't speak for where your coincidences get you but our fire boys are somewhat of local heroes. Drink for free and all that - just not on duty.\" He winks.\n\nAs he waddles away to clean away another table, I focus on where I should know his face. Because it's not a nagging possibility; I know that face, but something here is wrong. I'm seeing the features but not the man, the podgy nose and greasy skin, wrinkled brow and missing teeth - all the corner pieces but not the puzzle. It nags me until I leave, and his face falls to the back of my mind behind the more pressing coincidence before me.\n\nI'm staring at a clock tower, attached awkwardly to a town hall painted white. I could take a picture of my view, as I see it right now, and hold it over a view of the town I grew up in and it would take sharp eyes to spot any sort of difference.\n\nIn fact, it took me a few bewildered minutes of looking around until I noticed them, the slight differences that threw me at first. For example, in my home town, Puxville, the clocks '3' has long since been absent from the clock face, whereas in this Puxville, the clock ticks without a '4'. Once this hit me, I saw it everywhere; and the Diner was no exception - in fact the diner was a test.\n\nMuch of my youth was spent wasting money on sickly drinks within my town's diner, and without me trying I've found the places interior tattoed into my head. From the outside, it was identical down to the name, 'Eatsville', a name equally bad in both towns. Walking inside, I was again thrown into uncanny valley with the upside down familiarity of the place; tables were in the opposite side of the room, as if mirrored. And instead of the jolly singing Barry taking my order was a larger, gruff gentleman.\n\nBut I knew his face, didn't I?\n\nWalking around the town I saw the same thing anywhere; everything big was the same, everything in it's right place, streets all going the same way, fountains in the middle of parks.\n\nSo why was everything so different? \n\nHouses were exactly where I'd grown up with them being, but their doors were coloured differently. Streets went where I knew they would, but all had each others names in a strange jumbled system - it was only when I visited the butcher, drawn to it by the faint sound of a man singing, that the distorted nature of this place truly set in.\n\nThere behind the counter, selling an old woman lamb, was a man singing cheerily to himself. It was wrong. That voice did not parody the hits of the month with the prices of meat, but with the prices of milkshake - and this shop wasn't filled with the air of artistic spectactle, but influenced by the booming presence of a large gruff man stood behind the counter.\n\n\nI didn't need to call out the man's name, the woman's playful compliment toward 'Barry's darling singing voice' told me all I had to know. Somebody had pressed shuffle on my town and somehow I'd stumbled right inside.\n\nAs I awkardly blocked prospective shoppers, mesmerised by the alternate reality I was struggling to comprehend, I heard the faint ringing of sirens in the distance, instinctively bringing my hand up to feel the uneven skin of my scar, and I began to wonder:\n\nWho else here is living the wrong life?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406507813","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cj9kjrf","link_id":"t3_2bwba3","name":"t1_cj9kjrf","parent_id":"t3_2bwba3","retrieved_on":1435463983,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

He had done this, of course, because he was in possession of one of the most valuable abilities in the world, and it would prove to be the only way to elude those powerful agencies which desired it. \n\nAt last Kirk was free to live the life of his dreams, and he supported this new life by hustling games of chess in the park. Kirk was really quite terrible at chess, but that was irrelevant since his opponents always chose his moves for him.\n\nMr. Sa#BADWORDS#e on the other hand was an exceptional chess player. He was in possession of a strange ability like Mr. Kirk, and though it didn't put him in danger of being kidnapped by megalomaniacs, his talent was still equally remarkable.\n\nMr. Sa#BADWORDS#e may as well have been able to push the wooden-pieces around with his hands as much as he liked, investigating various strategies and tactics before finally settling on the one he liked best. That is because Mr. Sa#BADWORDS#e's unique brain would involuntary visualize such thoughts as actually happening physically.\n\nWhile it had been a great inconvenience to him in early life, Sa#BADWORDS#e eventually was able to moderate these hallucinations and distinguish them from reality, mostly. Sometimes he forgot.\n\nIt seemed that destiny had brought them together.\n\n\"Now if I move the queen to c5 I would not only be pinning your knight to your king, but I'd be attacking the pawn at c4.\" Sa#BADWORDS#e explained, moving the pieces around.\n\nBut in reality, though they were several moves deep into the game, not a single piece had been physically touched. Kirk, deep into Sa#BADWORDS#e's mind, failed to notice, since he was experiencing Sa#BADWORDS#e's hallucinations as his own. He had been looking to hustle the poor guy, but found himself fascinated as Sa#BADWORDS#e began to explain chess theory to him in incredible depth.\n\nSa#BADWORDS#e too, was oblivious to the fact that he was actually sitting with his hands crossed and his mouth closed. To the onlookers it looked as if Mr. Kirk was having a one-sided conversation with a mute Sa#BADWORDS#e. It looked as if Sa#BADWORDS#e was completely ignoring him.\n\nThe onlookers had set up the game and were greatly looking forward to watching these two prodigies clash, for both were well-known among the hundreds that played in Central Park. Now they were now muttering impatiently among themselves, wondering when the game would start. They had already placed money on either of them.\n\n\"However, you'd be leaving the g2-pawn unguarded. I could sacrifice my Knight with Nxg2, and when you counter Kxg2, I can drive your king out into the open...\"\n\nKirk was nodding. \"Right, right...but what about moving the king back here...is that h8?\"\n\n\"No that's h1.\"\n\n\"Whoops, that's what I meant.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't work either, you'd be moving into check.\" Sa#BADWORDS#e wondered if Kirk was really as good as the others had been saying, or if someone was pulling his leg.\n\nFinally one of the onlookers who'd placed twenty-bucks on Mr. Sa#BADWORDS#e approached and slapped him on the back. \"Sa#BADWORDS#e-man! Are you nervous or something? Just run this guy over already.\" The man turned his gaze to Kirk and added: \"No offense guy.\"\n\nKirk wasn't offended, but when he looked down at the board he was in shock. The pieces were all in their rows, completely unmoved, except for a single white pawn that had at some point been knocked into the grass.\n\nSa#BADWORDS#e looked confused, he mussed his hair and then looked at Kirk. \"Were you...?\" He paused and stopped to rub his eyes, then looked back at Kirk who was now donning a growing expression of horror. \n\n\"I uh...\" Kirk replied lamely.\n\nThe onlooker looked between them with bent eyebrows, but his look of confusion could not match Sa#BADWORDS#e's.\n\n\"You were, weren't you?\" Sa#BADWORDS#e stated bluntly.\n\n\"No, of course not. What are you talking about?\" Kirk said, getting to his feet.\n\nBut Sa#BADWORDS#e hadn't said it out loud.\n\n\"I won't say a thing.\" Mr. Sa#BADWORDS#e promised with a thought.\n\nMr. Kirk said nothing, he pushed himself up from the table, stumbling before he found his feet, and awkwardly sprinted away into the trees. \n\n*Will I have to fake my death again?* Kirk wondered, but then decided he would trust the strange chess-player, though he would have to avoid Central Park in the future. *Looks like I'll be taking up poker after all.*\n__________________________________________________________\n**END**\n__________________________________________________________\n[More Stories.](http://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction4you)\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406613941","downs":0,"edited":"1406621771","gilded":0,"id":"cjas31p","link_id":"t3_2c030p","name":"t1_cjas31p","parent_id":"t3_2c030p","retrieved_on":1434952550,"score":144,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":144}

As he entered the room all were looking at him with angry faces. Him being late for the meeting for them was a sign of incompetence. These people held him responsible for this mess of a war, because the enemy they've met surprised them with seemingly impossible feats that in their opinion should have been known to them from preliminary intelligence he should have provided.\n\n\"Excuse me, mister president, chief of staff, generals. I was held by a final debriefing in my headquarters, to make sure I had the latest intel.\" The general sat in his chair among raging officers that scolded him with their gazes.\n\"You have many answers to give general Foresighn.\" The president said. \"And you better start giving them now. I trust you understand the gravity of the situation, and the problem our men are facing, and how unprepared we were for it.\" His lips, voice and eyes told what he thought of the commander of the intelligence corps and its function in the war. The general wanted to object, but he stopped himself, there is no benefit in that, not now. \"For the first question then: What the hell are we facing?\"\n\n\"This civilization we encountered seems quite primitive at a first glance. I stand by our analytics that says that these people are in the pre-industrial age in terms of technology.\"\n\"Stand by this?\" General Grover, head of the army slammed his fist on the table and rose from his seat. \"My men are getting slaughtered out there, they talk about fire balls, sudden blizzards and monsters that seem to be made of rocks. This is no primitive civilization!\"\n\n\"Why do you still think this way, General?\" the president calmed the raging officer with his hand and asked.\n\"Because all of the characteristics of that are there. They have primitive building technics and architecture; they mine mostly Iron, copper and stone; they are reliant on wood as the main energy source; they do not use or manufacture fire arms; they do not use any kind of engine, and do not utilize electricity, at least in the terms of utility for powering equipment. *They are by the very definition of the word, a pre-industrial age civilization*, and I stand by that, even now our analysis comes up with the same conclusion.\" Foresighn said. \"But there is more to them than Technology. If you will look over here…\"\n\nThe general pulled a small ball from his pocket and placed in on the table, the ball immediately illuminated the room with a picture of several charts. \n\"You see here the measurement of energy #BADWORDS#es measured from the start of our invasion. These #BADWORDS#es correlated with the strange events reported on the battle field, both in place and intensity. The strange thing is that these #BADWORDS#es seem to emanate from nowhere, as if the energy powering the blizzard is materializing from thin air. We cannot explain this phenomenon yet, but we must assume that it is caused by something. The only clue to that is what we call the small event, these are small #BADWORDS#es in energy that happen alongside or just before the bigger ones, and we suspect these trigger the seemingly supernatural events. Here you see the aerial photo of the first battle of war.\" The picture of the hologram shifts to show a giant patch of land covered with ally troops, smaller numbers of enemy infantry and cavalry that are armed with swords and lances, ant giant orbs of blistering fire that rains from the sky. \"The big event is quite apparent, but with it the a smaller event is recorded, and is located right here.\" The general pointed at a place on the image and it zoomed on a figure that stands with its hands trenched to the sides holding a strange stick in the left one. \"This is the exact spot of the small event, and it is a pattern that there's a smaller event located at a spot of these kinds of troops and several moments later a big event occurs, therefore we assume that these robed people trigger the bigger events.\"\n\n\"How do they do that without machines, how do they do it simply by the power of one individual?\"\n\n\"My people cannot explain this. As I have said, we do not know how they generate this energy, all we know is that these people do it.\" Foresighn said and pointed on the highlighted figure. \"And they should become the targets of our efforts.\"\n\nThe chanting intensified around the Witch king as he casted his seeing spell. The orb rose from its stand and shined in a pale light. He couldn't see a thing at first, but soon spots in the shining orb materialized into a form of one of the sky people. He looked much like one of the mundane folk, without any aura of magic, but he rides the metal monster that was shrieking across the heavens above the tower in an impossible speed.\nThe Witch king stopped the ritual, the orb dimmed and returned to its pedestal, he saw what he needed to see. After several moments he left the hall and headed to his throne.\n\n\"All hail the king!\" The guard declared as the witch king walked across the great hall and up the stairs to his throne. \n\n\"Heed me my good men\" He said and turned to his crowd, a moot of the high mage lords of his lands. \"I have been to the hall of seeing and witnessed the true nature of our enemy! They are completely devoid of magic, no touch of the arcane whatsoever!\" The hall filled with a humming sound of dozen voices speaking in amazement. \"We were all amazed with the sky people!\" The king continued. \"They descended from the heavens and rained bolts of  led and fire vessels that can match our own magic. They've mastered carriages that ride without a horse and flying beasts made of metal. I do not yet know what powers their machines, and that cost us great deal of lives and effort to halt, but they are simpletons and as such cannot comprehend our command of the elements.

He reaches into a tattered old suit and brings out a bottle of Scotch. He takes a long drink, and with it comes the warmth he's desired.\n\n“Only the good stuff,” he says through a grin.\n\nFootsteps echo beneath the overpass but the man does not turn. When he judges the newcomer to be quite close, he says, “Come on, pilgrim. Warm yourself beside my fire.” \n\n“Much appreciated” and the new man moves up to the trash can and into view. Firelight shines on his dark skin and graying beard. He wears a white hooded sweatshirt, stained yellow with grime. Silence falls, broken only by the sound of an occasional car passing above them.\n\nThe redhead, eyes still set upon the flame asks, “And what brings you to this little corner of hell, my friend?”\n\n“Oh, I just go where my feet take me.

For instance,” and he removes the Scotch again from the coat and takes a long pull. “Care for a nip?”\n\nThe black man regards the bottle, briefly noticing the brand and year, and declines.\n\n“Pearls before swine,” laughs the redhead. “You've never tasted anything like this, I can tell you. A goddamned bum turning down single malt scotch. Well now I have seen it all.”\n\nThe old man shrugs and smiles. “It'd just be wasted on me – wouldn't know the difference.

No point in chasing dreams that make you ignore the here and now.”\n\nSlowly, the man in the tattered suit withdraws the bottle and puts it back in his pocket.

{"archived":true,"author":"Mikeonthecoast","body":"Jesus was busy wiping the mus#BADWORDS# stain out of his beard when he stepped off the curb and was suddenly flying through the air. He landed hard, eating #BADWORDS# on the sidewalk, ass up. \n\n\nThe chopped onions of his hotdog were scattered like teeth across the ground.\n\n\n“Sorry, no freebies,” the hot dog vendor said, wiping the sweat off his forehead with the cleaning rag.\n\n\n“Dad, damn it,” thought Jesus. A mus#BADWORDS# stained beard and now no hotdog to make it worthwhile. \n\n\nA calloused hand with a ring for each finger reached down to help. The hand was attached to a muscular forearm. “It’s not every day you scare some hipster half to death on the good ol’ streets of NYC!” The man with the helpful hand said. His ivory white teeth were piano keys against the brown desert-baked face. “Shouldn’t you be off brunching somewhere?”\n\n\nJesus took the man’s hand and hopped up onto his sandaled feet. “All I needed was a half-decent dirty water dog, friend.” He didn’t mention that he’d been eating too much fish, bread and wine lest the stranger be fully convinced of his hipster credentials.\n\n\nThe man didn’t loosen his grip. His gaze held steady into Jesus’ baby-blues. Without looking down, he said: “That’s an awful looking scar you’ve got there, kid.” The man turned Jesus’ hand palm up, exposing a scabbed-over contusion. “You ought to get to a clinic. Could be infected.”\n\n\nJesus smiled. “I’ll be fine,” he said. “Thanks for your concern.”\n\n\nThe man, dropped Jesus’ hand and playfully slugged him in the shoulder. The man was bald, at least what from Jesus could see from under his tired fedora.\n\n\n“Hey, sorry about the dog there,” the man said. “Let me get you another.” Before Jesus could answer, the man was exchanging a bill for a blank sausage and bun.\n\n\n“Here you go,” the man said. He handed it over. “Do it up the way you like it.”\n\n\nJesus inspected the dry bun and dog. “Er, this is pork.”\n\n\nHalf a dog was already stuffed into the cheek of the man’s mouth. “So?” the man said, mid-bite. He forced the bolus down his throat then a spark flew in his eyes. “#BADWORDS#, dude. Sorry about that. You must be Jewish. Gimmie that.” The man grabbed the dog,and exchanged another bill for a beef sausage. He proceeded to prepare and consume Jesus’ mistake dog.\n\n\nJesus s#BADWORDS#ed on the chopped onions. “Fan of the hot sauce, eh?”\n\n\n“Oh, hell, yeah,” the man said. “Everything is just so...boring...without a little burning, you know what I mean?”\n\n\nJesus didn’t know what the man meant, but he laughed anyway.\n\n\nThe man held up a hot sauce stained finger. “You know...you remind me of someone,” he said. “Ever get that feeling?”\n\n\nJesus looked into the man’s marble black eyes. He did look familiar. Deep desert tans weren’t that common in New York. Besides, Jesus had spent more time in alone in the desert than Al Qaeda hiding from Navy SEALs.\n\n\n“You’re not from around here, are you?” Jesus asked. He put the long-handled onion s#BADWORDS# back in the condiment bin. He chucked the hotdog in the trash. The hot dog vendor shrugged, giving up.\n\n\nThe man grinned. “I was wondering how long it would take you to recognize me.”\n\n\nJesus wiped his fingers with a napkin. The two men took a step toward each other. Then Jesus said, “Hey, ever seen a Broadway show?”\n\n\nThe man cracked a can of Coke and took a few long, slow glugs, not taking his eyes off Jesus. He crushed the can, belched and three-pointed it into the trash. “You know what?” he said, smacking his lips, “That sounds like a hell of a good idea.”\n\n\n“I hear the Book of Mormon is hilarious,” Jesus said.\n\n\n“I can get us in a side door,” the man said.\n\n\nThe hot dog vendor was wiping down his cart, shaking his head as his two odd customers walked off. Then, something caught his eye on the ground, right next to the trash can. He picked them up to take a closer look. They were two feathers: one white and one black.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406693361","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjbpnmk","link_id":"t3_2c1i1a","name":"t1_cjbpnmk","parent_id":"t3_2c1i1a","retrieved_on":1434968636,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Most of the window panes were missing, broken and dispersed across the floor of this abandoned warehouse. I looked out of the window; grass and weeds were reclaiming the cracked parking lot. A light breeze entered the building and suddenly I felt a presence in the empty warehouse with me.\n\nTurning around I saw a figure entering the room, silhouetted by the sunlight streaming in through the doorway. The figure approached me. He was huge, and walked with purpose. I suddenly became very nervous. \"Where's da stuff?\" he barked at me. \"Umm, its in the other room.\" I could barely speak I was so scared. I hated these drop offs. He always sent big scary goons to pick up from me. We walked into the next room. The man walked to one of the crates and opened it. \"This ain't right.\" he sounded very irritated. \"What do you mean?\" Now I was really scared, \"He told me he wanted mozzarella.\" #BADWORDS#, this is bad, real bad. I started to panic, these guys are no joke. I was visibly shaking now. \"No, He said provolone. You stupid or something?\" I was about the reply when another man entered the room with us. He stood in the doorway; there was no escape. \"He said we're done with you.\" The second man said. Oh my god! what am I going to do? \"Ok,\" i stammered, \"Ill take this stuff back and get you the right stuff. Tell him I'll pay for the mix up.\" Ok this should work. \"Yeah you'll pay.\" The first guy laughed and nodded at the second man. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the second man pull something out of his jacket. Then everything went black. \n\nI opened my eyes. The room was starting to get dark. How long have I been here?

It was night and I didn't know where I was but I knew what I had to do. “Now!” screamed an unfamiliar voice, “Cliff now!” it screamed again. I immediately slammed the red button as hard as I could and as quickly as I had pressed the button I  heard a load explosion followed by skidding tires and finally a monstrous cracking sound. There was a moment of silence, but this moment was quickly interrupted by the unfamiliar voice yelling “go go go!” I looked around me and noticed that three other people clandestinely slipped out of the shadows of the buildings and started running to where the noise came from. I slid a comedy mask onto my face and grabbed an empty duffel bag that was right next to me and ran after the three strangers. We rounded the corner of a rectangular building to see an armored brinks truck on its side and split in half. We ran to the truck, I looked into the drivers seat and saw the driver of the truck siting in his seat dead. I froze, staring into the now life less face of a man that I killed. The voice screamed “Cliff, stop wasting time we have to go!” I left the dead man and ran to the open back end of the truck. There was three more guards, all three alive but unconscious I opened the empty duffel bag and started filling it with cash. The truck was littered with stacks of hundred dollar bills. I loaded stack after stack until my bag couldn't fit anymore. We picked up every last stack of money and started running franticly back to where we had started this operation. When we got back we ran around the corner from where were and into an alley. In the alley there was an old white van that we all piled into. We placed our duffel bags in the back and ourselves in the seats. The strange man that was yelling orders got behind the wheel and started driving us away from the city, away from the truck, and away from the man I killed. I woke up with a startle my alarm was echoing throughout the empty house I looked at the clock, it read 8:30. “#BADWORDS# I'm going to be late!” I threw on my shirt jumped into my pants and quickly ran out the door untied tie dangling from my neck. I was in such a rush I didn't notice the strange duffel bag near the front door. I got into my car and drove swiftly to Downtown LA where I worked. I arrived already 20 minutes late. I was running into the building (tie still untied) when I felt my iPhone ring in one quick motion I got it out of my pocket. I looked down at my screen and saw a text from Martin “bro what did you do?? There are two officers at your desk they said something about your fingerprint and a trigger. Damn bro you didn't pull the brinks heist did you?? LOL” When I walked through the front door I was met by a pistol right in my face and a voice yelling at me to get down. The cops put me in handcuffs and brought me to this dark room with one light, one table, one chair and no one but me. The door swung open and a tall man carrying a ziploc bag, and another chair walked into the room. He placed the chair on the other side of the table and sat down. He opened up the bag and handed me the object that was inside it. “Do you remember this?” he asked, I looked down and saw a strange tube in my hand, with a red button on top and a wire leading to somewhere unknown. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406746139","downs":0,"edited":"1406746658","gilded":0,"id":"cjc8rfy","link_id":"t3_2c22x5","name":"t1_cjc8rfy","parent_id":"t3_2c22x5","retrieved_on":1434978002,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"CrashWho","author_flair_text":"/r/CrashWhoWritings","body":"I stared at the bottle and then at the people surrounding it. We had decided, us Super Villains and Superheroes, to host a party together. The whole point was that we might negotiate some kind of peace, but no one seemed interested in that. Instead, they decided to break out some party games, one of which we are playing now: Spin the Bottle.\n\nAs I observe the heroes around me, I try to decide which one I’d like to kiss. My power is being super smart. Well, technically that’s not true. I’m actually a super nerd. If it’s nerdy, I’m the best there is at it, but it also includes super human intelligence. Thus, I can see each possible way to spin the bottle, with just enough force, to land on whichever person I want.\n\nHowever, due to my abilities, I also know everything there is to know about everyone in this room. I’d rather not know some things, but that’s just how it is. So, I can cross off a few already, but there are still a couple I’m intrigued by.\n\n“Nerd Boy totally wants the bottle to land on Mirror Girl,” Bookworm shouted. Unlike me, she was a superhero who’s main power was reading minds, which I always found rather odd as you’d think it was books she read because of her name. Mirror Girl was of course an obvious choice. Her main power was attraction, able to make nearly any person putty in her hands. She didn’t really seem able to pick a side though, occasionally teaming up with the heroes, and rarely with us villains. \n\n“$50 that he spins Muscle Man,” Lucky Man said. His power was being lucky, of course. Now when I looked at the bottle, no matter what I did, it always wanted to land on Muscle Man.\n\nKnowing that my only option was Muscle Man, I hesitated to spin. And then a cold rush of air shot through my lungs and the solution presented itself. All of a sudden, there was only one person the bottle would land on. And my hand reached out involuntarily to spin the bottle.\n\nLucky Man moaned as he paid $50 to Bookworm. The bottle had landed on someone I never expected. I had already realized what was going on before I spun the bottle anyways. The same cold chill ran throughout my body as I involuntarily moved across the circle and planted my lips on The Intellectual’s lips. I proceeded to make out with her for the next minute, no ability to stop myself, even when the others told us to get a room.\n\nAnd then warmth reentered my body. Before I knew it, everyone besides The Intellectual and I were leaving. I guess she decided to heed their advice. And it was now that I realized why she had created this party. My abilities come with a kind of handicap when it comes to women, you might say.\n\n“So, you staying?” she asked.\n\nI looked around at the empty room. Before me stood the greatest superhero of all time. She could control anyone she wanted to, even multiple people at one time. Normally I am the only one who can fight her, what with having developed some material that stops her abilities from affecting me and all. But tonight was supposed to be neutral, so I didn’t bring it.\n\n“Was this all because you liked me or something?” I gulped. “I mean, do you think this is a good…”\n\nThe cold chill fell over me again and I found myself slowly walking towards her.\n\n“Yes,” she whispered in my ear. “How else could we have ever met? I’ve liked you for a long time. You know my secret iden#BADWORDS#y, don’t you? Well, I know yours too. And I know about your abilities. So I knew I would have to be the one to make a move.”\n\nAs we started to kiss again, I started to enjoy the cold sensation running through me. Part of being a Super Nerd was always messing up when it came to women. But with her controlling me, my super powers can’t mess it up. \n\n-209","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406771303","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjclwcq","link_id":"t3_2c70zx","name":"t1_cjclwcq","parent_id":"t3_2c70zx","retrieved_on":1434984369,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"highorderdetonation","body":"Twelve looked up at the sound of thunder.\n\nTwelve was one of the oldest of their kind.  His name, such as it was, was taken from a hunt on a very distant world that had gone awry--the native species had managed to disable his ship, and he had been marooned there for twelve solar cycles.  In so being, he had managed to hunt an unprecedented number of natives before a ship on a separate hunt came to that planet and he was able to return to their homeworld.  Twelve was considered one of his kind's most successful hunters, and so was eventually given control of a world that they used as a proving ground for their younger hunters and occasionally for special hunts of species that had proven unusually...challenging.\n\nIn all his time, Twelve had come across two such species.  One was the quadrupedal natives of the planet he had been marooned on, who apparently called themselves the Katrani.  The other, more challenging species--perhaps the most uniquely challenging he had come across--was native to a planet towards the galactic outer rim that he had visited several times.  The last time he had been there, he had witnessed one of his kind killed in open combat with one of the natives; impressed with the valor of the native, he had given him a trophy he had possessed--a primitive weapon from an earlier hunt on that world.  Later, he had led a mission to capture several of that world's natives for their proving ground so their other hunters could understand how they thought, how they fought.  That hunt had gone well, if not as long as he would have expected.\n\nAnd that indirectly had led to Twelve sending hunters back to that world one cycle ago, in order to obtain a new group of natives.  The report from the surviving hunters was incomplete and fragmented, but apparently some of the natives had put up even stronger resistance than the hunters had been expecting; out of the eight hunters who went, only three came back.  But they had brought back one native...who had disappeared.\n\nTwelve had heard the stories that the younger, and later even the more experienced, hunters told.  The hunters that pursued the native often simply...disappeared into the forests of the proving ground, and weren't heard from.  Some survived, badly or mortally injured, and told of a creature more beast than native, who their weapons apparently couldn't stop--only delay--and who possessed unique weapons of his own that they could not break.  *Hunter of Hunters*, they called it.  And over that cycle a truly unprecedented number of hunters had indeed fallen to it, one by one.\n\nTwelve had finally been told that, while the thrill of the hunt is the hunt itself and their kind prided itself on that, all hunts must end so new ones could begin.  So now he had sent three entire hunting parties--twenty-four hunters--into the forests at once to find the Hunter of Hunters and recapture it if possible...and kill it if necessary.  And now, one lunar cycle later, he had been awakened from his rest by the sound of thunder.\n\nTwelve rose from his bed-sling and walked to the balcony of the structure, looking out over the lush greenery of the proving grounds.  In the distance, in a waning yellow light, a roiling cloud of white and orange rose from the forest.  Twelve knew immediately what it was--the telltale sign that a hunter had activated their final weapon, for when they had no other way to defeat their prey.  This was unusual to Twelve, since one standard cycle before this he had witnessed exactly this from a different--further--part of the forest.\n\nTwelve considered this.  The Hunter of Hunters was the only native of that world that was currently in the proving grounds; while it was possible, if highly unlikely, that he could have bested multiple hunters in single combat over this past solar cycle from what he understood of the natives of that world none of them could normally withstand a hunter's final weapon.  And it had now been used twice, the second time close enough to where he was that it likely wasn't by chance.  Were there multiple natives on this world, and the original reports had been wrong?  Had the Hunter of Hunters somehow avoided the first usage of the weapon, and it was now dead to the second?\n\nTwelve took a moment to pick up his shoulder armor and attach it to his clothing, then his arm-mounted assistantech.  He then took his battered and ancient spear in one clawed hand, and his helmet in the other.  He had to at least verify, if possible, who or what had been lost to this second detonation.  So he set out down a set of stone steps to the ground level of the structure and out an arched opening into the clearing beyond.  As he exited the building a noise came to him on the wind, likely driven by the force of the weapon detonation; it sounded like the howl of one of the beasts on this world, if not one of the quadrupedal beasts of the native's homeworld.\n\nAnd to Twelve it sounded like it was getting closer.  He waited--he knew the beasts of this world could be driven into frenzy by nearby weapon detonations, and could attack anything.  And while the howling grew closer, Twelve's own natural hearing could pick up what appeared to be footsteps...slow, methodical footsteps, like those of the natives.  It must have been outside weapon range, he reasoned.  Somehow it knew where his structure was, and was coming to it.  So be it.\n\nAs a large area of tall grass rustled in time to the footsteps, Twelve turned slightly.  His hand tensed on his spear, and it automatically extended to its full length; he dropped his helmet, and instead made a small motion with his free hand.  Two jagged blades extended from the gauntlet immediately behind it.  Twelve had survived countless hunts, and countless natives, and the Hunter of Hunters would be no different.\n\nAs the Hunter of Hunters cleared the grass and Twelve finally witnessed him, for the first time he realized he was wrong.\n\nThe native was at least two heads smaller than him, but that was not what gave Twelve pause.  It was that the native appeared to be flesh--not the multi-hued outer epidermis of his type, but the fluid-red meat underneath when that epidermis was removed--and was glowing in places, almost white-hot.  He was slowly, heavily, moving towards Twelve with his eyes locked on him, and in those eyes Twelve could see a mixture of anger and pain.  And it was what was making the howling noise.\n\nTwelve's own eyes narrowed slightly as he noticed two additional things: the glowing parts of the native's flesh were fading, which normally only happened once they had expired from his experience.  And second, and more peculiarly, its outer epidermis appeared to be spreading from its extremities to recover itself; in all his travels to that world, Twelve had never known its natives to possess that ability.  He knew that the native had somehow survived the weapon detonation, which made it unique indeed.\n\nThe native trudged to within a dozen paces of Twelve, and stopped.  It finally stopped howling, then raised something in one hand, which itself was punctuated with... *It possesses weapons within itself,* Twelve thought, seeing what appeared to be versions of the claws on his gauntlet extended from within its arm--and then he looked at what it was holding, a net of sorts created from forest vines and tied so it formed a container.\n\nAnd that container was full of hunters' heads.  Some were intact, some were badly damaged, and some appeared to have been seared and scorched clean to the bone by flames.  Twelve took a moment to count them--he could distinguish at least eighteen heads in the net, which appeared to indicate that it had encountered all three hunting parties he had dispatched.  And it had defeated most of them...if not all of them.\n\nThe native dropped the net to the ground.  Its epidermis slowly continued to cover it, and he became more obviously recognizable as a native of that world--the dusky tone of the epidermis, the rough patches of hair centralized to its head and between its legs.  It made no move, but just stared at him; as its epidermis finally reached its face, Twelve realized that it was waiting for him to make the first move.  Patiently.\n\nTwelve knew some words from his travels to that world, though forcing them out through his mandibles was a challenge.  \"What,\" he began in a growl, \"do you want?\"\n\nThe native pointed with the arm that didn't have claws extended from it.  Up, into the night sky.  \"Home,\" it rasped.  \"Home.\"\n\nFor a moment Twelve considered using his shoulder-weapons on the native, but dismissed it.  If it had survived a final weapon...and had defeated three parties of hunters before that...he could fight it, but for the first time that he could recall in his entire existence Twelve did not think he could defeat the native.  It, more than any other prey he had seen, had proven itself truly worthy--and this would definitely bear more analysis later, if not possibly significant hunting parties being brought to its homeworld.  It could be a challenge unparalleled in their history.\n\nBut for now...Hunter of Hunters, indeed.\n\n\"Home,\" Twelve said.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406826803","downs":0,"edited":"1406850731","gilded":0,"id":"cjd5i6w","link_id":"t3_2c8ksp","name":"t1_cjd5i6w","parent_id":"t3_2c8ksp","retrieved_on":1434993858,"score":339,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":339}

{"archived":true,"author":"Last_American_hero","body":"\nAerius looked ahead, and saw he had another 150 meters before what appeared to be a sudden drop. He perched his foot on a rock to stabilize himself as he reached in his pocket to pull out a piece of paper rolled up into a dirty rubber band. Warm smoke from his cigarette drifted up into the air, filling the cavern with the scent of Marlboro ultra light red Tobacco #2. His boots were wet, soaked through, though Aerius  no longer felt the chill gripping his feet. Now, he only felt excited, confusion…and a small but growing tinge of fear.\n\n \n\n*Im definitely past the 1700 meter mark…where the #BADWORDS# am I?*\n\n \n\nAccording to the map, this particular cavern was only about 1700 meters long, and about 50 meters under the ground.\n\n \n\n*I’ve gone twice that distance! And about four times as deep! Aerius thought.*\n\n \n\nAerius realized that in all likelihood, he was the first to have ever gone so far in this cave. In fact, he was likely the first person ever to be in the cave at all. Afterall, it had only been discovered last week.\n\n \n\nThe U.S National office of geospace intelligence had teamed up with geologists to create the first all-inclusive global infrared mapping off the earth’s cavernous systems. Using infrared sateliette imagery, every cave and spacious underground region in the world could now be mapped and measured. The project was originally a means to discover underground military bases and terrorist cells, but U.S special forces was also making use of it for training purpose, and for a bit of off-day excitement.\n\n \n\nCIA SAD operative Aerius Black was now one such beneficiary of modern day technology.\n\n \n\nProject GIST- for Global imaging of Subterrain Topology- was still in it’s infancy, and so mistakes were be expected. Projects were usually refined and updated after the first few months of it’s initiation as mistakes and glitches were uncovered.\n\n \n\n*Of course it has to glitch out in the cave I go through,* Aeruis thought.\n\n \n\nAeruis continued to hike through the rough floor of the cavern. The ground was very uneven, and he constantly had to shift his gear and he climbed and jumped and bear-crawled his way through.\n\n \n\n*I should have refilled my bottle at that stream earlier. I never thought I’d..*\n\n \n\nSuddenly Aeruis stopped. Up ahead, coming from appeared to be below the ledge of the drop…was a shining light. And not just a dim ebb from a flashlight, but a bright, golden glow, almost as if a …city was there, right below the ledge.\n\n \n\nWhat the #BADWORDS#….is THAT?!?!?\n\n \n\n*It’s not possible,* Aeruis thought… *I’m the first human in the world to have ever been in this cave!*\n\n \n\nThen he started to hear it. The sound. A low, high pitched but unmistakable blinking sound, like something from a starwars ship. The sound started to get louder, and louder, and louder….\n\n \n\nAnd suddenly aeruis heard a huge roar, and  MASSIVE light started to come from below the ledge. Aeruis watched, stunned, as a huge metal orb rose from under the ledge into his field of vision. The orb was huge, maybe 50 feet ion diameter, and covered in red flashing lights.\n\n \n\nBefore Aeruis could think, he was suddenly hit in the chest by what appeared to be a thick cloth, and then suddenly started drifted towards the giant orb. He was being carried to the Orb, and as he passed by, he looked down and saw something he couldn’t believe…it was a city. A huge, bright spiraling city, over 1000 feet below him. He was sudden in a massive chamber, thousands of feet wide and thousands of feet deep. He could see the round spherical walls of the chamber miles away from where he was, and before he could process any of this, a hatch opened and Aeruis was carried into the ship.\n\n \n\nHe found himself in a room unlike any room he had ever seen. The room was bright, but with an odd dark red glow. It was filled with machines that Aeruis has never seen before, like something out of a scifi movie. Aeruis noticed that the roof was a solid black color, and appeared to waving and bobbing, as if made out of some kind of Jelly.\n\n \n\n“Hello, Aeruis.”\n\n \n\nAeruis snapped his head down to see a tall figure standing before him. The figure was about 6’3, dressed in strange looking clothes he had never seen before. On his wrist was a metal band with little buttons and lights, and on his feet were strange boots, also with blinking lights. He was about 22 years old, and in excellent shape.\n\n \n\n“I see you’ve found our hidden kingdom.”\n\n \n\n“I…what?”\n\n \n\nThe figure gave a half smile.\n\n \n\n“Our home. It appears that you’ve found it.”\n\n \n\nCia agents were trained to think quickly, and never get fazed, no matter what they came across. Aeruis still wasn’t sure if he was going insane, or if he had banged his head and was in a coma somewhere, but his training kicked in and brought himself together.\n\n \n\n“What is this place? Who are you? And how do you know my name?”\n\n“This is the hidden kingdom of Valaco. I am Mortago of the high council, sent out to meet you. We’ve been watching your trek over the last few hours. We would had sent to get you sooner but we weren’t sure you’d come this far.”\n\n \n\n“Tracking me? Tracking me how? And what IS this kingdom? Where did it come from?”\n\n\n \n\n“ Please, there is much that needs to be explained. I’m quite happy you’re here. Many of are eager to meet you.”\n\n \n\n“Many of US? People have been waiting for me?”\n\n \n\n“O yes, Aeruis, we’’ve been watching and we’re quite excited.”\n\n \n\nAt that, a door suddenly opened in the side of the ship. Aeruis realized they must have been descending and how now reached the bottom.\n\n \n\n“Please”, Mortago said with a beckoning wave of his hand, “come this way”\n\n \n\nAeruis stepped out of the orb, and marveled at what he saw\n\n \n\nA massive city, bigger than anything he had ever seen. It was like downtown toyko or manhattan, but bigger, brighter, with more lights. The buildings had a very futuristic appearance, like something you’d see in a science fiction movie. Flying objects were traveling around, and waves of light filled the air.\n\n \n\nAeruis then noticed clapping and gasping and cheering, and realized that there was a large crowd around the ship.\n\n \n\n“Wave! You are the first non valaconen they’ve ever seen!”\n\n \n\nAeruis, still stunned, managed a wave. Suddenly, a much smaller orb appeared in front of them, and a hacth opened up.\n\n \n\n“Come inside!”\n\n \n\nAeruis sat down next to Mortago, and the craft took off and starting flying over the city. Aeruis watched out of the window, still amazed and unsure what to say.\n\n \n\n“I imagine you have many questions, Aeruis. I’ll answer them all, but before you do, I’ll give you a brief summary of the history of valaco.\n\n \n\nThousands of years of ago, human civilizations were visited by extraterrestrial beings- aliens, you might say- and they bestowed upon us great gifts and knowledge. Humans suddenly knew of the sciences and arts, and were able to build things they had never been built before. These beings were worshipped as gods, until one day, ANOTHER species arrived from the stars to attack both humans, and our own alien-gods. These invaders were not interest in us, but of our visitors, and destroyed all traces of them and their technology. They were at war, you see, and our visitors were hoping to establish earth as a base. Our people were able to escape into this cave, were we built this city with the sacred knowledge of the stars. For thousands of years, we’ve stayed hidden in fear that the invaders will return. But now, through a story that’s quite long and perhaps appropriate for a better time, we’ve learned that the invaders have been destroyed, and we no longer have to fear…..im sorry if that’s a little rushed, im just trying to get you the basics.”\n\n \n\nAeruis’s head was spinning. He looked at mortago:\n\n \n\n“I…this is incredible. We’ve always had evidence and signs of something the ancients has we couldn’t explain…recovered artifacts we didn’t know where they came from”\n\n \n\nAeruis mind jumped to a secret installation 500 meters underground in Alaska, where the government had it’s possession certain…machines, with properties that scientists couldn’t explain.\n\n \n\n“Yes, Aeruis, Olosis bass on the brooks range does indeed contain alien craft and tools.”\n\n \n\nAeruis was, again, stunned…”how do you know of olosis base??/ it’s the most tightly kept secret the us govern…”\n\n \n\n“Please”, mortago waved off with a laugh, “there is nothing we do not know. Our technology far exceeds yours.”\n\n \n\nAeruis slumped into his seat, looking out of the window.. He could see people walking around, some hovering by the metal boots they had on, and other orbs whizzing by. He looked at mortago\n\n \n\n“everybody looks so young…I don’t see anyone old. Or even my age!”\n\nMortago laughed. “most of us are much older than you! I myself am 895. No, we’ve mastered biorenegation technologies. Everybody has the body and mind of one in their early 20s, and we do not age.”\n\n*895?!?!?*\n\n“Aeruis, I don’t mean to rush into things, and we wont- over the next few days, we will show you our city, and teach you our history. We will answer any and all questions you have…but after that, there is much we have to discuss. You may find that you have a special purpose here…and a very special role.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\nThe orb started to descend down towards what looked like a massive temple, well over a mile long.\n\n“Now that it is safe for us to come out in the open, we want to reveal ourselves to the world. We want to share these gifts with humanity, and build a new society.”\n\nThe hatched opened, and they began to step out.\n\n“But how can I help you with that? What role can I have? I don’t know anything about this place! What can I do?”\n\nMortago smiled. “that, aeruis, is what we are here to discuss.”","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406858242","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjdlfxg","link_id":"t3_2cacd1","name":"t1_cjdlfxg","parent_id":"t3_2cacd1","retrieved_on":1435008993,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

But before he could go deeper into the story, an ominous sound emanated from the opposite side of his front door. Three slow, strong knocks. John suddenly became scared, from head to toe. From the headline on the paper to the sudden knocks, John for some reason became a little shocked. Hesitantly, he got up, walked over to the front door, and opened it, squeaking out a meek hello. It was a short fellow, with thinning long hair and a grubby beard. He handed John a piece of paper, stating, \"Eviction for John Raine, Deadline June 6th\".

{"archived":true,"author":"frogandbanjo","body":"He was an immaculately tailored three-piece suit, perfect hair, perfect teeth. He was a firm handshake and direct eye contact.\n\nHe was also a stately office, complete with a glass case full of awards and a row of framed photographs; leaders and magnates and celebrities smiled and posed for the camera. The pictures told a story without sequence or subtlety: perfect hair, perfect teeth, and a firm handshake were the focal point of each snapshot. Every #BADWORDS#an and siren were spokes; he was the hub. *They* were meeting *him,* and each one seemed appropriately thrilled.\n\nThe candidate's head was turned a full ninety degrees. His eyes were fixed upon the images. Meanwhile, across the broad slab of mahogany, the perfect smile was comfortably wide. He'd seen it before, even from several of his colleagues, though rarely was it so obvious. \n\n\"So who are they supposed to be?\" The candidate's head turned sharply back towards the sleek suggestion of a man across the table.\n\nThe perfect smile vanished. The suit shifted. An eyebrow raised. Dark eyes scanned the candidate's face for a telltale flinch or su#BADWORDS#ious strain, but found none.\n\n\"Really? You don't recognize *any* of them? I mean, sure, not everybody keeps up to date with OPEC or the IMF, but... not even *her*?\" \n\nThe candidate did him the courtesy of looking again, though only briefly. \"She's pretty dolled up I suppose. A bit *too* dolled up for my tastes, really. What is she, some princess or something?\"\n\n\"'Is she some princess or...' You know what? Not going to go into it right now. As long as you know who *I* am I suppose that's all that matters.\"\n\nThe candidate rolled his eyes. \"Of course I know who you are. What am I, stupid? Just because you like getting your picture taken with a bunch of random dolled-up hoity-toities doesn't make me *stupid.*\"\n\nThe suit crinkled, even moreso than the face. The face had been trained to mask displeasure. The suit hadn't quite learned the trick. Two strong, clean hands instinctively smoothed out the chaotic collection of creases. Between lips far better suited to perfect smiles, the intake and egress of air became su#BADWORDS#iously even.\n\n\"By the way,\" the candidate continued, \"what's this about, anyways?\"\n\nThe su#BADWORDS#iously even breaths halted. Nostrils flared. Dark eyes narrowed, as though squinting would better penetrate the thick, dull blankness of sincerity dumbly staring them down.\n\n\"*Surely* you were informed,\" the ruffled suit icily intoned.\n\nThe candidate folded his arms and slouched just a bit in the oversized chair. \"Wouldn't *that* have been a nice change,\" he grumbled. \"Seems like the only ones taking the trouble to tell you anything are liars and cheats. Can't get a straight answer for nothing around here.\"\n\nThe crinkled suit straightened in his own stately seat, ice cracking, fire barely suppressed. \"I'll have you know, sir, that I *personally* established a strict series of guidelines on intra-office communication to ensure that this type of situation *never* arose again. You'll not find a whiff of apathy or deceit in our mailroom. If you don't know why you're here, then it's your own damn fault, and frankly you're wasting my time.\"\n\nThe candidate didn't flinch or wilt, but neither did he rise to escalate. Arms still folded, he reenacted his put-upon slumping slouch into his seat and continued staring down his piqued interrogator. \n\n\"Hey, I came here even though I had no idea why you wanted to see me, so that means you're wasting my time too, but you don't see me getting all bent out of shape about it. I can only be sure about what I don't know and what I didn't get told. You're over there acting all certain about what *other* people did and what *other* people got told. I'd say you're the one making the leap here, not me. Think about *that.*\"\n\nThe suit held its power-pose for a moment - an aggressive forward lean -  but ultimately relented. There were rules, after all. Procedures. He'd written most of them.\n\n\"I see. Well then, clearly we have nothing more to discuss. Feel free to go about your business. Hopefully you'll make an effort to become better informed in the future.\"\n\nThe candidate unfolded his arms and rolled his eyes, lifting himself up out of the large leather chair. \"Yeah, well, this little meeting sure as hell didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. Have a *nice day.*\"\n\nDark eyes stared daggers into the candidate's back until the thick wooden door slammed behind him.\n\nThe ruffled suit sighed and drew out an intricately-carved ivory letter opener. Slipping it between the sealed manila, he tilted the envelope and slid out the file. No advance knowledge. Those were the rules.\n\nThe file was thin, but even at that, the suit needed only to glance at the first page. He sighed again - a sad, defeated exhalation, anticipating eons of fresh aggravation yet to come - and pushed down on the intercom button.\n\n\"Mary, set something up with the full panel.

Would my body ever have sleep or would we trade so that I would be awake during the day and at night she would take control?\n\n\"Before we do this,\" She paused to lick her lips. \" I just...I just...want you to know, that I love...I love you.\" She gasped to inhale several times. I squeezed her hand one last time.\n\n\"I love you too.\" I said. A tear dribbled down her face. She gasped for air as her heart monitor began to #BADWORDS#e. Doctors and Nursed rushed in to take us to the O.R. \n\n\"Let's go people!\" A scrubbed up surgeon shouted. \" We have no time to delay!\n\n\"Doctor!\" I called. The surgeon crossed the room to my bed. \"Doctor, is she gone?\" The Surgeon almost removed his mask before realizing the necessity to keep it on. He closed his eyes and nodded.\n\n\"Yes, right now she's gone, so we have to hurry. Soon, she'll be back and you and her will be together for years to come.\" He turned to the rest of his staff. \"LET'S GO PEOPLE!\" He snapped.\n\nI ripped the I.V. out of my arm. \n\"#BADWORDS# That!\"\n\nThe Doctor turned to me, rightfully confused.\n\n\"I don't even like a woman living in my house, there's no way I'm living with one in my head.!\"\n\nThe surgical staff stood still as I got out of bed.\n\n\"But Sir!\" The surgeon pro#BADWORDS#d. \"We can save her!\"\n\nI looked at him, but I didn't even have to think about it. I'd been thinking about this since the mind meld operation was first addressed as a possibility. I shook my head.\n\n\"No thanks Doc, I'm walking out of here alone.\"\n\nThe surgeon continued to stare at me. Even with the mask on I could see his mouth was gaping beneath the mask.\n\n\"But why? We've been setting up this surgery for two years... She's your wife!\" I nodded at him. but sighed.\n\n\"Yeah, and since the beginning, this has been the plan. I loved my wife. I wanted her to know she was going to a better place when her body failed her, but that better place sure as hell isn't my head!\" I strolled out of the prep area. My hospital gown flapped behind my as the entire hospital staff was treated to a view of my retreating ass. The surgeon tried to speak but words failed him. He pulled his mask off and sat down. My wife would soon be buried, I had planned her an elaborate and respectful funeral. I dressed and exited the hospital. I knew that many people would judge me, some would call me a monster, but having another person in my skull would be far more monstrous.I exited the hospital. The cold night air would forever to be a reminder of what I did. I appreciated it, because once I died, I doubted I'd ever see a cold night in hell.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1406973032","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjes5z3","link_id":"t3_2cbtc1","name":"t1_cjes5z3","parent_id":"t3_2cbtc1","retrieved_on":1435029836,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"clockworkoctopus","body":"My mother's first tattoo showed up when she was 13 - an \"early bloomer\" she always said. Hers was simple. It appeared over the span of 2 hours, black ink, six numbers: 10/21/19. The day she met my father. Her second tattoo was much like the first, and this one marked the day of my birth: 08/03/24. Her final tattoo took a full 18 hours, but when it was done, its meaning was a lot less evident - a shattered lightbulb on the inside of her left bicep appeared on the day I turned 18. \n\nMy first tattoo took 3 weeks. I first began to feel the itch one week before my high school graduation. It woke me up sometime before dawn and it's kept me from getting any real shut-eye ever since. It's been a little over a month now. \nEtched into my left hand, it began at my wrist and sprawled out to my finger tips- a tree with five branches. The contours and knots in the bark so deeply defined it drew blood. I thanked god I was right-handed. \n\nFor 21 days it grew across my hand becoming more and more detailed. When the pain finally subsided, and the skin healed, I had the barren skeleton of an oak tree permanently inked into my hand. I didn't know what to make of it, nor did anyone I asked. \n\nJust about everyone I know has seen it by now, and everyone has their own ideas as to what it could mean for me. I was content in my ignorance. I had enjoyed my life as an \"unmarked\" so far, and I was disquieted by the idea of something out of my control dictating my life. I was content, until I met her. \nHer real name is #BADWORDS#ya, and she has been covered in ink since she was 16. Her first tattoo, a sphinx, appeared on her right thigh at the age of five. \n\nWhere my mother's tattoos were simple and straightforward, #BADWORDS#ya's were open-ended and extensive. She was given the pet name Temnota, or Tem for short, from her babushka. I think it translates to something like \"darkness\" or maybe an absence of light? Some grandmother. \n\nI met Tem as my skin was beginning to heal. She recognized the fresh ink while we were both in line at the pharmacist's counter. I was picking up my mother's new cancer #BADWORDS#tail, and who knows what mix of medications Tem was there for. Her bag was hefty. \n\nShe eyed my palm, then stared at my face for longer than I would have liked. Wordlessly, she scanned my body for other discernible signs of ink, but when he found none, her eyes snapped back up to mine. Her left eye was a cold, pale blue, while her right began as the same blue before shifting to a sort of greenish brown? My mom calls it hazel but I wouldn't know the first thing about that kind of #BADWORDS#. \n\nWe must have stared at each other for a full minute before she blinked, turned on her heel, and strode out the door. \nMy left thumb prickled as a small bud began to take shape. \nI followed her out the door.\n\n\nI'm sitting on a stiff, white leather couch in an overly-lit living room with a pitbull drooling on my boot. Tem said she'd be \nback in 5. It's been 45. \n\nDesperation that was once curiosity was the only thing that kept me glued to my seat. Tem might be the first person to be able to offer a valuable interpretation. \n\nOr she might just be #BADWORDS# with me. \n\nI hear her footsteps coming down the stairs, so I shift forward on the couch. The pitbull is unfazed. \nShe tosses me a photo album and tells me to turn to the page she marked. \n\nFlipping through, I realize that she has catalogued each of her tattoos- photos, dates, time frames... all the pertinent information for each tattoo, organized in chronological order. \n\nShe bookmarked tattoo 21. I stare at the page. \n\nOn her right side, from hip to armpit, is the tree. My tree. Only instead, hers is flowering, and where I have my new bud, she has a fresh pink scar. \n\n\"It disappeared the second I left the pharmacy\" she said, \"that's never happened before.\" \n\n\nEDIT: formatting ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1407120305","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjg7lq3","link_id":"t3_2cggep","name":"t1_cjg7lq3","parent_id":"t3_2cggep","retrieved_on":1435055090,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"MATlad","body":"\"Work was... brutalizing.\"  And it was: one of his concerns was a plant, completely automated.  Raw materials in, boxes out; machines making other machines.  UAVs for the military, Vacoombas, and per his queue insertion, battle drones.  Ones which he'd stockpiled, armed, and today, unleashed upon Starfish Oil's refinery operations.  Unlike Wendy, Starfish *was* responsible, and he'd start the Dismantling with them.  He'd botnetted an avalanche of e-mail to Starfish, their employees, and their employees' families: \"The Dismantling begins with Hope Bay Refinery at noon.  Get out.\"\n\nEverything had gone according to plan: the bipedal drones rose out of the bay, like vengeful leviathans out of the deep, the aerial drones hugging the Earth, like jet-powered dragonflies.  The drones fired into the land and water surrounding the refinery, warnings for those who'd refuse to heed his warning.  The attack would proceed from the periphery inwards, giving the workers a chance to flee.  The attack would finish with a bang--he'd counted on the explosion of the storage tanks wiping out the remaining drones, and covering his tracks.\n\nBut then that #BADWORDS# had shown up.  The Amazonian.  How she fought in her skimpy red and blue costume, high-heeled boots, and domino mask was beyond him.  He had become an accomplished roboticist (at least, he thought himself one--he didn't dare share his accomplishments with the world) and didn't think she was a robot.  She had incredible strength, the ability to fly, could take damage that rightfully should've vapourized or at least pulverized her.  She was obviously getting hurt: bleeding, even limping once or twice in her various battles.  And how the Hell did her costume stay more-or-less intact?!  But always, she prevailed.\n\nHis drones had mostly destroyed large parts of the plants, warehouses, and the now-empty offices, but the Amazonian had shown up before the drones could breach the holding tanks.  They were depressingly ineffective against her.  He'd have to fix that: maybe something more experimental in the next batch, though that would increase the risk it might be traced back to him.  He was patient.  The last telemetry he'd received had included a still of the Amazonian flying towards the final drone, black hair, soot-stained face and costume, and penetrating green eyes.\n\n\"Anyways, that's all boring.  I got a new toy to try out: neural-interfaced exosuit!  Well, the legs at least--if it helps me, maybe it can help other vets.  Wanna help me in?  You passed the crate on your way in.\"  They brought it in out of the hallway, the crate opened up easily enough, and the exolegs were exposed.\n\nThey were sleek, and angular, a dark gunmetal.  To Wendy, they looked superficially like the styling on the robots that she'd seen continually replayed on the news.  And that she'd seen first-hand when she'd fought them as the Amazonian.\n\nShe hadn't come up with the name, and felt it overly dramatic and definitive-article-y, but someone had started calling her that and the name had stuck--it was better than to be known as Wendy, or Eleanor Wendell Kennedy.  So The Amazonian she'd be.\n\nShe was a single child.  Well, probably.  She looked like her parents, and knew they loved her as their own, and unconditionally.  But when her powers started manifesting, and it was almost certainly not the normal course of feminine #BADWORDS#rty, they'd told her.  They'd found her behind glass in a strange cradle in the woods near their cabin.  They'd thought she was dead.  Her mother had reached out to touch the cradle, and been blown backwards for her trouble.  And then, they heard the baby's cries, as if she'd been rudely and suddenly awoken.  But they knew nothing else, and the cradle (and glossy metal plate they'd also found) had thus far yielded no further secrets.\n\nAs a teen, her parents had accepted her nascent powers, and were proud that they had not spoiled her, nor shielded her from the world.  That she'd had a good sense of self, and right and wrong.  But they also warned her that living up to her potential could be dangerous, could be *lonely*.  Looking back, it seemed ridiculous that a wig, (not wearing) contacts, a wispy mask, and moving fast enough to avoid good surveillance pictures would allow her to remain separate from her alter-ego, but it had, and had worked through high school, college, law school, and even into her professional life.  \n\nShe'd dated a little when she was younger, but realized what her parents had meant when they'd warned her about the loneliness.  Then she'd met Roger while volunteering at the animal shelter her trust-fund partially supported.  He was quiet: the staff knew he'd been in the war, and that he was of means, but he never talked about himself, and they reasoned that he was helping the shelter and animals as much as the shelter and animals were helping him.  She'd fallen for the broken puppy, and let herself go.  Was it so wrong to ask for a little for herself, just this once?  She'd have to eventually figure out how to handle that...\n\nHe noticed her startled reaction, \"Wendy?\"  Then he noticed her distinctly blue eyes were green.  Penetrating.  And remembered the single contact case he'd piled the bobby pin collection beside when he was tidying up a few days ago.\n\nShe looked...  \"Amazonian...?\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1407401620","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjjcrz9","link_id":"t3_2ctvn9","name":"t1_cjjcrz9","parent_id":"t1_cjjcrwp","retrieved_on":1435116312,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"Dog_Bread","body":"Honestly, Greg doesn't seem that bothered. The characteristic eye-roll is the same as always. But this morning it's like he's mocking me. Thanks, mate. A twist of the knife. Then he looks away again and gets on with eating breakfast. Dismissal.\n\t\nI can't face the plate of eggs and bacon and beans and toast. It's cooked and ready out of habit, and the mug of tea is steaming. There's no temptation in the fat and salt. No problem keeping to the diet today. Take a bite of the toast at least. Chewing is a chore, no appe#BADWORDS#e.\n\t\nMushrooms and tomato are con#BADWORDS#uous by their absence. The last of them went into the dinner last night. The farewell dinner, as it turns out. The last meal, by default, because as I swallow that single bite, I know that the rest of this is going in the bin. I pick up the knife to sc#BADWORDS# it like leftovers.\n\t\nNo. Can't even be bothered with that. Put the plate down. I just stand in the kitchen, feeling numb. That's not right, you can't feel numb because numb is the absence of feeling. So I just stand there feeling not much of anything, the pedantic part of the brain the only part left with anything to say.\n\t\nLeft hand comes up, goes back down again. Right hand instead, knocking thumb and forefinger against the side of the plate, feeble. Am I going to fling this plate and make a mess? I look at Greg and ask him. He looks at me, tongue pink, closes his mouth and looks away again.\n\t\nMy breath gets ragged, all abrupt like. Am I #BADWORDS# crying? Yes, there's the tears. One drips into the tea, reminding me that the teabag is still stewing in the water. Another on the counter top. Another hanging on the end of my nose as I grimace, and a small voice in the back of my head wonders if the droplet will fall on the eggs or the bacon. Easy to lean just a fraction of an inch either way to make it decisive. Instead I throw my head back and sniff it in.\n\t\nGreg is having a #BADWORDS# now. I'm not sure why he is still here, and if I am going to get custody. I don't want him. I feel spite now. Feel like breaking something. Plenty of beautiful things in the cupboards. Plenty of things that don't belong to me and won't be here forever. Might as well do it now, while I still have the chance and still have the heart.\n\t\nOpening the drawers, pulling out the fancy #BADWORDS#owels and dropping them on the floor. Yeah, I don't care, I'll stand on them. Don't want to make a lot of mess though. On the other hand, why not?\n\t\nTurn around, open the cupboard and pull out fine china cups. Toss a few of them into the sink, casual, all nonchalant. None of them smash completely, but they chip. Handle breaks off at least one. It occurs to me that the trap in the basin will stop the pieces from getting into the pipes.\n\t\nPick another drawer. Ethnic wooden salad s#BADWORDS#s. One of the first things we bought together. Snap with a bit of effort if I stick them in between the counter and cooker. Not so casual anymore. Half of them drop into the narrow space. It's going to be a hassle to get them out. Someone would have to move the whole cooker.\n\t\nBack into the drawer. Big sharp knife. Professional chef type, with a laser-engraved brand name in the blade. It's too heavy duty for me to damage it, but it would do some nasty work on the pretty candles along the windowsill.\n\t\nEach wick is still virgin white as the blade goes into the wax. Designs on the side of each pillar split while heavy halves tumble. These were just-for-show, really. And now they are ugly and broken, like so many nice things can turn. The weight of the knife is satisfying; the resistance of the wax enough that a little effort is rewarded. Chop chop chop on the remaining pieces. They are shooting off the ledge, clattering about and hitting other things. A chunk of wax gets stuck in the bars of Greg's cage.\n\t\nThe end of the blade pokes in, and I retrieve the chunk like cheese . Greg is still, except for those bulging eyes following the movement of my hand. Flick of the wrist and the wax is in the basin. Will I hurt him? Bouncing the knife in mid air, racket-like, I decide. And as my breath gets ragged again, I think I will end up hurting myself too.\n\t\nKnife laid flat on top of the cage. Opening the little door and picking him up. Daddy's got you Greggy, there a good lad. There is still a bit of #BADWORDS# hanging on as I pull him out. It drops off on to the counter at the same time as another tear drops off my face. I put him down on the chopping board.\n\t\nGripping his back end, I look down. He's not expecting this. He looks like a courgette, green against the wood. It feels like last night, making my famous pasta. Salt water splash on his back. Index finger along the top edge of the blade. My strong right arm, poised to slice.\n\t\nI can't do it.\n\nI'm sorry Greg. Daddy loves you.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1407438530","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjjrobw","link_id":"t3_2cwbe5","name":"t1_cjjrobw","parent_id":"t3_2cwbe5","retrieved_on":1435123577,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"pianobutter","body":"Death loses its sting when you can't even remember how many people you have killed with can openers. The line blurs. In life, you see death. In death, you see life. Sometimes its hard to know whether you're the angel of death or the angel of life. It is tricky business.\n\n\nThe angel had adorned Jacob with a scarlet veil to cover his eyes. Good boy as he was, he sat in anticipation, not flinching.\n\"There must be some other way,\" said Johanna. *Don't you think I've asked myself that very question a thousand times?* the angel thought. But then again, those were only the first thousand of billions.\n\"This is the only way,\" he said. *At least the only way I know ...*\nShe gave a sigh. Wearing the same dress as the first time they met, she was the one looking like an angel. If she'd known there had been a way, what would she have said? That he had had the power to prevent a death? Thank you? Or that he had squandered it? He wasn't quite sure. Happiness was only temporary. So was life. It seemed pointless to strive for something that would be washed away by the shore like that.\n\n\n\"Um, I have an itch,\" Jacob said.\n\"Here, let me--\" Johanna said, but was stopped by the angel.\n\"How's that?\" he said.\n\"Cold ...\" Jacob answered. As if he was the one stung by coldness, the angel jumped back. He looked at Johanna. She looked so stern. Like he was failing her.\n\"Oh, grow up,\" he said to Jacob.\n\"I wish I had the chance, father. Can you at least turn off that damn music?\" Chopin had been playing in the background. Nice background music for death, the angel had figured. Jacob and Johanna disagreed.\n\"I killed him, you know,\" the angel said with a hollow grin. \"He was a beautiful man, and I wanted to do something special for him. I gave him the most beautiful gift I know.\"\n\"And what was that?\" Johanna said.\n\"A unique death. No ever died like him before and no one ever will.\"\nJohanna gave a sarcastic laugh. \"That *is* rather like you. You have no idea what it means to be a human being. I mean, can't you even see death from our perspective? Do you really think anyone would want a unique death?\"\nIt actually had not occurred to him before. He tried to give a response, fumbled with a few fragments and false starts, and then grew quiet. It was all the mustered before blurting out, \"You damn humans. Everything has to be so damn special all the time. You celebrate every step closer to death with wreckless abandon, and the more special this celebration, the better. And when you're finally there, you tell me you don't want it to be unique anymore? Death is the climax. The end of the lifelong build-up. The release of a tension building from birth. No, it is not I who do not understand humans. It is humans who do not understand death. It is to be cherished. To be celebrated.\"\nHe was breathing heavily at this point. Eyes widening, he wiped sweat from his forehead.\n\"So do it already.\"\n\"Jacob, that is not what I meant.\"\n\"No, come on. This is what you have been waiting for, right? Kill me. It's fine. I'm not interested in this sorry affair any longer.\"\nJohanna had her eyes closed. Clenched. Biting her lower lip so hard it could come off. Jacob wore a similar expression. What did they think they were expressing? They probably thought, like the rest, it was fear. But the angel knew better. It was gra#BADWORDS#ude.\n\"I'll make it special,\" he said.\n\"Oh, just get it done,\" Johanna said. \"And do me next.\"\nThe angel took a deep breath in.

{"archived":true,"author":"AT-ST","body":"08AUG4014\n\nYes#BADWORDS#ay Mr. Walters found a small case containing 3 (Three) round disks.  Both the case and the disks are made of primitive plastics.  The disks measure 120mm (On Hundred and Twenty Millimeters) in diameter and 1.2mm (One point Two Millimeters) thick.  In the center of all 3 (Three) disks was an 18mm (Eighteen Millimeter) hole.  One side of each disk contains a picture depicting someone or some setting.  See attachments *A*, *B*, and *C* for copies of the pictures.  The other side contains a mirrored surface, with what appears to be rings engraved in them.  See attachment *D.*\n\nMr. Walters figured that maybe the mirrored side contained engraved information.  We scanned each disk's mirrored side into the computer.  Upon looking at the results we determined that Mr. Walters was correct in his hypothesis.  We appeared to be looking at binary information, with the engravings being nothing more than a string of 1s (Ones) and 0s (Zeros).  We set the computer to decoding the the binary information, and after 3 hours we were granted with the first few glimpses at what was contained on the disks.  We estimate that it will take the computer 23 days to completely decode and clean the information.  Upon completion we will forward copies of the decoded information, along with the disks themselves, back to the ship.\n\nThe glimpses we got appeared to be a Two Dimensional image accompanied by audio.  Luckily the language spoken was a primitive version of, the now dead language, English.  There were also a few instances of some unknown languages, but luckily those are accompanied by sub#BADWORDS#les.  The computer has automatically translated all of the English, with a few exceptions but I believe these exceptions are names of races or people that we are no longer familiar with.\n\nMr. Walters and I believe that the disks contain an account of a large historical event set in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  We are still unclear if the account was a recreation or a do#BADWORDS#entary, though we both are currently leaning towards recreation.  I have created a bullet point list of what we have discovered on the disks so far.\n\n**Creatures** - We see images of several unheard of creatures, and a few creatures that are only spoken of in legends and myths.\n\n* Trolls (Mythological creature)\n* Orcs/Orks (new creature.  Seem to be smaller trolls.  A brutal and aggressive race.)\n* Goblins (Mythological creature, though we think the name was used interchangeably with Orcs/Orks)\n* Wraiths (Mythological creature, though this specific type is not one that can be found in known stories.)\n* Hobbits (New creature.  They appear to be really short humans with slightly pointed ears, and large hairy feet.)\n* Dwarves (Plural) / Dwarf (Singular) (Mythological creature.  Look similar to Humans. They are short, about the same size as a Hobbit, but stockier.  All known Dwarves have a big bushy beard.  The account seems to imply that even the females grow extensive facial hair as well.)\n* Wizards (Though we count them as fictional people with 'Magical' abilities, this accounts seems to imply that they are their own race.  Will have to research once all data is decoded.)\n* Ol-ee-fants (Spelling unsure at this time.  They appear to be a distant relation to today's Elephant.  Though they are much much bigger.  One Ol-ee-fant can carry as many as 40 humans.)\n* Wargs (New Creature.  They appear to be a large 4 (Four) legged carnivorous beast.  They are large enough for the Orcs/Orks to ride.\n* Giant Eagles (New Creature.  They appear to be a large extinct version of the better known extinct Golden Eagle.)\n* Ents (Mythological creature.  Though they go by a previously unheard of name, they are walking talking trees.)\n* Humans (The now extinct humans appear to be the dominant race at the time of this account.)\n* Elves (Plural) / Elf (Singular) (We are Physically depicted similarly to how we are today.  However our ancestors seemed to put up the allusion that we had \"Magical\" abilities.  However, our ancestors were good with bows and arrows.)\n* Gollum (This is a skin and bones, hairless creature.  It appears both his name, and his race's name is Gollum.  Though he does go by Smeagol for awhile.  Will have to investigate further.)\n\nThere are also a lot of unremarkable fish, birds and other wildlife seen and mentioned.  To categorize them all would require extensive research and will be saved for when Mr. Walters and I return to the ship.\n\n**Technologies** - The technological level at the time seems to be much farther behind than previously thought.  Though they had the ability to record and preserve this account.  Many people are seen living in huts and hovels with no heating or aircon.  Food is prepared over an open flame, using wood or dung for fuel.  There seems to be little industry, though one of the Wizards appears to be making a break through in that area.  The wars are fought with Bows, Spears and Swords.  The means of transportation seems to be Horses for Humans, Dwarves (though they don't seem happy about it), Elves and Hobbits.  Wargs for select Orcs/Orks, or just running for hours on end for most of the Orcs/Orks.  There are however a few exceptions were technology seems to surpass even us.\n\n* Invisibility ring - A simple golden ring with an (currently) unknown inscription on it.  The ring gives the wearer the ability to go invisible.  However, the Wraiths appear attracted to it, possibly by a strong EMF field.  The effects of the ring also seem to be addicting, as those who have worn the ring lust after it and seem really protective of it.  The ring was seen being destroyed at the end of the account.\n* Advanced Staffs - Each Wizard appears to have a staff that has extraordinary abilities.  The abilities seen so far have been:  \n\n1.  Enhancing the user's strength.  Enough to send creatures flying upon being struck, and cracking rock.\n2.  Giving the user almost telekinetic powers.  The staff can be used to move objects or creatures without touching them.\n3.  Creates a blinding white light.  It is assumed that this light hurts Orcs/Orks and trolls, though more research should be done on the subject.\n\n* Swords with built in Sensors - Some swords, supposedly made by our ancestors, have a built in sensor package.  These sensors seem to pick up on the presence of Goblins, and Orcs/Orks.  Though the method of notification is primitive, it seems effective.  The swords glow blue in the presence of a Goblin or Orc/Ork.  The closer and larger the group the brighter the sword glows.  These swords also appear to be made of a metal that Goblins and Orcs are allergic too, since they fear even the slightest touch of the weapon.\n* Communication Orbs - The Wizards seem to be in possession of an Orb that has visual and audio communication abilities.  If you have an orb you can communicate with someone else who also possesses one.\n* Glowing water - Our ancestors appeared to have mastered a special water that can glow brightly.  I assume that it is a chemical reaction, but I am not sure.  This technology may not seem advanced, but at the time depicted the only light sources available were fire or the sun.\n\nThat is all I have to report on at the moment.  I will get back to excavating the dig site until the computer has decoded more.  Once I have had a chance to study the data more thoroughly I will submit another report.\n\n**Signed**\n\nTom Bombadil\n\nChief Archaeologist","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1407533091","downs":0,"edited":"1407562913","gilded":0,"id":"cjkw16a","link_id":"t3_2czp6k","name":"t1_cjkw16a","parent_id":"t3_2czp6k","retrieved_on":1435143577,"score":13,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":13}

{"archived":true,"author":"Crypto7899","body":"What?!\n\nI stared the screen in front of me, mouth hanging open in shock. I sat there for a while, until my roommate came into the room to see me staring at the screen of my laptop.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.\n\n\"N-nothing,\" I replied, my voice trembling nervously.\n\nShe seemed as if she was going to say something else, but obviously decided against it. I turned towards her, thinking of how to phrase what I was going to say next.\n\n\"I'm going on a trip for a few days,\" I announced, trying to keep my wobbling voice level.\n\n\"Ooh, exciting,\" she said, \"can I come?\"\n\n\"Umm...no. It's just visiting family. You'd hate it,\" I replied.\n\nShe simply shrugged in protest, and climbed into her bed, falling asleep almost instantly.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next morning, I packed a small bag and called a taxi to take me to the airport. Using what little savings I had, I caught an early morning flight to Williamsburg. As I left the airport, faint images came flickering to the forefront of my mind, memories of places that were a lifetime ago.\n\nI just knew where I had to go. I was only a few streets away now. They looked the same, only...slightly fresher. They had only but built ten years before I moved there with my family anyway.\n\nI mentally recalled the names of the streets as I walked down them. Ridgewood Parkway. Cornwallis Place. Berkeley Place. And finally...\n\nArgall Place.\n\nThis was it. \n\nI took a deep breath and took the first few steps down the familiar tarmac of the road, my legs shaking with every step. \n\nWhat would I do? I was not even sure I could keep going, but my body decided it would.\n\nI counted down the numbers...getting closer with each terrifying pace.\n\nAlex's house, my childhood friend. \n\nHe would be there now. I checked my watch. Probably somewhere in his room at this time, or else eating food.\n\nAnd where would I be?\n\nProbably the same.\n\nThere it was. My house. Now that I had come this far, I was not sure if I could go further. I had reached the end of my journey. I stood there until the sky turned dark and the stars began their watch over the Earth. \n\nA memory came to the surface.\n\nOf course.\n\nI looked at my house, at the porch window.\n\n*FOR RENT*\n\nSlowly, I stepped forwards, measuring each step carefully, and raised my fist. I brought it against the door, making three careful, precise knocks. \n\nSeveral seconds later, the door opened. \n\nThe world seemed to slow as I looked at the face of the young boy in front of me.

These days there is only the long staircase up from the grave and where there used to be the lines for Saints/Martyrs, who go straight in, or used to anyway, and the Hall of Judgement, where practically everyone else had to go, there is now only a hastily-constructed gate, chained closed, with a sign that says 'No Vacancy, detour to Reincarnation', and the line just swerves off to the right before cycling back around towards life again.

She turned in her seat to eye him for a moment... he was tall, yes, but his skinny frame and hunched posture made him look shorter, as did the oversized glasses perched precariously on his nose.\n\n\"You, er... you dropped this...\" The man dove down to scoop up the delicate silk scarf, proffering it like a desperate supplication.

Yes, er, very nice, very unusual,\" he blinked at her through the thick glasses. \"Are you here alone?\"\n\n\"I'm waiting for my, er... fiance. He's on his boat.\" She indicated the stunning bay visible through the huge windows of the bar, trying to pretend she hadn't hesitated.\n\n\"Oh yes? I have a boat,\" he volunteered, then blushed as she looked at him disbelievingly. \"Of course it's a company yacht,\" he continued and she nodded. That made more sense. \"We've been sailing around the fishing grounds, to the south. Maybe I saw him there?\"\n\n\"What? No, he'd never go anywhere near fishing grounds, far too... common .

She smiled and pointed. \"Ah, there he is now. Would you like to meet him? He would be amused to meet another... sailor? Jimmy?\" When she looked back, Jimmy had vanished.\n\n\"Odd little man,\" she said, then stood to give the large man a welcoming kiss. \"You just missed the oddest little man,\" she told him. \"He was like one of those actors you like so much, you know... lolly and Hardy.\"\n\n\"Laurel,\" he corrected her with a deep tenor, frowning. \"What man? There are MI6 agents looking for us, you know.\"\n\nShe snorted with laughter. \"Oh, don't worry. There is no way this man was a secret service agent. He was some trader enjoying his company yacht, that's all. Come, you can buy me another drink.\"\n\nThey turned to the bar, watched from across the room by narrowed eyes.

{"archived":true,"author":"TheRealSkyBeard","body":"With the completion of the black hole generator, physics greatest question could finally be answered. When an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, what happens. With my experiment being broadcast across the known galaxies, underground bets were at entire solar systems. Stuff like that is pointless to me in the face of such magnificent science. But enough about that small talk, you're probably wondering how this all started.\n\nIt all started with the discovery of the Omega point in the Andromeda void. It was theorized way back in the days before quantum travel to have been a solidified black hole. It was an area of nothingness. Strong, weak, electric, and gravitational forces were not existent in this sector. Neither matter nor energy could interact with it. Once humanity could actually travel to the sector through quantum travel, it was discovered to be quantum locked. Basically, this sector of space did not exist in time. And it was growing.\n\nFear immediately struck the entire Andromeda galaxy. Even the most fearless criminal sects fled for the safety of time. Scientists, myself included, were astounded by it's existence and expansion. It had no correlation to the expansion of the universe. It had no steady acceleration or velocity. Most importantly, it didn't seem like it was going to stop. And then it did. The omega point, for whatever reason, ceased it's expansion. But the fear remained, and nobody returned. \n\nSo you're probably wondering why I'm here, with the black hole generator, right outside the omega point. I blew up a solar system in a fit of rage. I killed millions. And for my punishment, I was forced to discover a way to remove the omega point. So why not kill two birds with one stone. The omega point is the unstoppable force. It does not exist, it can not be affect by the universe. A black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape it's grasp.\n\nThe broadcast begins to roll and the weight of the situation hits me like a ton of bricks. I realized that i am most likely going to die, just like the trillions I killed in a fickle rage. With my fingers trembling, I start the black hole. It takes a minute to gather enough energy and mass, and in an instant the black hole forms right outside the omega point. \n\nBANG\n\nAn explosion of energy so strong, my physical being is vaporized in an instant. The universe is ripped apart and started again anew, in which I have found myself to be a godly being without a physical form. Who would have thought that the greatest question would be the answer to the one question we never thought we'd truly find an answer too.

{"archived":true,"author":"Free_#BADWORDS#","body":"She peered out into the ominous void of space, trails of light shining defiantly against the blackness, trails of light that were mere pawns in the endless cycle of destruction.\n\nThe woman was beautiful. Her face picturesque, eyes a radiant blue, blonde hair streaming down her back. Hundreds of others were crowded around her on the observation deck. A miasma of ancient regret descended upon the immense chamber, wordlessly communicating this moment's gravity. The Earth was far below them, a small gray spot that looked somber among fields of glistening stars, becoming ever-smaller as the starships hurdled away. She remembered, long ago, when that tiny ball that spun around the sun wasn't so somber. Before the Final War, as the children had named it—the vicious war that had plunged the planet into ceaseless nuclear winter, the war that had ripped everything from her.\n\nHumanity had retreated underground, erecting vast subterranean cities, interconnected by a web of tunnels that expanded the globe. And, as they cowered miles beneath the surface of the acidic world, they searched the heavens, driven by a fervent desperation for a brighter future. A second chance. It had taken them almost three-hundred years to find it—a habitable planet 54 light years away, orbiting a star just a hair larger than the sun. The journey there would take almost a century: a whole generation would live their entire lives trapped within these metallic monstrosities, the majority of them dying before ever reaching humanity's new home.\n\nThe woman sighed at the thought. She didn't look old. No, she looked barely in her twenties. But she felt old. She *was* old. It was as if every decade she lived put more weight on her shoulders, pulled her deeper into the depths of a hopeless despair that had become her entire existence. The woman looked around her, seeing these sorrowful, yet hopeful, resolute faces. *Fools,* she thought. These children hadn't seen the atrocities she had. The genocides, the wars, the *end of the world*. Even then, however, she had still clung to hope—hope that the generations following would learn from previous mistakes.\n\nBut they didn't. Even then, when faced with the possibility of extinction within the confining walls of earth, the city-states squabbled and fought over who deserved what—more senseless conflict, alighting upon her more shadows of despair.\n\nShe pointedly gazed back out the window, as if demanding answers from the expanse beyond. A fire blazed within, the disappearing world enkindling emotions she'd thought were lost decades ago.\n\n*Why!* she screamed in her head, her own voice resounding in the disciplined emptiness of her mind. *Why did I do this to myself!* She averted from the window and pushed through the crowd, some of them watched her pass in surprise: this was the last chance to see Earth!\n\nThe woman found herself running through the dim corridors of the starship, forcing open hatches, jumping over obstructions, crying out as ceaseless tears overwhelmed her. She couldn't watch! Her world was being left behind. A world only *she* had truly known. These children were used to living in cramped spaces, in metal boxes with hatches for door, and plastic windows that peered out into only darkness. They didn't know true life! They didn't know what it was like to bask in the sun, or feel the rain on your skin, or run through fields of grass. They knew *nothing*!\n\nHer heart became lead, the centuries of despair crushing down upon her, weakening her at the knees, and tugging her to the floor with a clang. She lay there, cheek pressed against the cool, unforgiving metal, tears pooling beneath her.\n\n\"Why?\" She whispered. \"Why did this happen to *me*?\" The woman fell through the floor, into a world of memories faded—memories of the foolish girl she had been so long ago.\n\nIt was supposed to be a gift! A gift from the Father! The thought of dying had terrified her, so she imagined it—willed it away. The thought of old age, she willed it away. Ugliness, sickness, pain. But so many things that once scared her, terrified her, now called to her, taunted her, yet were forever out of her reach. How long was she to live like this? How long would she have to witness the cycle of destruction tearing humanity apart and forcing it back together? *I can't go on . . .*\n\nA single flame of hope flickered to life in her mind. But she had promised herself long ago that she wouldn't. She had told herself that this was the last thing that kept her truly human, that she would never wish it away, no matter how difficult of a burden it became to bear. But her humanity, even her desire for it, had long since been eclipsed by the shadows within. She had no humanity left to lose.\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, breathing heavily as she lay on the floor. In her mind she saw herself, the swirling darkness of despair surrounding her. It clawed at her eyes, ripped at her chest, forced its way into her soul until she was nothing but a shadow of a person. Nothing but the woman she was today.\n\nThen the shadow vanished. It appeared in her mind only for it to disappear moments later, as it had always been with her gift, her curse. Her heart alighted up to a perch of contentment, a perch that was coated in the dust of centuries. Despair, hopelessness, sorrow—all banished.\n\nShe turned over onto her back as she opened her eyes. Staring up at the cold lights above, something alien formed across her face—a smile, she soon realized. She couldn't remember the last time she had done that.\n\nShe may no longer be human, but at least she could smile.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1407823512","downs":0,"edited":"1407827476","gilded":0,"id":"cjnuqhk","link_id":"t3_2daghs","name":"t1_cjnuqhk","parent_id":"t3_2daghs","retrieved_on":1435194790,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"frndlynghbrhdknwitll","body":"Michael shook his head in disgust. *No, not disgust* he corrected himself, *pity.* But lately he never really can decide whether to be disgusted by or pitiful of the man his best friend was careening toward becoming. It felt stranger and stranger every day to call Kevin his best friend, with every bump, line, puff, drag, and swig driving a new wedge between them. Kevin was somehow able to hold on to a relatively well paying gig with at his record company, something about festival promoter liaison or vice live operations marketing director or some other ridiculous term Michael couldn't quite remember right now. So I suppose Kevin was what you could call a \"high-functioning\" addict, but Michael had never been sure that phrase ever meant anything. And besides, the job kept Kevin dangerously close to a lot of people with remarkably easy access to drugs--the real big pushers--and Michael knew that couldn't bode well for Kevin's future. \n\nTonight, Michael's expression of pity-disgust was prompted by his not-so-surprising discovery of Michael in the dilapidated \"guest house\" (really just a free-standing garage furnished with some futons, bean bag chairs, a long-broken 1950s fridge reincarnated as a liquor cabinet, and--oh god, is that a lava lamp?). A rollicking party was going on outside, it was a mutual friend's 26th birthday and Kevin had, unbelievably, convinced the year's musical act du jour--a brother and sister duo called hoegaarden who really looked to be on the way to triple platinum fame and fortune-- to perform, simply as a favor. Kevin always had these connections (magic tricks, really) up his sleeve, and it gave him kind of a superhuman persona. But Michael knew not everybody saw Kevin as Michael saw him now, seated around a coffee table made of an antique jukebox crushing a line of speed on a dirty mirror. Under the dim illumination of christmas lights and lava lamps, Michael could make out a bluish neck tattoo emerging from the shirt collar of one of the men gathered around the table, and a worryingly scarred forearm on the woman seated next to Kevin. *#BADWORDS#, that's a huge line of speed*. Michael knew Kevin could handle his drugs, and had seen him consume absurd quan#BADWORDS#es of speed before, but that was in a dressing room at The Fillmore in San Francisco with the night's headliners as the opening band built the crowd up just outside. Then it had felt exciting, like they were some artsy types in a West Berlin club in the late eighties. Now Kevin looked more pathetic junkie than music industry mover and shaker. The dirty mirror and lava lamp made Michael think of every movie scene he'd ever seen that included a smoking room at the back of a party.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1407970098","downs":0,"edited":"1407971267","gilded":0,"id":"cjpi6nm","link_id":"t3_2dfxbn","name":"t1_cjpi6nm","parent_id":"t3_2dfxbn","retrieved_on":1435223615,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":true,"author":"frndlynghbrhdknwitll","body":"Kevin and Michael had been nearly inseparable in high school, where, both passionate about science, they bonded at the back of a physics classroom. Kevin was the type of kid that made well-meaning parents cry and perceptive teachers angry. Possessing an unusually well developed vocabulary and a magnetic personality, he was constantly praised for his intelligence. This proved disastrous, as he internalized those comments as an affirmation of success and never devoted any effort to improving his intellect. He couldn't keep up in science or math or foreign language, but writing came so easily to him, as did support from friends, that he easily skated through high school without bothering to learn much that he didn't already know. Teachers that weren't fooled by his charm didn't take to the wasted potential image as well as his peers, though, and made fairly accurate predictions of drug haze he's probably fall into eventually. \n\nBack then, Michael and Kevin gleefully took part in what they called \"psychonautical adventures\" together--dropping acid in the botanical gardens, drug #BADWORDS#tails at a friend's ski cottage. These were experiments driven by a heavy curiosity regarding the nature of the human mind, and by the end of high school, Michael's curiosity was largely sated. Kevin, though, had developed a worrisome affinity for anything psychoactive. that was when the two had begun to grow apart. Now, with Michael finishing up his astrophysics graduate program and Kevin (who ascended the ranks of his career too quickly, and didn't see the need to finish even a paltry four years of collegiate education) getting strung out in a dingy room once again, Michael worried the distance between them would soon grow too great to bridge. \n\n\"Come on out, Kev, everybody's asking about you.\"\n\nKevin snorts the line and crushes another dime-sized off-white crystal. *Jesus, that's gotta be more than a gram.* but Kevin seems dissatisfied and pulls a glassine bag from his shirt pocket, adding some white powder to the pile. coke?\n\n\"In a minute, you want a bump Kev? My own special formula.\"\n\n\"Nah, I'm straight.\"\n\n\"What happened to you, man? We used to have so much fun!\"\n\n*#BADWORDS# #BADWORDS#.*\n\nFor the first time, Michael notices the scarred woman preparing a syringe of--*something*--using a dangerous looking piece of a tiki torch to dissolve god-knows-what in a s#BADWORDS#. This is not Michael's preferred company.\nMichael always thought that the proverbial cat had a better chance at surviving curiosity than his insatiable friend, what with the cat having nine lives and all. But sometimes it did seem that Kevin had already burned though nine lives and then some. The first time it was on vacation in Panama City, Panama, (a \"senior trip\" that seemed more dangerous in retrospect than it did at the time) Michael, Kevin, and their friends were working on buckets of local beer at a swim up bar when someone in their group issued a breath-holding challenge. Kevin was working through his bucket with astonishing rapidity, and working through quarter ounce of coke a local had given him as a #BADWORDS#r *(who gives a kid two goddamn eightballs as a free taste)* with even more alarming rapidity, and the others suspected that Kevin had also already consumed the gram of high grade MDMA he had no trouble sneaking past an easily sweet-talked TSA agent. Michael thought Kevin probably needed oxygen more than the others right now. But Kevin was compe#BADWORDS#ve, and not one to back down from a challenge. He breathed *out,* and quietly sunk to the bottom of the pool. After less than a minute the others had all come up, sputtering, laughing, gasping. Kevin had slipped under quietly, and, thoroughly intoxicated, the group didn't realize Kevin was silently smashing their breath-holding personal records. A full thirty minutes later, Michael asked Kevin something only to realize his friend was missing. Confusion. There he is on the bottom. Panic. He's dead. But Kevin, noticing his friends' distress, kicks off the bottom, smiling. Ascending peacefully, leaving the bottom of the pool like an angel ascending from the earth.\n\n\"Did I win?\"\n\nKevin remembers staring back, angry, scared, confused. Thirty minutes? That's just not possible. Nobody talks about this incident much, because though they know what they saw, they can't be sure it really happened. \nAnother time, in college, Michael had visited Kevin at his school--a notorious party school--for some heavy drinking. A frat party had exploded into a full blown riot, and the police had the whole place surrounded, assault rifles drawn. This seemed like an excessive response to Michael, but Kevin seemed unconcerned. Fleeing the party, an officer shouted at Michael to stop and raised his gun to his cheek.\n\n\"Don't stop, Mike!\"\n\nIt happened too fast. Kevin grabbed Michael's arm and kept running. The officer was squeezing the trigger now. *Stop, Kevin. we have to stop.* But now Kevin was in front of Michael. Michael heard two claps, saw Kevin silhoutted in the muzzle flash. Saw Kevin's head jerk back, saw him crumple to the ground. Saw the cop, maybe 23, maybe younger. Saw the look of horror on his face, saw him recognize himself as a killer. But then the look was gone, and Kevin was up and running, again, pulling Michael along, past the line of police, all the way to the safety of Kevin's apartment. \n\n\"Let me see where you're shot,\" Michael had said. But Kevin just laughed.\n\n\"You're ridiculous, man. I just tripped.\"\n\nMichael couldn't sleep that night, all he could think about was the motion of Kevin's head and the face on the cop. They weren't three feet from the gun, there's no way he could have missed. \n\nMichael had even seen Kevin buried in an avalanche during a winter hike, only to see him rise from the snow completely dry, without so much as a shiver.\n\nAs sure as Michael was of Kevin's ability to survive anything, he isn't so sure if he's quite so invincible himself, and he wants to get out of this junkie room as quickly as possible. Fate has other plans though, and while Kevin's head is lowered to the mirror, snorting the pile he had just offered Michael, Michael sees what Kevin doesn't. He sees heroin lady's tiki torch tip, spillling oil all around Kevin and setting the futon ablaze. He sees the obviously strung out lady swing around with her syringe, barely realizing what she's done, and catching Kevin in the jugular with the needle. The junkies are scrambling around, none of them look like they would know how to deal with a fire if someone handed them a hose. Right now, they have no hose, and one pours vodka on the blaze. This doesn't exactly rectify the situation. Now they are tripping over another in a clearly intoxicated manner, but with remarkable speed for the quan#BADWORDS#y of opiates presently in their system. Most people can move pretty fast when they're on fire, but Michael is watching Kevin move like he's relaxing at a sunday picnic. Kevin sits up calmly and sets down the rolled fifty on the table. He sits on his throne of flames so confidently that even the flames are deferent to him, caressing him instead of burning him. In this den of iniquity, he looks the spitting image of Shaitan or Hades. There's a dirty needle sticking out of his neck, but he's smiling like Hindu cattle in Mumbai. Before the panic sets in, Michael feels a twinge of anger. *This #BADWORDS# thinks he's invincible.* Kevin plucks the needle from his neck and flicks it aside as if it's no more than a spent cigarette. He rises, almost in slow motion, then, with the knowing hands of a professional landscaper, quickly sets up a sprinkler hose from the side of the garage. \n\n\"What the #BADWORDS#, Kev? Don't you think you're going to hurt yourself someday?\"\n\n\"Not really. Speed keeps that type of thought out of your head pretty damn well.\"\n\nHe didn't even look high.\n\n\"Are you sure you're alright?\"\n\n\"Never felt better.\"\n\nSlightly wet, Michael and Kevin left the confused junkies under the sprinkler and walked back out to the party.\n\n\"Those guys were pretty smelly anyway, probably best to let them wash off a bit.\"\nMichael couldn't understand how Kevin could joke like that so soon after a brush with death, but he didn't have time to ask. Natalia, the elder member of Hoegaarden, had spotted the slightly wet Kevin emerge from the garage. \n\n\"We love you guys a lot,\" she was saying from her perch on the backyard stage, \"but we especially love Kevin over there for inviting us!\" The whole party turned and cheered. Kevin waved to Natalia and put his arm around Michael, who was still slightly bewildered by his friend's impossible luck, and also more than a little frustrated that he wouldn't stop inserting himself into impossibly dangerous situations. \n\nUnable to tolerate these unpleasant thoughts, Kevin left Michael standing alone--and still totally soaked from the sprinkler--to skip over to a girl who might've been named Nancy, but might also have been named Hannah, he couldn't remember. NancyHannah was barely 5'2\" but easily commanded attention with a smile that could melt your heart. Her hair was black, but it was probably a dye job, as she had blue eyes so watery and bright that Kevin couldn't help but think about the color of the pool in Panama. She smiled at him, impressed by the adoration the partygoers had for Kevin. He could tell, though, that her smile was more amused skepticism than attraction. Normally Kevin wasn't much of a believer in love at first sight, but now he worried that NancyHannah might have the power to shake his faith. Kevin didn't ever want to leave the moment. *I'm in Heaven.*He thought.*I must have left my body and gone to Heaven.*\n\nBut then he had another thought. *maybe, just maybe, that's what happened all those years ago in the pool in Panama, and I've been there the whole time.*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1407970108","downs":0,"edited":"1407970553","gilded":0,"id":"cjpi6tq","link_id":"t3_2dfxbn","name":"t1_cjpi6tq","parent_id":"t1_cjpi6nm","retrieved_on":1435223622,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Eddie's voice was being stretched and elongated.\n\n\"Why do you want to shut it down?\" Joen asked still trying to blink sleep away from his eyes as he focused on the screen.\n\nJohn was opening his mouth so slowly now. Then the screen popped up slowing the moon, two relay sats and earth. Somewhere in the middle there was a big red X showing the data link was severed.\n\nThe ground shifted. Alarms rang and the worst possible sound you could hear off planet appeared. Air was rushing somewhere else.\n\nJohn made it to the emergency mask. A big plastic bag looking device that he tossed over his head and pulled tight around his neck. The thing inflated and he ran. forty seconds maybe. fifty at the most but he was panicking.\n\nThe corridor outside was split, that was bad. Very bad.\n\nSix hours later he stepped from the broken central shaft with the other survivors.

One of the injured must be on that channel because it was flooded with screaming wails. As he stepped into the light it all fell together.\n\nThe long slurred speech, the slowed time. The wormhole linking the research facility in Austin Texas with a tiny probe light years away. A gravty wave strong enough to shake the moon! They should have known.

Atmosphere bled off in swirls and whirls while molten lava from the center of what had once been earth spilled off into space.\n\nThere were no landmarks, the oceans as they were were lurching and erupting into the void where they were boiling off either from the vacuum or the heat.

{"archived":true,"author":"Syraphia","author_flair_text":"/r/Syraphia","body":"It was just poor luck and timing I guess that they got stuck here when the disease really broke out. It was poor luck for me too, trapped two thousand miles from home. I think I was lucky at the beginning that I didn’t get infected. Lucky for them too. Who would’ve thought that he could swing a guitar like a baseball bat and with just as much force. Wasn’t much left of the guitar after that, but he saved my life, along with a few others that night. \n\nThe concert was ruined of course. Small area with a few infected, a lot of people died that night. But not him, not me, and I stuck close by him. The rest of the band wasn’t quite so lucky, they lost the keyboardist and they weren’t sure if it was a bite or a cut on the drummer’s arm. He wasn’t too keen on showing it off either, what with the panic and all. There were a few other fans that had jumped onto the stage in fright instead of fleeing out the doors that stuck by too. \n\nOne of their interpreters got ripped apart, so that helped my sticking close chances. Not many people get to play translator for a foreign band, and it was a band I loved. Studying #BADWORDS#anese for years actually really paid off in a big way, kept us alive more often than I would’ve figured. Him speaking pretty good English kept us alive more often though he states that my language skills were essential too. He smiles every time he says it and I can’t help but smile back at him. \n\nThe drummer turned out fine. It really was just a cut thankfully. I don’t know what they would’ve done if he had turned. They’re all pretty close and it was nice to end up being with them on that after the second interpreter bit it. The remaining interpreter is a little more shaky on her English and even more skittish when it comes to danger, so we usually leave her holed up somewhere with a couple of the fans and other band members. \n\nWe got separated one time out scavenging for supplies and all the worst thoughts ran through my mind. I had a couple of the boys, concert-goers, with me and we searched through the town until we ran back into them. I could’ve squealed with happiness when I saw him, but the grim look on his face and one less person than had gone with him said something worse. It might’ve been petty of me, but I was thankful it was one of the concert-goers and not one of the band. He hugs me despite the loss, a rare show of affection, and I can only stammer like the fan girl I really was still deep down inside. \n\nI stayed on watch and kept an eye out for any wanderers when he joined me, looking off the balcony of the apartment we commandeered. Small talk wandered back and forth in hushed tones, languages mixing back and forth naturally. He flashes a smile that gets rarer as the days pass and I smile back, feeling my face ache as I do. I suppose my smiles were getting just as rare. It did feel like a hopeless situation. When someone relieves me of the watch for the night, he holds me for the night and calls me by his wife’s name a couple times as he sleeps. I’m sure I call him by my girlfriend’s name more than once. \n\nWe’re surviving surprisingly well. Even more so when we moved ourselves out of the city. We lost a couple of the staff and another concert-goer in that move, not the interpreter though. She’s getting better. We’re still holed up in places but the living’s gotten better in the suburbs surprisingly. We’ve got little gardens and a few of us took a long trip and managed to steal off with a couple, small, farm animals. We keep them a lot further away from the house due to the noise they end up making. You end up learning a lot when you used to live pretty rural and I am glad I had the knowledge to pass on to others. \n\nWhile he’s pretty good at fighting out a situation, other things make him squirm and make me laugh. The laughter makes him a bit happier it seems so I doubt he’ll be getting over any squeamishness any time soon and I don’t mind. I get to see him smile, it’s one of the best treats in the world for me. Occasionally, he holds me and we call each other by the wrong names while we sleep, trying to fill a void that we can’t possibly hope to overcome.

{"archived":true,"author":"corbeau_blanc","body":"Have you heard that phrase, \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\"? It's the best way to sum up the choice that lay before me. \n\nChances are, you've heard the news about this Ebola outbreak. It's spreading at a rate that no one had anticipated. They tried to find a cure, but people have been dying too quickly. Now our only hope is a vaccine. But vaccines take a long time to develop under the best of conditions. \n\nSo the Government, in their infinite wisdom, decided that people were going to be chosen at random to test the vaccine. At first people went willingly, everyone was determined to do their part to find a way to stop this disease. \n\nNobody come back from testing, dying painfully away from their families. My father had been among the third round to be vaccinated. As if that wasn't bad enough there has been six months of drafts and little progress. People are beginning to lose faith, myself included. \n\nThe last round of drafts caused rioting in the streets. Many people were killed by police and the rest were packed into vans, kicking and screaming, and taken to the testing facilities. \n\nIt was announced that anyone refusing the vaccines from now on would be exiled from the country. \n\nMy name came up last week. I have a few hours to come to a decision, face the vaccine (and probably die) or take my chances with Ebola in another country (and probably die).\n\nDamned if I do, damned if I don't. \n\nI took my time talking it over with my mother and my sister. They had been crying non-stop since my name was announced. But now they were calm, tears exhausted. They had no advice for me other than that they would support me either way and that they loved me. \n\nI want to scream.\n\nWhen they came for me, I held my head high and told them my decision. \n\nThey loaded me into the back of the second truck, slamming the gate closed behind me. I looked around at the others as I took a seat, their faces grim with the anticipation of what was to come for us. I recognised a couple of people, but we were too preoccupied with our misery to make small talk.\n\nMy sister ran down the street behind the truck, screaming my name. \n\nI closed my eyes. I had been too tense to sleep all week. But between the oppressive silence, the quiet hum of the truck engine and the swaying of the truck bed, I was lulled to sleep.\n\nI woke up to the truck being opened. We were finally at the testing facilities. \n\nI bet you're wondering why I chose this course. So I'll tell you straight up, it's not through some altruistic sense of doing my part or even to help save my family. It's to try and save myself. I'll take my chances with this vaccine because I don't like my chances with Ebola anywhere else. Devil you know and all that. \n\nI was logged into the system, given a room and strapped to a bed to await the vaccine. They're letting us record our thoughts while we wait, that's how you're reading this. \n\nI'm scared.\n\nIt's not long now; they said fifteen minutes ten minutes ago. That means five minutes before I begin my journey to death, or possibly life. \n\n---\n\nThey switched off the recording equipment while they stabbed me with the biggest needle I'd seen in my life, telling me what to expect in clinical medicalese. So now it's inside me, doing its work. \n\nMy arm is on fire, if I wasn't strapped to this bed I'd be scratching it raw. Probably why I am. I wish I'd taken the exile right now. My head's spinning. I'm going to try to get some sleep.\n\n---\n\nIt's been a few hours by my estimation. They came in just before to monitor me, which is why I'm awake. I'm not feeling so bad now, the heat has gone from my arm, but there's still a throbbing in my temples. \n\nI guess I should talk more about myself, but I don't know what to say. I'm no one special. I kept my head down and worked hard. Guess I'll have that put on my tombstone. \"Kept his head down, worked hard\". What a great epitaph. Too late to do anything about it now. My throat's aching so I'll try to rest some more. I guess I'll talk to you later, whoever you are. I hope you're better off than I am.\n\n---\n\nSo I'm not dead yet. Yay. It's been over a day. I guess that's good, the doctors looked surprised, which I'm taking to be a great sign. They rigged up a TV for me, I guess they don't go to that trouble to the people who die off quickly, that or they want me to have a relatively comfortable death. \n\nI wish they had better programs to watch, but if wishes were horses, beggars would ride, as my dad would have said. It sort of comforting to know that I'm near where he died. \n\n---\n\nI've been poked and prodded to within an inch of my life. It's now a week since this all started and I'm not dying. Which is unheard of apparently. I'm thanking my lucky stars. They're talking something about natural immunity and that my blood was the key to making the vaccine work. So maybe I'm not as ordinary as I thought. \n\nMaybe my headstone will now say \"Saved the World from Ebola\".","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1408084372","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjqt5x3","link_id":"t3_2dm00h","name":"t1_cjqt5x3","parent_id":"t3_2dm00h","retrieved_on":1435246984,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

They had gathered fibres from every hat they could find, now it was time to see if the struggle had been worth it.\n\"What should i play?\" whispered Gerald, almost as if he was speaking to himself.\n\"I don't know, you're the master here\" Carl replied with with a snide grin.\nGerald's eldery hand slowly brushed the thick layer of dust off the ivory. He touched the first key with a sense of uncertainty, causing the piano to moan with an ancient howl. Gerald could feel a tingling sensation in his spine. He couldn't help but grin. He started slowly at first, playing with just his right hand. Then as the melodies began to get more complex his other hand rose to the occasion. It was alchemy. Carl watched as his grandfather changed from a timid scholar into a passionate flame. His long arms, sweeping from side to side as his fingers flew across notes. The piano was so out of tune, it almost sounded like it was screaming in pain. There was something oddly human about it's cries. Despite the odd tones and battered notes it was the most beautiful music Carl had every heard. His grandfather had found a way to make this old cadaver sing. This is what it was to be a master. Watching the patriarch of his family sway to and fro, Carl had an idea. He slowly krept to the piano bench, standing just inches from his grandfather. If he was going to do this it had to be now. He threw his hands furiously around his grandfather's neck. \n\"You knew this was coming\" He muttered under his breath. \n\"Fool... have you forgotten what we created... what I created?\" Gerald immidiatley broke his grandson's hold around his neck and delivered a punch directly to Carl's chest, shattering his ribcage and destroying his organs. \n\"You think it so easy to usurp me boy?

Sitting on my lap, facing me, he signals to the s#BADWORDS#ched arteries in both of my legs. I often go days without thinking about them;  the fact that they're under my skin makes it easy to forget. But it always comes back to me, and now, so have they. \n\nI just wanted to be normal; to play and explore and learn about the world around me. I wanted to walk. They, the monsters, were also just like me;  bedridden. They too couldn't move freely about the world, confined to the shadow underneath me. I didn't like them, because they didn't like me. They would always taunt me in my dreams; giving me the power to run and jump and dance and live, only to break and bend my knees backward. I lived in constant fear of them and I wanted  an end to their hideous torment. \n\nOn one night, I couldn't walk. Of course I never could, but this time not even in my dream. I was simply laying in my bed, as I do day in and day out. I wanted to run, even if it meant having to stand the torture of the things under my bed. I was prepared to give anything for that little window of fictional freedom. And then they came to me. They too, only wanted this; freedom. They gave me a proposition; they would give me the ability to walk, and in return I would help them escape the darkness, when I became old enough.\n\nAnd I guess that's now; age seventeen. The bear withers into slivers of lint once I run my fingers across the s#BADWORDS#ches. Looks like I'll see them where I always have.\n\nLast night's dream was much more vivid than my usual ones, but the monsters have always made it so. I felt my body shiver in my dream, as well as when I had  woken up. The sweat was also real. Why didn't I see this coming...\nThe monsters, they don't have a physical body. And if they are to be freed from their abysmal binding, they must have one to inhabit. But all bodies are already occupied; some by other monsters. But if I am to remain walking, I will have to make a vacancy.\n\nThat night I don't sleep much. They want a body as soon as possible. And I intend to remain standing for as long as I live. I'm walking alongside the gutter. It's a large city, so there's plenty of homeless and forgotten to chose from. I see a small, frail, old woman slowly dragging her feet, making her way opposite  my direction. I scurry into an ally, and wait behind the corner for her to get within arm's length. I leap out from behind her and wrap my length of rope around her neck. I don't want to harm the body too much; after all, the monsters still need an able body for walking. She pushes me off and jumps out into the street, struggling to make her way across it. I jump after her, but freeze in place when I see something bright from the corner of my eye. I turn and I see nothing but two bright lights, and then nothing.\n\nI slowly, almost painfully, crack my eyes open. The bright headlights have now been replaced with a few above me, in the ceiling.

Bullets flew and blood spattered, but not for the sake of freedom, or power. As the small army reigned missiles upon their assailants vivid pictures of their fallen leader rushed through their heads. They remembered they're fathers which they never had the chance to bury. They looked around to see the faced of their fellow brothers in arms. They fought for the faces beside them. They fought for family, the only thing worth fighting for.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1408203168","downs":0,"edited":"1408203862","gilded":0,"id":"cjry1v2","link_id":"t3_2dq2xr","name":"t1_cjry1v2","parent_id":"t3_2dq2xr","retrieved_on":1435267490,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Ship her off to live with a bunch of pirates and fish mongers?  The awful stench of rotten fish was enough to turn her stomach. No amount of washing, nor mixture of fragrant perfumes, was enough to hide *that* smell. \n\nShe glanced at the source of that smell, her \"husband\", only to discover him leering at her, undressing her with his eyes.  It would be some small comfort if he were at least somewhat attractive.  Unfortunately, he reminded her of nothing so much as a toad, with his protruding eyes, and oily skin.\n\nShe gathered what supplies she could and left in the dead of night.

His face was crimson with rage.  He choked out some words, in a harsh guttural tongue, as he pointed his fingers towards the princess. \n\nA creaking of bone, and a twisting of tendon, followed the wizard's gestures.  The princess writhed in agony, as scales replaced skin, and fangs replaced teeth.  \n\nHe gave her an ultimatum: return to the castle as his bride, or remain a dragon forever.  The choice, was really no choice at all, for the princess.

{"archived":true,"author":"novimundus","body":"The skeletal jaw moved at a slow, solemn pace as the words reverberated in the underworld hall.\n\n“Well, Jack, it seems your time is up.”\n\nWhich was strange, because what was heard was a high-pitched valley-girlesque squeal that was out of sync with the jaw movements of death like a badly dubbed wuxia film. \n\nJack was confused just like I am, the omnipresent narrator, but hey, it’s Death. He does as he pleases. Or maybe she.\n\nHe fidgeted shyly from foot to foot, shifting the weights as he clasped his clammy hands behind his back and stared downwards, away from the monstrous skeleton that stood in front of him that wore a neon yellow tank top and black shorts with sandals on its bone feet. It was also riding what looked like the skeleton of giant-sized rodent.\n\nJack finally looked up. “I...guess so,” he stammered. Poor guy. Nobody deals with death well, except for narrators. But I guess that’s due to the implicit detachment of the situational fr-\n\nNevermind. Jack continued to fidget, and Death just kind of continued staring at him with his beady empty sockets. Finally, Death spoke again.\n\n“Okay...so...I couldn’t help but notice...that you’re a fan...of a certain game.”\n\nJack stopped fidgeting at the word “game” and perked up. The shy 10-year old who died from leukemia suddenly didn’t look so shy or infantile. He looked like a man. I’m kidding about the 10-year old leukemia thing, by the way. He was a 44 year old guy who died from a heart attack in his mom’s ba#BADWORDS#t playing world of warcraft.\n\n“What...game?” Jack inquired. He knew the answer.\n\nDeath tried to smile, but you can’t smile with bone.\n\n“The game of...”\n\nThere was a pause.\n\nJack stopped moving and we (Death, me, and Jack) waited with bated breath.\n\n“Pong.”\n\n“Pong!?” I yelled, incredulously, towards the reddit thread. Jack nodded. “Pong.”\n\nDeath tried to smile again, but no avail. \n\n“I’ll tell you what, Jack. I’m a big fan of World of Warcraft myself, especially with this new expansion, the #BADWORDS# Lords of Boehner, or whatever. If you can beat me in Pong, I’ll let you go back and live until the WOW servers go down, which should be in a year or two. Deal?”\nIt was confusing to hear all this while Death’s jaw clapped up and down rapidly, completely ignoring the slow pace at which the words were being emitted in a teenage girl’s voice. But Jack got the message.\n\n“Deal. Noob.”\n\nThe words stung, because Death growled, or tried to. Just imagine a high school cheerleader growling, and that’s about what it sounded like. \nNot very intimidating, largely laughable, and arguably pathetic.\n\nSuddenly, the world vanished, and my vision was replaced with a 2-dimensional plane where a small white circle was bouncing back and forth furiously between two sides which had little white bars. I realized then that this was the fabled, Pong.\n\nThe Pong-ing was intense, as the ball accelerated everytime it was deflected by the white bars. One of the bars had the label “J” on it, and the other “D”. The two were clearly skilled players, because each round would last several minutes, with the end looking like they were playing with many balls at once as the ball bounced back and forth so fast that my 2-dimensional vision suffered LED burnout.\n\nThe scoreboard rose just as fast, and with even greater volatility. At one point, I remember seeing Jack at 51 points, and Death at 11, and then I blinked and it was Death at 85 and Jack at 63. Time and space warped as the two paragons of pong played, and aliteration altered all atypical assessments. \n\nSuddenly, the screen turned white, and I was staring at the words, “game over”, written in a very ugly type face, probably comic sans. I glanced at the score: Jack, 100, Death, 101.\n\nWait. WHAT?! Death WON? Who sets the target score to 101?\n\nIt didn’t matter. Suddenly we were back at that underworld hall, and Jack, the pudgy, bespectacled 44-year old fatass, suddenly had the floor underneath him open up, and scrawny, impoverished hands pulled him down into the flames as he screamed.\n\nDeath looked at me. I looked back at him.\n\n“You’re lucky you’re just a narrator.”\n\nYes. Yes I am. I would never want to suffer the fate of Jack. Forced to be an IT technician for a retirement home for all of eternity. Good thing my favorite game is Chess.\n\n“Chess, you say?”\n\nAw #BADWORDS#.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1408296264","downs":0,"edited":"1408296568","gilded":0,"id":"cjstgkw","link_id":"t3_2dq92a","name":"t1_cjstgkw","parent_id":"t3_2dq92a","retrieved_on":1435285034,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Surprisingly this isn't the worst thing that's ever happened to me, but damn it's still as embarrassing as those years ago. \n\nNote to self: don't forget your keys next time you sunbathe nude.\n\nC'mon George, you're a smart guy, you can figure out how to break into a house.

I look up at the void that is the dark night sky and let a low hum. Only a few stars can be seen twinkling in comparison to the plethora of city stars from below. The orange dim glow of the lights make my eyes droop, reminding me of the time. I slow my pace and let the gentle night breeze caress my skin, sending playful shivers down my spine. Finally, I stop and gaze up, then down again.\n\nI let out a sigh of appreciation nonetheless for the lights, fake or not. A small smile sneaks its way on my lips and I can't help but remember when I walked a similar trail with my partner a year ago. We used to walk above the city lights but always below the stars. It felt like walking in limbo. We were in a world of our own being sandwiched between humanity below and the infinite skies above. I remember the talk of our future together, the endless possibilities, the laughter, tears and jokes in this small space. It felt as if nothing could destroy this world we created together. \n\nBut that was a year ago when he was still a part of this world. I stuffed my numb fingers into my pockets and quickened my pace. Suddenly, the night wind seemed to nip mockingly at my skin as I begin my descend down the hill towards my home in the city.

It's heavier than it looks. \"Then a crawler got Jim and he got Mom and suddenly I was on my own.\" \n\n\n\"How'd you get the sword?\" I asked\n\n\n\"Found a ba#BADWORDS#t. Had loads of them in it. Guess it was some nut cause they all had little labels underneath them with names. This one's called Elendil.\" \n\n\"Er -\" \n\n\"So I took it and I was living with a bunch of guys for a while in the old subway tunnels, because back then they still had power running through the third line? So the Risers would step on it and bam! Riser popcorn. Smokey.\" She cackles like a mad woman. \"Anyway, they all got a bit weird when I got older. They used to be cool and then-\" her face becomes stony. \"I don't know. I don't like talking about it. What about you?\" \n\n\n\"There was my mom and me. My dad wasn't in the picture.\" As I say it, it's like I'm reliving it all over again. Emergency school closure, we'd all been turned out into the streets but someone had got our bus driver so there were about thirty of us with no way to get home. There were sirens screaming, back when the police were pretending to do something to help and the shops across the road were getting ransacked. \n\n\n\"I don't know why,\" I continued. \"But I had this awful feeling in my stomach, like I knew something was going to happen and I- So I ran home.\" The door was already smashed open and my mother was slumped on the sofa in the living room, back to me. There was a tiny hole in the back of her head and the blonde of her hair was red. \n\n\n\"Mom?\" My voice had sounded broken. \"Mom, mom?\" I circled round her. Where her face had been was an explosion of red gristle, exposed skull shattered around her left eye. I could see teeth through the hole where her nose had been. \n\n\n\"Mom, no.\" \n\n\n\"They'd taken the TV and all her jewellery.\" I explained to Annabelle, who had her hand clapped over her mouth. \"It wasn't even a  Riser, just a neighbour who'd wanted what we had.\" \n\n\nI stifled a hysterical laugh. \"They took the TV! In the middle of a #BADWORDS# Rising! I couldn't-\" My laughter sounded scarily close to tears and I choked it down. \n\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Annabelle said. \n\n\n\"No, don't... It's war, isn't it?\" \n\n\nWe were on the old I-5. The UNARF renamed it, but I can't remember what they decided on in the end. There was a contest to decide the name... They broadcast details of it on the old survival radios you had to tune yourself. 91.1 fm. It was supposed to be like the old times, but no one cared any more. Around us stretched desolate miles of parked cars, open trunks popped and looted all the way from Portland to Tacoma. All the fuel's been siphoned out and it's one massive death trap: light a match and they'll go up around you. Annabelle had come down here on her way out of Forks. \n\n\n\"The road's clear.\" She'd said. \"I wouldn't usually use them, cause the Risers hide in cars, but it's the fastest route and there's a UNARF patrol that usually comes round here and guns things till it's empty. They say when they get the manpower, they'll shift the vehicles, but-\" \n\n\nShe shrugged. The UNARF - United Nations Anti-Riser Force was created when the US basically lost control of every state south of Carolina. They have patrol groups in most northern states, and disjointed armies working further south. Last i heard they'd got Tennessee and Oklahoma more or less Riser-free. \n\n\nBut there was a rattling moaning coming from a chevy up ahead. Scratched blue paint, bullet holes in the back doors and the trunk popped. \n\n\n\"Is there any point in us being quiet?\" I asked. \"It's already heard us.\" \n\n\nAnnabelle shook her head. \"The moaning will call any others in the area. Come on.\" \n\n\nHer sword was already out, and a second later my machete was too. Gotta separate the head from the neck, head from the neck. It was like a mantra I told myself any time I thought one would get close. \n\n\"You, left. I'll go right door. Stay low. It might not have seen us yet.\" \n\n\nI squeezed past a low sedan on my left, crouched almost double against the blue door of the chevy. My heart was racing, both hands wrapped around my machete. Annabelle gave the signal, two raps against the door of the car and I stood up, pulling the door out. It smacked sharply into the sedan next to it and I jumped, but there was no danger. The Riser was still strapped into his seatbelt, face rotted away in peeling yellow strips of skin, black gore showing underneath. Its eyeballs had been eaten and it flailed backwards and forwards against the restrictions, moaning and rattling away. Hands scratched the passenger seat as it lunged towards me, before the locking mechanism of the belt kicked in and held it back. My hands were shaking. \n\n\n\"You okay?\" Annabelle asked, leaning over the Riser's shoulder. \"You want to kill it?\" \n\n\nI nodded. So far Annabelle was three up on me and I didn't feel like her being much better at killing Risers than me was going to make me look good. So I leant in and lopped off its head with one clean stroke. The head fell onto the steering wheel, no blood, only black ooze. \n\n\n\"Good, good.\" She said happily. \"That should do it.\" \n\n\nWe backed away from the car, high fived a little awkwardly. That's when the moaning started. \n\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1408733563","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjxowx9","link_id":"t3_2e9h5l","name":"t1_cjxowx9","parent_id":"t1_cjxczl9","retrieved_on":1427406687,"score":57,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":57}

Still, the man wouldn’t open the door to his cab, and George, getting impatient, decided to do so himself.\n\n“Come on, I don’t have all day, you gonna get in or what?”\n\nThe man responded, in a strained, rigid accent George could not pinpoint.\n\n“What is this creature you control?\n\n“Is this a joke? It’s a taxi.”\n\nA look of approval appeared to flicker across the strange man’s face, and he entered the car and sat down.\n\n“So where are you going?”\n\nThe man looked at George as if he hadn’t heard him.\n\n“Taximan, it is your lucky day, for I am Lightman, able to move unseen at a speed as fast as light. With the injuries I have sustained from a war on my home planet, I will not be able to live much longer...unless I can pass my powers on to someone like you! Do you accept?”\n\n“You’ve got to be kidding me, is this another one of those stupid scams? A prank? Am I on video right now?”\n\n“I can assure you this is no joke, Taximan.”\n\n“Listen, I appreciate the effort really. You’ve made my day, but go promote your movie, or whatever this is, somewhere else.”\n\n“Seriously, I need you to accept, there’s not much time. If you don’t take these powers I’ll disintegrate into nothing more than light particles! Please!”\n\t\n“I’ll let you off here, and my name is George for god’s sake. Now get out of my cab.”\n\t\nLightman reluctantly exited the taxi, preparing to confront what he knew was his rapidly approaching fate.\n\t\nGeorge pulled away from the curb of his strange encounter, checking his rear view mirror to get one last glance at “Lightman.” But where Lightman had stood seconds before, he could only see a bright flash of light dispersing throughout the street. Tourists and passersby stood entranced by the brilliant spectacle, which was followed by shimmering particles of golden dust falling to the ground like snow.\n\t\nGeorge sighed, “This city gets crazier and crazier everyday.”\n\t\nTurning right onto the next street, he decided to head towards Times Square. The tourists there were always giddy customers, but at least they weren’t delusional.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1408737922","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjxr618","link_id":"t3_2e9jls","name":"t1_cjxr618","parent_id":"t3_2e9jls","retrieved_on":1427405623,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Studies have shown sociopaths have a \"empathy switch\" in their brains. It is often set to off but in certain situations they are capable of turning it on, usually in situations where they are asked to imagine the physical pain of another. While most of these experiences are rare, they do occur every now and then in a sociopath's lifetime. It is this \"switch\" that is part of their ability to be so charming to those they prey on. So the first time (in most cases) they felt their selective empathy would be in their childhood and they would be confused for a short time, then gain control over their new weapon.

{"archived":true,"author":"trrh","body":"In 1957, the USSR launched the first man-made satellite into space.  It’s name was Sputnik.  It emitted a beeping noise on the 20.005 and 40.002 MHz frequencies.\n\nApproximately fifty-seven light years away and fifty-seven years in the future, classes were beginning at D’underberg Community College, located in D’underberg, D’underberg on the planet D’underberg, which was at the very westernmost edge of the Galactic Federation.\n\n“Greetings, students,” Professor Bob said, “I hope all of you enjoyed your summer vacations.”\n\nThe students looked back at him, bored.  Most of them looked like six foot tall reptiles, or two-headed blue people, or pink sharks with legs.  But a few of them, like the professor, were Ethereals.  Their beings existed in a dimension that barely intersected with our own.  \n\nThis was very inconvenient for the corporeal aliens, so the Ethereals had been pressured to pick holographic avatars.\n\nGiven this choice, MOST species of aliens would have picked a variety of avatars that reflected their personalities. Aggressive people would probably choose intimidating avatars, friendly people would choose approachable avatars, and so on.\n\nBut apparently things were quite different in the Ethereals’ home dimension, because all Ethereals universally picked the same avatar: a Jellyfish.  It was always the same Jellyfish, too.  They had to wear nametags.\n\nThe jellyfish with the nametag “Professor Bob” floated in the air next to a podium at the front of the lecture hall.\n\n“This is Nuclear Fission 101,” Professor Bob droned on, “If you’re in the wrong class, then please feel free to stand up and leave now.”\n\nNo one stood up to leave.  One of the bipedal pink sharks began to snore softly.\n\n“Now some people think that Nuclear Fission is boring,” Professor Bob droned, “But I don’t.  Nuclear Fission isn’t boring, because…”\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\nMillions of miles away, Sputnik’s radio signals were passing through an asteroid belt West of Dunderberg.\n\n“It’s not boring because… well, it’s a required class for History majors,” Professor Bob said, “So even if it is a little boring…”  He paused again.\n\nSputnik’s radio signals were much closer now, penetrating into the planet D’underberg’s atmosphere.\n\n“Anyway,” he said, “Webster’s Intergalactic Dictionary defines Nuclear Fission as, “the process by which a nucleus is split.””\n\nHe stopped to look at the class.  \n\n“Does anyone have any questions or comments?” he said.\n\nSilence.\n\n“Would anyone like to react to that definition?” he said, “Maybe if you raise your hand, we could have a discussion about what nuclear fission means to you?”\n\nSilence.  This was going to be a tough class, Professor Bob thought.  He was trying to use the Socratic method goddammit!  Why didn’t anyone participate?\n\nAnd then, suddenly the radio transmissions from Sputnik arrived.\n\n“EEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHLEEE #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS#,” Professor Bob screamed.\n\n“#BADWORDS# #BADWORDS# OUCH #BADWORDS# OWW PAIN GOD MY EYES!” An Ethereal student in the front row shouted.\n\nThe sleeping pink shark #BADWORDS# awake.  Why were these Ethereals shouting all of a sudden?  Eveyone else seemed to be fine.\n\n“GODDAMMIT THAT HURTS!” A Jellyfish-shaped Ethereal in the back row shouted, “#BADWORDS# #BADWORDS#ITTY #BADWORDS#, THIS PAIN IS INTOLERABLE!”\n\nProfessor Bob tried to compose himself, but the pain was unbearable.  He meant to say, “Pardon me students, I’m not sure what is happening,”  but the only words he could form were, “#BADWORDS# ON MY #BADWORDS# HOLY #BADWORDS# CACTUS IN MY ASS THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL #BADWORDS# THING #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS# I’M DYING #BADWORDS# OW!”\n\n“Hey,” the bipedal pink shark said, “Hey Professor,”\n\n“WHAAAAT?” Professor Bob screamed, “#BADWORDS# #BADWORDS# OW OW #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS# OW, WHAT DO YOU WANT?”\n\n“Professor,” the shark continued, “Are you okay?”\n\n“#BADWORDS# NO,” the professor let out a blood-curdling scream.\n\nJellyfish all over the room were collapsing and screaming hysterically.\n\n“So, uh,” the shark said, “Is class cancelled or what?”\n\n“#BADWORDS#!” Professor Bob screamed, “CALL AN AMBULANCE!”\n\n“I’M DYING OH GOD I’M #BADWORDS# DYING!” a Jellyfish in the back row screamed.\n\nThe shark said, “Okay professor, the ambulance is coming.”  He paused, waiting for Professor Bob to respond.  But Professor Bob just flopped on the floor, moaning quietly.\n\n“So,” the shark said, “Can we go now?”  He looked around the room nervously.  All of the Jellyfish were flopping around in agony, but everyone else seemed to be okay.\n\n“#BADWORDS#!” Professor Bob screamed one more time.\n\nThe shark exchanged glances with a six foot tall reptile.\n\n“Do you think we can leave now?” the shark asked, “or is he going to take away attendance points?”\n\nA two-headed blue alien said, “I think we can go.”\n\nAnd so the six-foot-tall reptiles, the two-headed blue people, and the bipedal pink sharks packed their pencils and notebooks into their knapsacks and quietly filed out of the room, leaving the Ethereal Jellyfish to flop around helplessly and scream expletives.\n\nSputnik’s signals continued for 22 days.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1408979362","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cjzzs7e","link_id":"t3_2egh23","name":"t1_cjzzs7e","parent_id":"t3_2egh23","retrieved_on":1427367133,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

He clicked on the scroll down button over and over.\n\n\"Where are you,\" he said outloud.  Click, click, click. Then a pause.\n\nHe froze as he stared at a tiny line of code. His hand went reflexively to it and he tapped the line of code over and over.  \n\n\"Holy #BADWORDS#,\" he yelled.  \"Holy #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS#.\"  He picked up his phone and dialed a number.  A red light appeared on the phone's body that read, \"Secure.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the voice on the other end.  \n\n\"Uhh its Tom from forensics, my boss said to call you if I found anything from the code dump.\"\n\nThere was a long pause. \"Yes, go on.\"\n\nTom rubbed his eyes for a moment. \"I don't know you, umm how do I say this, are you familiar with Shannon's law and quantum theory?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, these guys got clever, they opened a subatomic portal using the casimir effect. Very tricky, but they figured it out, but its very tiny. Like one photon at a time tiny.\"\n\n\"We already know this. Our lawyers know this.\"\n\n\"But they can't push matter, so what did they do? They sent ultra-compressed 3D scans of objects through. On the other end they...\"\n\nThe voice on the other end added, \"... printed it out and then destroyed the original.\"\n\n\"Yes! That's exactly it. The code proves this. They had a fancy 3D fab and hid it from everyone.\"\n\n\"So... the teleported items are just perfect copies.\"\n\nTom paused, \"Its impossible for them to be perfect.  You know Heisenberg and all that. This explains why everything sent over was a little messed up. Teleportation damage my ass.\"\n\n\"They teleported people you know.\"\n\n\"I uh didn't know. I know this sounds crazy but these guys must have a bioprinter with human level resolution then.  I guess it was more profitable to get into the teleport business than the bioprinting business.\"\n\n\"Instant money maker,\" said the voice. \"If they told the world it was a medical device they'd have to wait 10-15 years for approval. Instead they made up this teleport business and cashed out.\"\n\nTom heard shuffling of papers on the other end. \"594 people,\" said the voice. \"They teleported 594 people.\"\n\nTom gulped and said, \"594 cases of murder.\" \n\n\"No, they didn't destroy the originals in those cases. They locked them up on an on-site brig to avoid the death penalty if they were caught. These people were only discovered recently.\"\n\n\"What,\" said Tom. \"So these guys have clones?\"\n\n\"No Tom, we're clones.  I went through, you're my copy. You don't remember because of the flaws. The bioprinting was good, but not good enough. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Wait, what? What the #BADWORDS# man, this isn't funny.\"\n\n\"Look, there's no way around this. Your flaws are getting worse.  You won't survive longer than the next few months.

Hiring you was the only way around the NDAs and legal issues.  I'm sorry this happened to us. I... I just had to let you know.\"  The man on the other hand started weeping.\n\nThe phone hung up and Tom sat there holding the receiver. He coughed and put his hand up to his mouth quickly.

{"archived":true,"author":"normalcypolice","body":"The machines used an enormous amount of power. I'd always been a bit curious about that myself, but I'm just a level-1 repair tech. Mostly I just clean the machine out. Empty the filters and look over the wiring a bit. But still, it inspires confidence. People like to know that all their bits and pieces are going into a machine that's regularly serviced. They like having a number to call in case of minor problems. And again, most of the repairs are fairly light. I don't typically crack a look at the internal structure, though I'd been briefed on it in training, obviously. \n\nOne day I got this call from a machine out west- he's not porting. It was probably an issue with the scan card - we see it all the time. \n\nJust in case that machine did have a problem though, I ported to one in the regional tech center nearby, going the rest of the way by cab. Slow, but cheap. Ten minutes later I was at the square. \n\n\"I've been waiting here ten minutes, what took you so long?\" the guy snapped. \"I'm sorry, sir, but you know protocol for potentially buggy machines.\" \n\n\"But it's not a buggy machine!\" he pointed at the booth, where there was a blue flash, followed by a woman exiting. \"People have been coming in and out just fine. It's something with me.\" \n\nI raise an eyebrow. Unusual for an end-user to understand that they're the problem. \"Would you mind trying again, if you feel comfortable?\" \n\nHe rolled his eyes but swiped the card through the reader, which flashed green. The door opened and he stepped inside. So far, so good. \n\nHe keyed in the code for his destination. The whole thing glowed, made a hum, but then nothing happened. \n\nHe stepped outside. \"It just gives me an error code. No matter where I try to go.\"\n\n\"Maybe you were trying to access a busy terminal? I know that the ones in New York can be congested for up to five minutes at peak times-\" \n\n\"I was trying to go to Juno, Alaska. I'm not an idiot.\" \n\nI opened the back hatch to find the error readouts. The history log showed multiple attempts from his ID, trying to go to different stops. All of the codes were correct. The only mystery was the error code. \"USER ERROR 401\" \n\nI'd heard rumors of it, but nothing too concrete. It always seemed to be associated with high-use accounts. I was supposed to pass the ticket upwards at this point; a 401 error code is beyond my training, and definitely above my clearance, but I can't deny I was intrigued. \n\n\"Mister...\" \n\n\"Sandoval. Abram Sandoval.\" \n\n\"Mister Sandoval. Have you ever experienced problems with the porting tech before? Do you remember when your last successful trip was?\" \n\n\"Look. I must use the machine about a few hundred times a day. More, sometimes, when I do the grocery shopping. France for cheese, Italy for olives, all that junk.\"\n\nI pause. That can't be right. Most cards will only give you around ten trips a day. \"Are you sure that's safe? The volume of travel may be upsetting your molecular makeup, making it difficult for the machine to read...\"\n\nHe sees the confusion on my face and chuckles. \"I was one of the earliest adopters of the tech. Back when they issued unlimited passes, you know? Anyway, I'm a runner. I do deliveries. Have done for years. I think my record was about 5,000 runs in a day. Christmas Eve, a couple years back? Never had a problem then. The card must be glitching or something. Can you...I don't know, clear the cache? Turn it on and off again? Get me a new account?\" \n\nHe handed me his card and I had an idea. \"Can I test something really fast?\" \n\nHe shrugged. \"That's why you're here, isn't it?\" \n\nI scanned his card. Got the green light and stepped in the booth. Punched in the code for Juno. I step outside the booth. Yup, that's Alaska.

{"archived":true,"author":"Vilvos","body":"One morning, when Gregory Sanders woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed into his bed.\n\nGregory didn't immediately realize his transformation; at first, he thought he'd tangled himself up in his sheets. But as he tried to untangle himself, he realized he'd somehow *become* his sheets, his bed—he could even feel himself in the carpet around his bed. Gregory panicked, screamed, flexed muscles he no longer had as he tried to pull himself out of his prison. But he couldn't scream, he couldn't move; he could only be the sheets, the bed, the carpet. Gregory's panic swelled, his mind full of buzzing bees, full of static; he lost consciousness.\n\nNow he could feel himself in the carpet outside his bedroom, in the hallway, in the staircase bannister. How much time had passed? He thought he remembered hearing his phone ring, but it didn't matter; he couldn't've answered. He could feel himself spreading down the staircase, his consciousness spilling down the stairs, trickling down the bannister. He didn't feel the panic he'd felt earlier, but he felt like sleeping—or rather, he felt like not-being, since he doubted he could still \"sleep\" like he'd slept as a man.\n\nGregory stopped not-being and resumed spreading himself: Gregory became the downstairs carpet, the kitchen appliances; he poured himself down the drains, filled each crack in the hardwood floors. But he needed to rest again, to not-be...\n\nDarkness, but he could feel the sun on his roof! Something had happened. Gregory flexed his consciousness, strained, and turned on a lamp—but no light, still darkness! He couldn't hear his refrigerator humming. He couldn't feel electricity in his outlets. Electricity! He'd been turned off! Gregory remembered now, remembered being human and paying bills with bill-paying-paper and bill-paying-plastic. He needed to feel electricity in his outlets again, needed to hear his refrigerator hum! Bill-paying-paper! Gregory needed to find—\n\nKnocking! Door-knocking! Gregory focused himself into his door. No, not door-knocking! Door-hammering! Door-piercing! Metal-in-door-pain! Gregory could remember a similar man-pain, a pain caused by a splinter under his fingernail. Something had been hammered into him! Paper hanging from his door! He could hear voices leaving his door. He pressed himself against the paper, tried to make sense of the backwards sound-shapes on the paper: E-V-I-C—no, he couldn't understand the backwards sound-shapes, he couldn't understand the painful paper nailed to his door! Gregory needed to be not-panicking, to rest until he became strong enough to push the nail out of his door...\n\nHow long had Gregory not-been? Too long! He could feel vibrations in his foundations, could hear man-sounds outside. No, not just outside, but inside! Man-sounds inside him! Gregory could feel men in his kitchen, could feel men in his ba#BADWORDS#t-bowels, men moving inside him like parasites! *Leave!* screamed Gregory; he tried to make man-sounds but he couldn't. But the man-sounds left, the men left! Silence! Empty! Gregory's fear began leaving—\n\nThe crane's claw began tearing Gregory apart.\n  \n* * * * * * *\n\n\"Nothing says 'new house' like old furniture!\" laughed a man-voice.  \n\"Oh, it's just made to look old; my friend made it from scrap wood\", said another man-voice.  \nGregory began spreading himself.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409028615","downs":0,"edited":"1409028903","gilded":0,"id":"ck0nnia","link_id":"t3_2elh1t","name":"t1_ck0nnia","parent_id":"t3_2elh1t","retrieved_on":1427355795,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Groaning I lifted myself from my beanbag chair and dusted some cheeto from my chest. Fingers touched my mouth and I realized that definitely wasn't the taste of cheeto, but it did happen to be orange.\n\n Shaking my head and spitting slightly I moved towards the bathroom and rubbed my eyes. I wasn't sure what day it was, but summers had kind of been like that since dad lost his job, which kinda happens by default when you die. So no more baseball camps or track camps or clam camp which was by far my favorite. Nope, instead I get to do nothing all summer except for once every few weeks when my mom finds a new man to...I'm just gonna stop right there.\n\nAnyway I'm outside now. When did that happen exactly? I dunno. Anyway I got this postcard in my hand, #BADWORDS#uely remember it's kinda important. My hair is wet and droops across my face which is annoying, I'd never have that problem in Skyrim...wait no theres a mod for that. Anyway blue box, opening the blue box, about to put the letter in the blue box, stopping just in time because this letter is not destined for the blue box because it doesn't have a stamp and letter piracy is illegal. \n\nI scratch my head wondering why this was important again. Eventually I get pretty tired of being wet and oddly enough I'm thirsty which is weird because whenever I see rain and waterfalls I usually have to go to the bath...no wait there it is. Okay well after I settled that 'business' I see they're serving hot tea in...wherever this place is. I don't like tea, but that doesn't matter cause it's on sail and I'm poor because the economy.\n\nDrinking my #BADWORDS# tea when I notice a girl across from me sitting alone with a laptop, I hear the sounds coming out of it and notice they're familiar, I walk past for a refill and see she's playing Skyrim. I think that's neat, what isn't neat is this place doesn't have free refills. I turn around and the girls is disconnecting her laptop and leaving. Realizing I may never have a chance to see this woman who shares the interest of an extremely popular video game I spring into action by producing a baseball bat and bludgeoning her to death. I spill my hot tea on my face and the police come. As I'm being carted away I remember the letter and open it hoping it will provide some context but all it is is a picture of #BADWORDS#butt.\n\nstay in school kids.

{"archived":true,"author":"Maniacbob","body":"“I wondered when you’d show up,” Commissioner Jim Gordon said as he drew the cigarette stub from his lips and stared at it for a moment before dropping it with the others and crushing it. “I wondered who you’d show up as.”\n\n“I need to talk to him,” Batman said as he stepped out of the shadow behind Gordon.\n\n“I know.” Gordon opened his tan overcoat and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. The few remaining rattled against the inside. “I know,” he repeated. “He’s been under tight watch since he arrived. Handpicked crew. I’ll have them cleared out and the cameras turned off. It’ll just be you and him in there.”\n\n“Thanks Gordon.”\n\nEven as he watched him walk past Gordon couldn’t hear his boot against the cold concrete or his cape rustle as it moved like he was a shadow or perhaps a ghost. “How can it be that the right course of action feels this wrong?” Gordon asked as he walked away.\n\nBatman paused. “Because it’s not right, but maybe it is just.”\n\nGordon slid a fresh cigarette from the package and lit it. “I hope so.” He looked up as he put the pack back into his pocket but the shadows were just shadows again.\n\n\nThe room was probably the most secure one that the Joker had ever been held in. Of course, given a few more hours and few fewer eyes watching him and he’d have weaseled his way out of it. Even now he was examining in detail every nook and cranny. He had watched, timed, and memorized the movements and actions of all the guards. He had noted every camera position and angle. Chaos only gets you so far, some things just require a plan. Like breaking out of jail, one of the few things the Joker ever planned and also one of his favourite hobbies behind explosions, fires, killing, maiming, destroying, and driving people to madness. The Joker was closing in on a plan, there was just one variable missing and then it walked in through the door.\n\n“I wondered when you’d show up,” the Joker sneered. The split lip made the sight even more unnerving but Batman was unfazed. “What’s the matter, Bats? You look like something the cat just threw up. We haven’t even gone a few rounds yet.” The Joker raised his fists in front of his face and took a few practice jabs at the air. The chain connected his wrists to the bench rattled as he moved.\n\n“How many people have you killed?” Batman asked. The Joker was unsure of what to make of the question. “Can you even remember? How many will you kill tomorrow?” The Joker laughed but the Dark Knight had heard him laugh so many times that he recognized uncertainty and apprehension in it. It was a pretence he was putting on. “I know that there will be bodies tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that too. Mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters that you’ll leave dead in your wake simply for your own amu#BADWORDS#t. I know that, and I still argued on your behalf.” It was Batman’s turn to laugh.\n\nIt was an eerie sound that set the Joker on edge. The Joker had never heard Batman laugh before and it was clear that he didn’t do so often.\n\n“For what?” The Joker asked nervously. He was used to the one holding the cards, being mysterious, making others ask questions. He was not on comfortable ground.\n\n“Your life,” came the answer. “I actually fought to spare your life. After everything you’ve done and in spite of everything you will do, I pe#BADWORDS#oned them to not kill you. And I lost.”\n\nThe Joker began to laugh again as he imagined Batman on his knees pleading for his life in front of a panel of judges. “Is that all?” he asked through fits of laughter. “I was almost worried.”\n\nBatman slouched backward against the heavy steel door and sighed. With one hand he slowly reached up and gripped the peak of his cowl and dragged it forward. The Joker watched with horrified interest as the fabric slid across the face and revealed the chiselled façade of Bruce Wayne. The Joker had spent countless hours trying to figure out the iden#BADWORDS#y of the man beneath the mask and Wayne’s name had always been high on the list but to see the uncovered face staring at him from the suit still somehow shocked him.\n\n“Even now I’m part of me wants to break you out of here,” Bruce Wayne said, his voice barely a whisper. “No, that part needs to save you. You’ll love this, I’m sure, whatever I choose will haunt me for the rest of my life. Do I go against everything I’ve ever fought for and let a man I could have saved die, perhaps even be complicit in his death, or do I turn on the people of this city who I have defended and who you will kill first chance you get? If I do nothing I doom you to die and if I act I doom hundreds to die.”\n\n“Why did you come here?” The Joker asked.\n\n“Looking for a reason, I suppose, or maybe a sign. An excuse maybe.”\n\n“Now you have to choose who dies,” The Joker said with a giggle. “I read about your parents when it happened. Shot in an alley. And now you’re the one calling the shots.

{"archived":true,"author":"Dr_Will_C_Yew","body":"Daimyo Choukichi looked over his camps as his men prepared for their assault on Kishiwada Castle. His horse whinnied and stamped, and he jostled a bit, bringing it back under control. The tents stretched over vast quan#BADWORDS#es of land, and fires littered the ground. The army milled about, some sitting and sharpening their swords, while others cooked food over the fires. They were tense, but not afraid, just calm. That was good. Calm was good. None of them knew. Suddenly footsteps pattered from behind him and he turned, as an out of breath messenger ran up the hill. Bowing, he quickly took a breath before speaking,\n\n\"Choukichi-san! Shogun Eito is coming to speak with you!\" Choukichi's eyes widened, and he nodded.\n\n\"Thank you.\" I shall meet him in my tent.\" The messenger shook his head.\n\n\"No, he's coming up the hill! I ran to give you some warning!\" Choukichi inhaled sharply and quickly dismounted. \n\n\"Thank you.\" The messenger bowed and quickly ran back down the hill. As he left, another horse trotted up, a large figure on it's back. That man was the future shogun of #BADWORDS#an. Shogun Eito; the general of the Minamoto rebellion, the man who took Edo with losing a single soldier, who brought Owari under control in four months. And the figure certainly matched the name. He was a tall man, at least six feet, and muscular, wide broad shoulders heavy with muscle that were said to have broken even the toughest blades. His armor only added to his towering figure. Black yori coated his chest, the red mon of the Kawachi Genji across his armor, his kabuto, two large spiraling golden horns. \n\n\"Eito-sama.\" Choukichi said, bowing very deeply. The other man dismounted, his yori rattling and clinking. \n\n\"Hello Choukichi.\" The daimyo was taken aback. \n\n\"Pardon?\" Eito shook his head,\n\n\"Do not bother with honors.\" Choukichi frowned,\n\n\"Eito-dono-\" The shogun held up his hand for silence,\n\n\"Don't. I wish to speak. As equals.\" Choukichi looked at him curiously.\n\n\"Why?\" He asked. The shogun sighed and removed his helmet, placing it under his arm.\n\n\"Because you are going to die.\" Choukichi nodded. \n\n\"I am aware of that. All *too* aware, in fact.\" The shogun looked over at the castle in the distance.\n\n\"They have left the Shogunate. In two days, we begin our attack.\" \n\n\"Of course. And in two days, we shall win the war.\" Choukichi finished. Eito nodded despondently,\n\n\"And you shall die.\" Choukichi nodded.\n\n\"I will.\" He agreed, \"But it is a samurai's privilege to die in service of his master.\"\n\n\"Well said.\" The man sighed, \"But do you not care for your own life?\"\n\n\"What living creature does not care if it lives or dies?\" Choukichi continued, looking away at the castle, \"But that is what set humans apart. I do not welcome death, but if die I must, die I shall.\" Eito stared at the man. \n\n\"You are a better man than I.\" He said, replacing his helmet, and clambering back up onto his horse. Choukichi turned to him,\n\n\"It is not the army that makes the general, Eito-dono. It is the general that makes the army.\" Eito nodded and rode back down the hill, leaving Choukichi to his thoughts.\n\n------------------\n\n\"And so now we are going to study the Golden Age of ancient #BADWORDS#an,\" Mr. Takagawa continued to lecture, \"Kawachi Eito, the first shogun of this 'Golden Age' is widely considered to be one of the greatest leaders in all of #BADWORDS#anese history.\" He looked around at his bored students, \"Anyone able to tell me what he is most famous for?\" One student raised his hand,\n\n\"He was known for taking the Kyoto Shogunate.\" Takagawa nodded,\n\n\"Correct. By sending his most-trusted general, Kiyomizu Choukichi, to draw away the main army from Kyoto, he was able to secure the Shogunate. Unfortunately, Choukichi's army was caught between Kishiwada castle and the approaching Shogunate forces. It was a slaughter. Yet, in every recollection of this battle, both military and civilian, the last man standing was Choukichi himself, fighting til his last breath.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409609726","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ck6k86n","link_id":"t3_2f6f18","name":"t1_ck6k86n","parent_id":"t3_2f6f18","retrieved_on":1427250616,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":true,"author":"DCBW1144","body":"Have you ever had that bad dream where everything seems utterly... *wrong*? Everything seems completely normal but there's something *off* about it. Rooms are too big or too small, people say things and act in bizarre and uncanny ways. Nothing scary even has to happen, it's just the alien familiarity that terrifies you into wakefulness.\n\nI managed to create that and put it on a tape, way back when. Must have been...nineteen eighty something. Some boys from NATO came to me one day and told me they wanted me to create something based on some new scientific discoveries. I thought they were having me on. I'd heard [a Kate Bush song](http://youtu.be/NTUcoR8_pyE) that made reference to the same thing. A Situationist prank by the record company I figured.\n\nNo. They were the real deal. And I was the top music producer around. I could turn any recording into a work of pure beauty just by manipulating tapes and distortion. I'd produced a fair few records I'd loved and a fair few records I'd hated, and a few I didn't care either way about. But this - this was big. The NATO boys, in their suits, promised me a large cash sum and promised this would never be traced back to me. I won't disclose how much they gave me. But in those days, it was a lot.\n\nThe scientific research they gave me suggested that the brain, when exposed to certain sensory stresses, would \"short out\" and the entire cerebral cortex would die, leaving only an immobilised vegetable. The type of stresses required would need to be a sound so utterly *wrong* that the brain was simply unable to process it. A sound that incited such utter terror the mind stopped functioning completely and permanently.\n\nI dug through tapes from journalist broadcasts. To get myself prepared for this work I listened to 911 recordings of women being shot by burglars, watched footage of gruesome car accidents, looked at pictures of gutted corpses from some civil war somewhere, #BADWORDS# if I know now. I'm desensitised to it all. Slowly, I started to worm out noises from the intense period of mental distress I was undergoing. I went to local mental hospitals and recorded [the screams of patients undergoing serious psychiatric treatment](http://youtu.be/br5tyuEUBWE). They said it would be the#BADWORDS#utic for them. I wasn't so sure.\n\nI spent hours working away on the tape, making sure to take regular rest breaks while putting it together. Every five minutes I'd go out, listen to whatever record I was loving at that time. I think about the time I was recording it, it was *Remain in Light* by Talking Heads. *Pet Sounds* by The Beach Boys was a particular favourite of mine as well. That album sounds like dread to me now. Dread of having to hear what I was putting together in that room again.\n\nOne day, I listened a little longer than usual and I suffered an intense nosebleed. I passed out. I woke up later in a military hospital with the NATO boys around me. \"You did well,\" they said, smiling crooked smiles. They promised the money would be in my account soon, and I never saw that tape again.\n\nDid they ever deploy the tape? I don't know. Have they ever played it to anyone? I don't know. But it's the 2010s now. The Berlin Wall has fallen. I figured they never needed to deploy it because no major exchanges took place. But there's just one thing that's been playing on my mind since the Eighties, even since the Berlin Wall fell. \n\nI worry simply about one thing.\n\nThe day I switch on the radio, and my recording is playing.\n\nThe day they drop the psychic bomb.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409651488","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ck6ysca","link_id":"t3_2f8rne","name":"t1_ck6ysca","parent_id":"t3_2f8rne","retrieved_on":1427243736,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

I should have paid more attention in Math class.\n\n“Your punishment is…” he said, unfolding a piece of paper.  He read it aloud, “Spin the wheel!” His smile was as wide as his face.  The audience roared.\n\nI took a deep breath, approaching the wheel.  It was sitting on an enormous platform, like an oversized roulette table.  But this wasn’t roulette.  There was a lot more than money at stake.\n\nThe wheel was heavier than I’d expected.  It was painted like a pie chart, sliced into a hundred pieces.  Each slice bore the name of a planet.  And one slice had a skull on it with the letters ‘XXX’.  The slice directly opposite had a picture of a beautiful beach resort.  I swung the wheel around.  My heart pounded in my chest.\n\nclick-click-click.  The wheel whirred past.  Pictures of planets of all kinds blurred with motion.  Desert planets, water planets, advanced civilizations, cave-dwelling societies, planets ruled by dinosaurs.\n\n“As you know,” The gameshow host said, “Whichever planet the wheel lands on will be your home for one week.  If you survive, we’ll bring you back on the show next week for another chance at the grand prize!”\n\nThe audience clapped.\n\n“Or,” he said, “You can decide to go home.  Empty-handed.  Forever giving up your chance at the prize money.”\n\nThe audience booed.\n\nThe wheel slowed.  It turned passed the XXX-skull planet.  It turned passed the beach resort.  It stopped a few planets later... on a planet that I’d never heard of.\n\n“What’s your decision?” the host asked.  “Spend a week on that planet, or give up and go home?”\n\nI cleared my throat.  “I’d like to use a lifeline, please,” I said.\n\n“Which lifeline?” the host asked.\n\n“Phone-a-friend.” I said.\n\n“Very well.”  He handed me a phone.\n\nI dialed Yoda.\n\n“Greetings Padawan,” Yoda said, “Where are you?”\n\n“Hi Yoda,” I said, “Listen, I need some help.

Okay, so that's technically breaking the rules of the prompt, but I like this section anyway.))\n\nSerik Ansible Networks Recording 12542ba726a\n\n\"Miss Tadis. We weren't expecting to hear from you this soon. How goes the hunt?\"\n\n\"You set me up, Vexal\"\n\n\"Beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Damn right, you 'beg my pardon.' At what point were you planning on telling me about the daughter?\"\n\n\"You were told that you would be capturing two fugitives: Captain Antero Beaky, and his daughter, Kaya. I don't see the problem.\"\n\n\"You're kidding, right? You didn't think it would be important to mention that the nine-year-old girl is combat trained? By your organization? She practically killed both Yale and myself in five seconds flat. Is this the part where you tell me that you set me up against your pint-sized ninja to test my skills?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I simply wasn't given permission to disclose the details of Kaya's abilities. You can understand that her program is top secret.\"\n\n\"So I almost died because you-\"\n\n\"You almost died because you got careless. Never underestimate an opponent. Christ, Miss Tadis, you just spent a month capturing a two-foot tall fuzzball of a serial killer. You should know by now never to judge by appearance.\"\n\n\"That was different. I was told ahead of time that the Kerrik was dangerous. Kaya is literally a goddamn assassin, and I didn't find out until she had knocked out Yale and was coming at me with a knife.\"\n\n\"Look, assigning blame now is pointless. Did you capture them?\"\n\n[pause]\n\n\"Well, did you?\"\n\n\"We had to... fall back.\"\n\n\"Miss Tadis, I know that voice. That's your plotting voice.\"\n\n\"No it's not!\"\n\n\"And that's your 'hand-in-the-cookie-jar\" voice. Miss Tadis - Kiri - are you lying to me?\"\n\n\"What? What would I have to lie about?\"\n\n\"People have many reasons for lying. Usually when they don't want somebody else to know something.\"\n\n\"You don't say.\"\n\n\"Something like whether or not they were able to capture the fugitives they were hunting.\"\n\n\"And why would I... Why would someone need to lie about that?\"\n\n\"You must understand that Antero and his daughter are powerful beyond their combat abilities. We trained Kaya to psychoanalyze as well. It's very possible that she is trying to manipulate you. She might claim that she was not a volunteer. I assure you, both the father and the daughter signed the necessary paperwork. She might try... exaggerating... the work we've done - which, by the way, is unfinished, and could be very dangerous to Kaya if left that way. All I'm saying is that nobody would blame you if you were tricked by the fugitives.\"\n\n\"Are you implying something? If you've got an accusation, you best get it the hell out in the open. I haven't got a brain for subtlety.\"\n\n\"Now that was a lie, Miss Tadis. All I'm saying is that Kaya has strengths you might not see coming, and she may try to turn you against us. If you can't capture Antero and Kaya Beaky, we'll send a different Hunter. One who will do whatever it takes to secure the prisoners, regardless of who is in the way.\"\n\n[long pause]\n\n\"If I didn't know any better, Vexal, I'd say that sounds an awful lot like a thinly veiled threat.\"\n\n\"How fortunate that you know better. Now, are we done here?\"\n\n\"Find the dad. Find the girl. Don't listen to a word they say. Bring them back to the lab on Menta. I understand.\"\n\n\"Excellent. We have nothing further to discuss. Make good decisions out there, Kiri.\"\n\n[Comm link terminated]\n\n\"So. Our Hunter has been swayed by the infallible rhetoric of a nine-year-old girl.\"\n\n\"It would appear so. Damn, I knew we shouldn't have send in Kiri.\"\n\n\"Miss Tadis is our best hunter.\"\n\n\"She's too sentimental. To quick to believe the lies of a cornered girl.\"\n\n\"Well, they're not exactly lies, Vexal.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. Anyway, it doesn't matter. What's our next course of action?\"\n\n\"We wait. If Kiri comes to us, prisoners in hand, then we will proceed as planned. If she fails to make an appearance, well... We'll just have to find a way to convince her.\"\n\n\"I know a few people who are good at convincing.\" ","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409702491","downs":0,"edited":"1409703886","gilded":0,"id":"ck7k14k","link_id":"t3_2fa3jh","name":"t1_ck7k14k","parent_id":"t3_2fa3jh","retrieved_on":1427230058,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":true,"author":"Travastic24","body":"PART 2:\n\nThree days had past. The “your side and my side” philosophy worked out pretty good until I had stripped my trees bare of coconuts. His trees were still loaded, he was not eating. I did not want to cross onto his side, so I went to sleep that night hungry. In the morning there was a pile of coconuts next to me. I looked over at his side; he was asleep under one of the trees. Something was wrong with the picture I was seeing. He was shirtless, and his chest was what was wrong. It was covered in red bumps. I tried to ignore them, but finally my curiosity got the better of me. I crept up as close as I could without going onto his side. Like I had seen there really where red bumps all over his torso, they where pretty big, and some had purple rings around them. He moved, I quickly hid behind the tree, he jolted up in pain, one of the bumps was bleeding on his back, he had scratched against the tree he was leaning on. He could feel the blood trickle down his back, but he could not reach the bump it was coming from. The blood was spurting now, so I couldn’t help myself.\n“Let me.” I said, ripping off one of my shirtsleeves. “What are all these bumps?” I asked.\n“I think I’m allergic to something.” \n“Like what? Not coconut?” \n“No,” he winced as a touched his back with my torn sleeve, “I eat a lot of coconut back home.”\n“Maybe something in the water.” I said. He winced again.\n“Oh, wait, I know what it is.” He said. A look of pain swept his face.\n“What?”\n“I must be allergic to you.” he said starting to laugh.\nI wanted to whack him. But the bumps all over him stopped me. He kept on laughing, but stopped short, another bump was bleeding, and he winced in pain again. \n“I don’t get you.” I said. \n“Don’t get what?” he asked.\n“You, you’re so weird. I mean, do you or don’t you?”\n“Do I or don’t I wha—“ the “what” turned to a yell, I had pushed to hard on his back.\n“Hate me?” I said. He looked at me quizzically. \n“Do I hate you?” he asked. Now I really wanted to hit him. I didn’t though, a spurt of blood splashed my face, a bump on his shoulder had burst. He smiled and took the torn sleeve from my hand. He wiped the blood off my face.\n“I don’t hate you. Okay?” he said. \n“Okay then, why were you so upset when you found out you had saved me?” I asked. He said nothing for a few minutes. Finally, I spoke up.\n“You can tell me the truth, it wont kill me.” I said.\n“You want the truth?” he asked.\n“Yes.”\n“I have a thing against actresses.” \n“Actresses?”\n“Yes, you know, girls who think they are just all that and more.”\n“Girls like me?” I said.\n“Yup. Like you.” \n“Why?” I asked. It took him a minute, but finally the answer came out.\n“I fell in love with an actress, and she turned out to be married.” He said simplistically. \n“Which one?” I asked. He didn’t answer. He just tried to stand up. But by now his entire back was covered in blood. \n“We have to do something about your back.” \n“Coconut milk.” He said. Licking his teeth in a thoughtful way.\n“What about coconut milk?” I asked.\n“I can rinse off in it, if we have enough.” \n“Yes, but then we’ll have nothing to drink, and we’ll die of thirst.”\n“You’re right.”\n“Okay then, can you make a fire?” I asked.\n“What good is fire?”\n“I can heat a stick till it’s really hot, and sterilize these bumps or boils, or whatever they are.”\nHe looked surprised.\n“Good idea.”\n\nWhen it was dark, we had a steady fire blazing.  I had finished sterilizing the boils on his back and chest; he was now roasting a chunk of coconut.\n“Does it taste better roasted?” I questioned.\n“To me it does. Want to try some?”\n“Sure.” I crawled over to him. He touched the hot coconut and his fingers made a sizzling sound.  He put them in his mouth. \n“Ow.” He said. It sounded #BADWORDS#led with his fingers in his mouth.\nI couldn’t help but laugh. However, I regained my composure and took his hand in mine. I blew softly on his fingers. He pulled his hand out of mine and looked away. I don’t get it! One minute he likes me, the next minute he pulls away!  What was with this guy? \nHe waited till the coconut had cooled slightly, then gave me a piece. \n“Wow, this is good.”\n“Told you.” he replied. There he was again, now he liked me. What was he? Bi-polar? Great, I’m stuck on an island with a bi-polar actress hater.\n“Which actress was it that you fell in love with? Had you ever met her?”\nI asked him again.\n“Yes, we met. But she wouldn’t remember me.”\n“How did you meet?\" \n“At an after party for the opening of one of her films. I was there because I knew one of the costars and he invited me. I met her, and she and I hit it off really well. We talked for hours, and even after the party was over, we stayed late—just talking. It was two days later when I saw in the news that she was married.”\n“I can see why you say she wouldn’t remember you, I forget everything from after parties. I can’t remember any of them, much less a certain one. However, I have been accused of having a bad memory.” I said. For some reason, this struck him as hilarious, he laughed. \n“What’s so funny?” I asked.\n“You are.” He said.\n“What do you mean?” I demanded. He didn’t answer. I distracted myself from this complicating-stumbling-block-in-the-progress-of-man sitting next to me by checking his bumps.\n“They seem to be going down.” I touched them lightly.\n“I can feel that.” He stammered, looking at the sky. \n“Sorry. It probably hurts.”\nHe said nothing, once again, he was hiding. \n“Listen, just because one stupid actress hurts you—“ I broke off into a scream. He looked and saw what I did, the spider, or one like it, was nibbling at my leg!\nHe pulled it off, and threw it out into the water. \n“I thought you said it wouldn’t bite!”\n“I guess you where to tasty to resist.” He smiled. I sneered playfully and went a few feet into the water, it was lovely and cool, he followed me out. In the faint light from the fire I looked down at my leg, I was getting a bump where the spider had bit me, just like the bumps on his torso. \n“That explains it.” I said showing him my leg. He inspected it. It was then that I felt the exact opposite of what I had been feeling before. Instead of the thought of whacking him, I stepped closer to him, took hold of his chin, and kissed him. He pulled back so fast you would have thought I was a viper!\n“What?!” I shouted.\n“You’re married!” he yelled, wiping his lips.\n\nSuddenly all became clear.\n\nMy weak memory had been jumped like a weak car engine. The sparks of recognition flew in all directions, and my jaw, literally, dropped.\n\nSuddenly a bright light shined on both of us, a loud horn was heard, and we both looked towards the light. It was the ship, huge and gloomy, floating a little ways off shore. A dingy was being lowered into the water.\n\nTen minutes later, I was in my cabin with my agent. My companion was sent to the first aid room. My agent was personally seeing to my bump.\n“I can’t believe you just fell over board!” she said.\n“Neither can I.” I said distantly. Only one thing was on my mind. Why did he think I was married? What was that all about?\n“Was I ever married?” I asked.\n“Married? No, well—in a publicity stunt yes, but the whole thing blew over real fast.” My agent replied. I jumped up and ran out, I picked my direction and flew down the passage yelling at the top of my lungs, “It was a publicity stunt! It was a publicity stunt!” I landed and came down to earth in the first aid room. He was sitting on the table; the nurse was covering the bumps with gauze. He looked up.\n“It,” I panted, “was all a fake!” \n“What was?” he asked.\n“The marriage, the whole thing! I had completely forgotten about it!” \nHearing this must have done something to him. He was changed from an actress hating, reclusive, bi-polar--to a Casanova. He got off the table, walked confidently over, looked deep into my eyes and said:\n“Are you kidding me?” he rolled his eyes.\nBut that was all he said, that was all he could say. His lips were sealed with mine.  \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409715359","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ck7pybt","link_id":"t3_2fb35i","name":"t1_ck7pybt","parent_id":"t3_2fb35i","retrieved_on":1427225553,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

They were obviously here for a loan. They showed all the signs. The man on the left had an uneasy smile as he tried to sympathize. “It-It’s not that bad! You get to share wealth.” His company had laughed along, trying to make an awkward situation better but just making it more uneasy. “So you’re here for money, right? Gonna start a business or some #BADWORDS#?” He nonchalantly questioned. The two men nodded, looking around to see the very professional office not fitting for this… joker. Kyle lifted his legs and leaned backwards, placing his feet up onto his workspace. “So you’re gonna get the money, however much you want. As long as you pay the bank back I don’t give a #BADWORDS#. But just so you know, the bank has a serious method of dealing with debt. Some people have gotten their lives ruined over two grand.” The men cheered together before talking between each other. Kyle wrote some things into a form and handed them the papers. He didn’t care; he was more worried about the person who had been trying to kill him for the past three weeks; ever since he got this job, actually. The two men held their hands out, the greedy #BADWORDS#. Kyle places the paper into one of their hands and waved his. “Get out.” They happily obliged, cheering over the paper that held their fortune. His eyes closed and he breathed quietly for a few seconds. And he dozed off.\n \nKyle’s phone rang and he came to, quickly landing his feet on the ground; and answering the phone. “Hello? Who is this?” Completely disregarding the standard introduction he was meant to recite when answering his calls. There was heavy breathing on the other end, “IRS. 165 Hallager Lane.” Kyle quickly slammed the phone onto the desk, and then lifted it, and did it again. He did that until the phone smashed into pieces. “I am done.” He stood up, and pushed through one of the office workers that opened his door to find out what the banging was. He understood what the voice wanted; the voice had explained and explained what he had to do. And he was going to do it, because he was going insane. The voice had to be trying to kill him. To #BADWORDS# pester him to death, he couldn’t focus on anything. The letters and numbers chanted through his head all through the day. “I..R..S.. 165… Hallager… Lane…” Repeated in his head for days at a time. He got into his car and drove off, typing the address into his GPS.  He turned onto the street, finding the small #BADWORDS#alow style house covered by the shade of a large oak tree in the front yard. Kyle opened the door, popped open his truck and took out a baseball bat. The slamming of the trunk echoed through the street, and a car drove past him quickly down the street. As he approached the door some movement in the house caught his eye. He saw a small kitten sitting against the windowsill on the inside. Kyle knocked quietly. A small timid old woman pulled open the door, smiling sweetly. “Yes, Dear?” Kyle swung hard, and the woman went down. He kept swinging until she wasn’t a body anymore. A phone rang. Kyle ran to it, it had to be the voice. It had to be done with him. “Welcome to the IRS.”\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409727402","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ck7txpj","link_id":"t3_2fc2yu","name":"t1_ck7txpj","parent_id":"t3_2fc2yu","retrieved_on":1427222841,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"Salchonic","body":"Norman woke up instantly and completely, feeling exceedingly refreshed, if a little bit stiff. He took his time to stretch and roll around in bed, enjoying the few glorious moments of warm comfort afforded to him before he would have to get up and head to school. When his bed no longer had any additional comfort to provide, he conceded to slinging his feet out of bed and sitting up, then rubbed his eyes a final time and exited his room.\n\nThe stairs seemed longer than usual today, but Norman was used to that by now. He ran his hand along the wall as he wandered down a series of halls, leaving a long purple trail in his wake to find his way back, should he ever need to head back upstairs. Before long he found himself in the kitchen, and plopped himself down into a soft recliner set by the small kitchen table.\n\n\"Morning Mom,\" Norman grumbled. \"How's work?\"\n\nNorman's mother finished smashing the wrinkles out of an egg before serving it to him,  presenting it as a perfect, smooth circle on a plate. \"Well, I've been pulling overtime because Nancy's on leave, but you know how hard things are for them already.\"\n\nNorman let out a long, hearty laugh. \"Oh, yes. I remember vividly. Nancy is your friend who keeps having to call out the plumber for her sprinklers, right?\"\n\n\"No dearie, that's Rachel. Nancy is spending the year dead for tax purposes.\" Norman's mom turned back to the bowl of pancake mix she'd frozen the night before and began to stir it with two fingers. \"A year dead seems like a perfectly acceptable amount of time off, don't you think?\"\n\nNorman grunted in the affirmative through his mouth full of oatmeal. \"Mmm! Sorry mom, got to get going. I'm going to miss the bus and I have that large presentation today!\" He scrambled to his feet, and immediately dropped dozens of small, immensely important parts of the presentation he was putting on. He fumbled around for a moment, grabbing the majority, before racing out the front door.\n\nWithin ten minutes Norman was on the bus with his usual group of friends, chatting amiably about the patterns that were hidden in prime numbers. His friend John, who was wearing Raquel's hair at the time, tapped on his shoulder. \"Hey Norm, ain't that your mom outside?\"\n\nNorman looked out of the bus window at the freeway, where his mom was speeding along at a respectable 95 to keep pace with the bus while leaning out the driver's side window with a pair of jeans in hand.\n\n\"Nooorrrrman!\" she called over the roaring wind. \"You forgot these!\"\n\nNorman looked down to see he was wearing nothing but his tighty-whiteys, and was instantly filled with dread.

Sure it turned all of neuroscience on it's ear, but it worked, every time. But Dr. Kindshauer sat there awed at the prospect of a cure. He rose to his feet and walked closer to the screen, as if the data might change if he changed his perspective. \"But the losses, are they permanent,\" He asked, fully realizing the answer to the come.\n\n\"Selective Neurological Triage Therapy causes—,\" One of the researchers started.\n\n\"Is the memory loss permanent,\" he adamantly interrupted.\n\nThe lead researcher, Dr. Woods, understood the question and sheepishly replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nFor a moment the air seemed thick with tension. The certainty of a cure for Alzheimer's was all at once as gratifying as it was abhorrent. The conference room at the CDC was deathly quiet. The holy grail of neuroscience was within the grasp of doctors and scientists everywhere, but the victory was the most pyrrhic of all. Complete loss of affected memory. There was no therapy, there was no recovery, just a portion of the brain so lost it was as if it never existed.\n\nKindshauer walked slowly walked back to his seat at the head of the conference table and slumped into his seat, the implications of the discovery weighing down his normally larger than life presence. He thought of all the review his teams had done. It was safe, effective, and repeatable. It had all the hallmarks of a miracle cure. One simple injection of a synthesized protein into the base of the skull could halt all progress of the disease within the week. \n\n\"How soon can the treatment be mass produced,\" Kindshauer slowly asked, realizing the implicit approval in the words.\n\n\"Given the FDAs involvement along all stages due to the testing requirements, we could have approval in two months and be at full scale production in six,\" a pharmaceutical executive replied, nearly wringing his hands at the prospect of the profits to be had.\n\nKindshauer knew the facts were too conclusive, and the costs to great not to move forward.  He spoke his next words slowly. \"You have my approval.\" His thoughts briefly flashed to his wife at home; her being unable to remember him or their two daughters on her worst days. \"You have my complete approval.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409814367","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ck8rmfm","link_id":"t3_2fcl09","name":"t1_ck8rmfm","parent_id":"t3_2fcl09","retrieved_on":1427204073,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"SirRebelBeerThong","body":"Stevenson was executing his escape and evasion plan.  He needed to reach the nearest Kurdish controlled zone, but first he needed to evade or kill this son of a #BADWORDS#.  His enemy was on a #BADWORDS# motorcycle scouting for survivors of the ambush that occurred hours ago.  He had no idea where the rest of his squad was, his radio was damaged and for all he knew, they were all dead.  In this kind of scenario, it becomes every man for himself.  \n\nStevenson doubled back on his trail.  He positioned himself on the low crest of a small hill dotted with scrub.  Fortunately it was dark and the batteries in his night optics had not died yet.  He was in a perfect position to observe the approaching #BADWORDS#.  Stevenson had scant ammunition and did not want the crack of the rounds to betray his position.  This encounter needed to be silent and it needed to be deadly. \n\nStevenson's quarry was approaching on a small yellow and white motorcycle.  Since Stevenson had made his trail obvious, the man had no problem following and was playing the part nicely.  The man on the motorcycle slowed to inspect the glove Stevenson had dropped earlier.  The man bent down and Stevenson leapt from his cover and tackled the man off the motorcycle.\n\nThe man responded quicker than expected with an elbow to Stevenson's left kidney.  Stevenson grunted and pulled the man into a guard position.  Stevenson outweighed the man by at least 30 pounds.  Stevenson was almost in control when the man began to dig his thumbs into Stevenson's eyes.  He hacked his forearms down onto the man's wrists and retained one of the wrists.  \n\nBoth men now had an arm free, but Stevenson was quicker; reaching for his combat knife he found his Glock instead.  Stevenson fiercely pistol whipped the man across the temple and the man reeled.  Stevenson rolled over, straddled the man and began to beat his face with a closed fist over the pistol grip.  The soft parts of the man's face quickly turned to pulp as the man sputtered.  Teeth fell from his mouth along with pink bubbly ooze dribbling down his neck into the sand.  In his blood lust, Stevenson did not notice the man was already unconscious.  Stevenson, kneeling, raised his upper body and slammed his elbow into the man's trachea, crushing it.  Panting, Stevenson watched the man struggling to breath.  The man's foot gave a final twitch. \n\n\n**You're right, writing a fight scene is difficult!**\nEDIT: a word","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409855473","downs":0,"edited":"1409856050","gilded":0,"id":"ck95dh9","link_id":"t3_2fgw8c","name":"t1_ck95dh9","parent_id":"t3_2fgw8c","retrieved_on":1427197409,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":true,"author":"AirbornePorcine","body":"The crisp crackle of an early autumn morning. The smell of freshly baked goods from the store down the street. The feel of her lips upon his own. These were all things that he was unlikely to experience again.\n\nBut it was fine.\n\nThe landscape before him shifted, endless black to sparkling blue, tumbling, twisting, but not violently; no, slowly, steadily. The moment he had slipped off the gangway — an amateur mistake — his body had relaxed into the motion of it, arms going slack, eyes half-lidded. At times, the light from the blazing sun suggested the form of the ship he’d slipped from: an irregularly shaped speck in the distance, floating so close to the intersection of planet and space that it was nearly invisible. That lack of immediacy, the insurmountable distance between them, soothed him.\n\nHe inhaled languidly, then thumbed his suit #BADWORDS#ers one last time: no response, other than a fine mist of particulate that fogged the outside glass of his mask. A smile grew over his face, warm and slow. Drawing hearts in the dew on the windows, *J.D. + F.K.*  scribbled within, with hopes that their forever would be real. Scraping gleaming hoarfrost from her car on a bright winter day. Driving, just *driving*, no destination in mind, simply being with each other. He missed her, but he was right there with her.\n\nHis speed exceeded escape velocity for the small, ocean-bound planet, but he didn’t notice the warnings from his suit computer. His oxygen supply read twenty minutes — twenty, the number of decades they’d promised to be together, back when they were teenagers, too caught up in the drunk headiness of their love to realize the improbable length of time that entailed.\n\nHe was not coming back.\n\nBut it was fine.\n\nIt was fine.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409862089","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ck98yh7","link_id":"t3_2fgv88","name":"t1_ck98yh7","parent_id":"t3_2fgv88","retrieved_on":1427195647,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":true,"author":"holes754","body":"At first when I heard about it, I was afraid. I knew I just had to try it. It's all the rage. It's been dubbed as \"Better than LSD,\" \"More fun than anything you've ever had before,\" and so on. But I was going to be the judge of that. I called up my dealer, Todd. He said he just got some, was selling it at a pretty steep price. I cut a deal, and we were going to meet in an hour at the usual spot.\n\nI arrived, and Todd was about to light some up himself. He gave me a small bag of a light blue, almost teal, substance. I forgot my lighter at home, so I had to borrow Todd's. The two of us rolled this stuff like cigarettes, and started smoking. Immediately I was back in my childhood home. \n\nI had no idea how old I was, or what this was. I was sitting in my room, but it wasn't me. I felt as if I was a ghost, floating above myself, staring down, judging. Like that feeling you get when you think somebody's watching you. Except this time, you are actually watching. \n\nI heard a banging at the door, and my former self snapped straight to it, with a face of fear on his, or my, face. I watched as my father slammed open the door, belt in one hand, beer in the other. I watched as I backed into the corner of my room, near to my old closet. I remember the door being broken later in my life. Was this why?\n\nMy father grew closer and closer. And with each step, I shuddered. I was so afraid. But why? My father was never aggressive, as far as I remember. Hell, I don't even remember who my dad was. Which helped me to realize that I must have been at most 14 years old when this happened. Although my interpretation of time isn't my strongest point. \n\nMy father was right over me now. I wasn't sure what would come first, the empty bottle or the belt. I was crouched in the corner, bracing for what could be the worst pain a child could feel. With myself looking away, I couldn't see what it was that brought with it the most horrible pain I'd ever felt in my life. I watched myself slouch over.\n\nI opened my eyes to a crowd of spectators and a hospital crew. Todd had shook me awake. I looked around, gathered my surroundings, and tried to stand myself up. But why can't I move anymore? I'm staring straight at Todd, but I'm stuck. I stared at Todd, screaming for help. The EMTs had grabbed me, and put me in the ambulance while running so many tests on me. But couldn't they see I was awake? I'm right here, dammit! Why are you doing this? I'm OK!\n\nThey ignored me. I stopped screaming, I was wasting my time. I was just going to have to deal with this #BADWORDS#, and I could get on with my day. But then I saw my mother was there. Why was she here? I'm OK, and how did she even know where I was? How did they call her here so fast? I was only out for a few minutes. And now why is she crying? What is going on? Somebody, please, why?!\n\nAs the ambulance doors shut, I noticed that I wasn't in good shape. I had a mask over my face, tubes everywhere, and I felt like I was going to pass out. I reached for the phone. I needed to call Jackie. She needs to know I'm OK. But then I heard it again. The crying from the corner. Except this time, it wasn't my own. I caught a glimpse of my mother, Jackie, and Daisy in the corner of the room. But when did I get in this room? When did that phone I had just reached out for appear? And what happened to the ambulance doors?\n\nA doctor walked in. I knew I was in trouble, but I recognized this place now. It was a hospital. More specifically, it was the hospital room where I was. I watched as the doctor spoke softly. Why was he speaking so low? I watched his mouth move, and heard a faint whisper that I couldn't quite make out. Then I watched as the crying grew louder and more frantic. I began to cry. But why are there no tears?\n\nAround now it finally dawned on me. Am I dead? Why can't I use my own body? All I could do was sit there and watch, as my loved ones just watched me. A month passed. Then another. I noticed time passing faster and faster, and my senses growing less respondent. I wanted so desperately to wake up from this nightmare. I never asked for this. I never wanted any of this. I watched Jackie's visits become less and less frequent. If only she knew what kind of affect she had on me when she was around. Her visits where the highlights of my short periods of consciousness. \n\nI looked at the clock. The hands were spinning. Hours became seconds. Days went by in the blink of an eye. When suddenly, it all stopped. The clock slowed down to normal time, and I could move again. I sat myself up, and looked around. I was alone. But I wasn't in the hospital anymore. Now I was sitting back in my room. I looked at my side, and Jackie was there, sleeping. \n\nI got out of bed slowly. I didn't want to wake her. I walked into the kitchen, sat down, and started bawling. Why did it have to be that? I'd heard stories of people reliving their first vacation, their first time, the moment they were born even. Why did I have to get the coma? I looked at the table, and saw the picture of myself, my mother, and Jackie. It must have been after the coma. I had a large plump of hair missing on the right side of my head, just above my ear. If it had been just an inch lower, I'd be half deaf right now. Damn was I lucky. \n\nI started heading back to the bedroom, I had work in the morning and I needed all the sleep I could get. I don't even know why I decided to try this stuff, I stopped my drug habits when I was 20. But I was told that this was THE thing. I should never have trusted Todd. Not after last time. I crawled back into bed with Jackie, and checked the clock. 2 AM. At least I can get a few hours of sleep before work in the morning. I, no, we left it all behind for a reason. And after this experience, I was never going back. \n\n---------------------------\n\nVery much enjoyed this prompt. I haven't written like that in a long time, felt good.

{"archived":true,"author":"Novawulfen","body":"A few years ago, I was working on the giant heads on the Easter Islands.  Everyone knows about the heads, but it was only in 2012, wen we discovered the fact that the heads had bodies.  I spent a long time with my colleagues, digging down, carefully cataloging not just the dimensions of the bodies, but also the kinds of soil and other geological anomalies.  We discovered a series of symbols on the base of one of the statues, and I made a record of them.  For some reason, I was unable to translate it, even though I was pretty certain that I knew at least a few words and symbols of all of the known alphabets and languages in and around Polynesia.   The linguistics expert I sent them to, a woman by the name of Sandra Ellicott, took a two years to translate the text and was able to make what she called an \"educated guess\" as to what the text said.  It appeared to be a recording of a creation myth, but not the one that we knew from those islands.  She speculated that the story was one that the early Rapa Nui may have heard the story from an earlier group of settlers and decided to write it down.  Whatever the case, the story is presented here as a translation, though it must be assumed that inaccuracies exist, as we only have one sample of the language, and it can only be translated by reference to other scripts.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nLong ago, when the world was young and nothing had form yet, the whole of the world was a blank slate.  Flat and formless, it sat.  Motionless and lifeless it sat. A perfect sphere in the night sky, full of possibility, but with not a mark on it.  And so it was when Mata-Ai came upon it.  He saw the perfection of the world, and he marveled at its simplicity.  He wondered at its creation.  It seemed impossible to him that such a thing with simple form could exist.  He asked himself what being could have crafted this wonder, and for what purpose?\n\n\nAnd he wished to see for himself what it was made of, and what its function was.  And this he decided to walk upon it, and see what this world felt like under his feet.  He saw that the surface was smooth and wished to know more of it.  Thus did Mata-Ai put his feet upon the world.\n\n\nFor a time he walked.  The ground was hard, but yielding.  Mata-Ai called the land he walked upon \"the sands\" and felt the white grit between his toes.  He walked for many miles, and looked only ahead. ^1  The land stretched before him, pure and white and clean and for many days and nights he walked, seeing only the blank world before him.  He began to doubt his sense of time and place in the featureless landscape.  \n\nAfter a time, he saw a blemish on the world.  The white sand appeared to change to yellow in the distance.  He ran t it and fell to his knees to see it closer.  The purity^2 of the world had been tarnished and Mata-Ai raged .  He smote the ground with his fist and swore to find the one that had broken the world and made it tarnished.  He raised himself to his feet and strode forth with purpose.  And as he walked he saw more impurities.  There were areas where the sands had been churned, and tossed.  Areas where the ground was bowed and packed tightly all the while it seemed as though another had preceded him.  Mata-Ai cursed this unseen demon.  His hands were sore from smiting the earth and this fueled his rage as he shook his fist.  \n\n\nHe followed the trail of tainted lands, naming each impurity as he saw it.  First there were the hills, and then valleys.  The shell of this perfect egg^3 had been broken, and he named each fault that he might punish the desacrator.  His rage grew and as he reached the height of his wrath, he saw a point where the tracks took to a run and he pursued.  It was only when he saw that the tracks led to an imprint of his own knees, where he had fallen to them before, that he stopped and saw.  \n\n\nHe realized that he was the one that had tarnished the world, and taken away the form and the purity.  His feet and his blood and his sweat had changed the world, and the sphere could no longer be.  He sank once more to his knees and wept for what he had done.  He wept great tears and when he stopped he saw that his tears had filled the gaps and the cracks in the world, and he called them the oceans.  And then he looked for his blood,for he knew his hands had bled where he had struck the earth, but he did not see it.\n\n\nHe searched and searched until he saw other tracks.  They were smaller and did not tarnish the land.  He saw people and knew that his blood and tears had brought life to the sand and made others in his image.  They lived upon an island that would require only one day of walking to cross, and he marveled that such beings could be, created of the sand and of his blood and his sweat.  And so he spoke to them and they feared him.  Mata-Ai was dismayed at their fear and spoke with words of kindness.  He spoke of how he had created the world, and how he would care for the people.  But the people shunned him and were afraid.  \"What manner of being\" they asked \"could have such power and why would he torment us?\"^4\n\nMata-Ai became sad.  He could not understand why those that were created in his image would come to despise and fear him so.  He left the world and his creations and returned to the stars to travel on.  He never returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n*1 - The translation here of \"looked only ahead\" is suspect, and the term in Polynesian could also suggest alternate possible translations of \"Never looked back\" and \"had no regrets\".  This translation was chosen as it fits the flow of the story best.*\n\n*2 - Possible alternate translation here as \"order\" or \"pattern\".*\n\n*3 - This word seemed odd, but apparently it doesn't fit any other translations.*\n\n*4 - This is probably incorrect, but the symbols used in the original text do not exactly match anything in Polynesian.*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1409968737","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckag34i","link_id":"t3_2fjbb4","name":"t1_ckag34i","parent_id":"t3_2fjbb4","retrieved_on":1427174352,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

Its doors ajar, crookedly towering fifty man-lengths.\n\nTell'Ivad su#BADWORDS#iously eyed the once resplendent entrance as his tattered squad finished the survivors of the Emperor's fifth assault with mercy. *A short blade to the throat.*\n\nAssuredly more compassion than what the Emperor's irregulars would have granted them. Rumors from the ramparts had been that the remnants of the failed sortie not but one sun ago hung impaled, languishing on long pikes lining the avenues of the burning gardens that circled the now blackened and pocked walls of Berth.\n\nCorporal Sticker wiped his blade clean off the lapel of a fallen arbalist and nodded to his sergeant, signaling to Tell\"Ivad that he had found something worth seeing.\n\nThe soldier's corpse bore the insignia of the Skulls, the Emperor's premier shock troops. The rest of the squad, some eight that remained from the original thirty three, knew by how Tell'Ivad's face hung, what was to come next.\n\n\"Mages.\" Tell'Ivad muttered. His head whipped to the Corporal, frantically barking orders. \"Sticker, take the northwest corner of the intersection. Bring Totts, Garland, and Geth. Get to the top floor and I need you to rain hell on these #BADWORDS#s as soon as they hit the square. Spire, Pike and Sprinter- you're with me. We take the north east. How are we on munitions?\"\n\nGrinning, his sapper drawled, \"Enough to light up the square, Sarge\" whilst patting his pack. Geth had been waiting for the order to bring out explosives since the battle started two suns ago. \n\nThe sergeant narrowed on Pike, whose blood crusted mug revealed that he too had pillaged extra bombs from the armory.\n\"They'll be walking through hell's door before they even know what hit them, sir\"\n\nTell'ivads gaze softened \"You're all damned thieves. And I love everyone one of you motherless mutts. Now, let's show these wizards how the 7th deals with unwelcome guests.\"\n\nThe squad broke, scurrying over rubble and countless corpses, darting to their positions. The oppressive weight of sorcery hung in the air, crackling around them, pebbles lifting slightly in the air as though weightless. \n\n*They are coming.*\n\nFrom their new positions, the defenders witnessed what was left of the north gate implode, stirring up ashes into the air, the sound thundering in the their chests. Shadows marched through the shattered entrance. Five score Imperial Skulls guarding three black robed Mages on high armored warhorses marched confidently toward the square, weapons readied. Knowing most of the defenders were crushed, they hastened through the square towards Berth's senate tower, stopping short upon hearing the shrill Berthren warcry of Tell'Ivad.\n\nEight heavy, explosive laden quarrels shot downward from the squad's position into the mass of imperials. Their screams quickly cut off by a massive detonation, flaying flesh from bone, shattering skulls, and flinging decimated bodies against stone. \n\nPeering through the red mist and raining human parts, Tell'Ivad spied among the imperials' remains one wizard, suspended in protective magic, stunned at the very center of the blackened crater.\n\nKnowing the opportunity limited, Tell'Ivad burst from the window, dropping through the awning below. His muscles screamed, as they were nearly spent from two suns of fighting without rest. With his squad following his lead, they closed on the wizard who was now regaining consciousness. He saw Sticker and the rest of the squad filing out from across the square, sprinting towards the mage, tripping over burning bones, weapons drawn.\n\n\nPike was the first to go down. \n\n\nThe mage wheeled, spinning as he lashed out a thin weave of cold blue sorcery, narrowly missing Tell'Ivad, but striking the soldiers neck behind him like an invisible blade. Pike's body still in full sprint thudded sickeningly to the ground sliding along rubble below, his explosive laden bag remarkably not detonating.\n\nStill spinning, the imperial unleashed a wave of concussive energy at Sticker's group, knocking them off their feet and flinging them like helpless dolls.\n\nTell'Ivad was within arms length of the mage, mid swing. Ducking the blow, the wizard abruptly drove his palm into the sergeant's nose. Streaming blood, he hit the cobbles sliding nearly 30 paces, gasping for air from the impact.\n\nSpire exploded into a meaty mist shortly before reaching the imperial mage, leaving Sprinter to bear the imperial's wrath alone.\nParrying the short bursts of thin sorcery, Sprinter lunged for a killing blow, but was met with a swift kick that launched him upward, landing with a bone chilling crack.\n\nThe prone sergeant, still dazed from the impact found himself beside the body of Pike, his bag but an arms length away.\n\nThe mage casually strode to Tell'Ivad, picking up a discarded blade on the way. Grinning as he watched more Imperial Skulls spill from the north gate, he readied the blade to take the sergeant's head.\n\nWeaponless, blood streaming from his nose, Tell'Ivad looked up at the imperial and grated, \"On behalf of the 7th... Welcome to Berth.\"\n\nSticker and Geth had just regained consciousness as they witnessed Tell'Ivad #BADWORDS# his gauntleted fist down upon Pike's explosive packed bag, taking the the wizard and himself in a jarring eruption of fire.\n\nThe grief stricken corporal turned to Geth.\n\n\"Tell the commander,\" he paused lifting himself from the ground, turning to face the newly arrived Skull infantry \"They have beached the walls and will be upon him in moments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410041861","downs":0,"edited":"1410106161","gilded":0,"id":"ckb36mv","link_id":"t3_2fn94g","name":"t1_ckb36mv","parent_id":"t3_2fn94g","retrieved_on":1427162196,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Just enough to make the pain stop and the thoughts go away. It's codeine, not heroin. I didn't want to die, but here I was, lying on the floor of my apartment on a desolate Tuesday night. My husband was off on business again. I knew that's all they were, business trips. Nothing scandalous. Nothing like I was trying to do. \n\nMy would-have-been lover broke up with me tonight, via a text message of all things. I knew from the very start it was wrong to feel for him what I did, especially when my husband had always been so supportive of me, of my depression and manic episodes and irrational behavior. I really did love my husband. He would give me the moon if he could. But he couldn't. And that's why I also loved another. I couldn't help it. \n\nHe had asked me to come and elope with him for the 50th time in a week. I had told him no, we have to wait. What we were waiting for I don't know. I couldn't ever bring myself to make a decision. Whether I chose to stay with my husband or leave with my lover, I would break someone's heart. And also my own. It sucks loving two people at once. He had texted me at 11:13 AM to say he was done waiting. It was over. I had sunk to my knees and howled like an animal. I had reached for a knife and lacerated my thighs. I had reached for the pills. And now here I am, almost dead.\n\nAs I stared into the ceiling light, glaring, blurring, shifting, I noticed someone in the corner of my vision. *Wonderful, the hallucinations are starting*, I thought. *I really am going to die alone in this damned apartment.* Alone among all the furniture and clothes my husband bought for me over the years. He would come home and find his beloved wife dead. He'd probably never get over it, the poor sod. He didn't deserve this. \n\nThe figure moved closer. She looked to be in her fifties. She had matted, dirty, thinning hair about 3 inches long, cropped shorter in some places. Her face was covered in scabs, and her limbs misshapen with the remnants of hundreds of deep gashes, those marks with which I could empathize too well. She walked with her feet turned inwards, limping painfully towards me. She was emaciated. and gaunt and her eyes were glazed over. I spoke weakly. This was the end.\n\n\"Are you death?\" The woman shook her head, her face remaining emotionless.\n\n\"No, sweetheart, I ain't.\" Her voice had a distinct redneck-ish sort of t#BADWORDS#, and was gravelly with what must have been decades of smoking. Her affect was completely flat, like someone had ironed out her soul. \n\n\"But I wish I was dead. Wish I was you.\"\n\nI couldn't believe my #BADWORDS# ears. Even drugged out of my mind I had enough energy left in me to be angry.\n\n\"I'm sorry, what? Lady, I don't know your story, but you shouldn't ask to be me. You don't know what I've been through.\"\n\nHer washed-up, wrinkled old face *almost* curved into a smile, but in a flash it was gone again. \n\n\"Yes, I do. I know exactly who you is. and I'm here ter warn you about going to see Andrew today.\"\n\nAndrew. Andrew?! The man who just broke up with me! Realization flooded my body and soul and somehow I could just *sense* that this woman was a part of me. Maybe she was a messenger from heaven. Or from hell.\n\nShe reached into her pocket and retrieved a lighter and a cigarette. She took a long drag, choking as she exhaled. As she struggled to catch her breath, she answered the questions forming in my mind.\n\n\"No, honey pie, I'm YOU.\" \n\nMy eyes went wide with shock. How in the world could this poor haggard creature be ME? She certainly wasn't half as well-spoken or well-looked-after as I was. She continued.\n\n\"I went to see Andrew, finally. I went to go live with him.\"\n\nI didn't understand. Where was the diamond ring Andy had promised us? Where were the fancy clothes and the car and the whole taking-care-of-us-forever of which he so ardently spoke?\n\n\"Did he break up with us?\"\n\nThe other me sighed, but her face betrayed no emotion. \"No. he never left me, ever. When I got there he forced me into his car, he drugged me, and then he #BADWORDS# me, and he sold me to men. I got addicted to the heroin he gave me. I couldn't leave. I been #BADWORDS# thousands of times, I been shot, I been beaten, I been choked...\" she trailed off. \n\nWe stared at each other for a long and empty moment. She continued when I wouldn't. \"This is my life. I'm just another junkie, just another #BADWORDS#. I was supposed to come here to warn you. You still have a husband who loves you. You still have medicine for your bipolar. You still have a #BADWORDS# *bed*!\" At last her tough exterior broke and she began to openly sob and wail, making no effort to hide it in front of me.\n\n\"We both had it all!\" she groaned. \"And now we don't, neither of us don't have nothin'.\" she sunk to the floor in tears beside me. A woman more miserable than I slumped beside me on a desolate Wednesday morning, my only companion in death. A few silent tears rolled out of my own eyes as I drew my last breath. Maybe the next life would be better for both of us.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410069350","downs":0,"edited":"1410069672","gilded":0,"id":"ckbe40p","link_id":"t3_2fonl3","name":"t1_ckbe40p","parent_id":"t3_2fonl3","retrieved_on":1427157027,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

I moved out of the city, started a small repair business in a town in the middle of nowhere. Safe from all the craziness. Only a few thousand people. Every year some adventurous college students would come for adventure, just a few hundred. They all said they'd had more fun here than in Cancun or wherever Spring Break was traditionally held these days.  Also, more sex. Being in the middle of nowhere doesn't leave much to do. Explore the woods, hike up the mountain, fish, drive the backroads and take in the scenery. You end up spending time with your friends. Its the best life.\n\nThis year was different. I had heard rumors of more violent shows making the air, even some where unknowing contestants might die. When tourist season started, some of the students mysteriously disappeared. Then they found the body. It was in the middle of town, ritualistically displayed overnight. Most of the college guys left, along with a fair number of residents. Only a few hundred residents and about twenty college kids stayed. A few of the idiots talked excitedly about how they might be on a new show. That ended when four of them were killed in one night in front of them. Then the phones went out. The roads got blocked.\n\nI found a camera. It was as I inspected the landslide blocking the east road out of town. I noticed some frayed wires in the rubble and followed them. A broken piece of equipment was laying by the side of the road. Most of it was unrecognizable, but the cracked remains of a camera lens was laying there for all to see. All who looked. I kept my knowledge quiet and let the college kids get picked off. But when there were only three left, they took old Harold. Ninety three years old and refused to leave.\n\nI got together some equipment and worked in my shop. I kept all the lights off so the tv guys couldn't tell what I was doing. When you've done this long enough your senses only slow you down.

David hated salt water when it dried on his skin and becomes unpleasant. He shuffled through the sand. He was hungry and sore. He looked at his hands. \n\n\"49\" it read on his left hand.

He took the torch and made his way in. \n\nThe cave expanded into an open room that lead downward, followed by being split into four paths. David chose the second one from the left and began to descend. As he ventured further in, the path got narrower and smaller. David got into a crawling position and made his way forward. The path led to a wall. In this wall was a small 2x2 foot hole. He stuck his head out and looked around. David looked around, his torch whimpered in fear and the room echoed in size. David sensed that he had entered a very large cavern. He spat down and only a moment later heard the spit hit the surface of water.\n\nHe placed the torch by the hole and climbed out, hanging over the edge. He lowered himself until his body full extended, and released. As he fell further away from the torch, the rush of cold water hit David's spine like ice cream on teeth. He quickly syarted to swim up and away from the torch, hoping to hit some rock he could climb above. David reached a couple rocks and climbed over them. He look above and all around him, and saw  only darkness. He walked forward into the darkness, from now on, he'd feel his way forward. After a few steps, a little red light came on in front of him.\n\n\"Passcode.\" A little female voice droned out. And a little keypad ejected outward. \n\nDavid thought back to the numbers on his left hand and punched them into the keypad. A door slid open and lights came on. A small shack made it's presence know with a sudden, strong smell of mint. A Keurig machine poured boiling water into a mug with a tea bag already in it. The Keurig sat on a small oak table on the right wall, a clock sat on the right side, three of them actually. All three a few hours apart. In the very back left corner sat what looked like a large metal cooler. To his left wad a rocking chair. David loved rocking chairs, and sat down immediately. He feet hurt from the dark voyage, and he was too lazy to take off his wet clothes.\n\nDavid looked forward and in the far right corner lied a computer terminal. The room was lit by two florescent bulbs, the floor tiled black, white, and and blue. The walls were made of this strange dark wood. David got up and made his way to the computer. He sat down at the typical office space desk swivel chair and moved the mouse. A second line of words appeared on the screen.\n\n\"PRESS THE ENTER KEY.\"\n\nAnd as so, David pressed the enter key. Suddenly, he heard a ringing sound come from the computer. Then it ended.\n\n\"David! How's my favorite son of a #BADWORDS#?!\" Said a man, booming with energy. \n\n\"Uhhmm, hello?\"\n\n\"David it's me, Jake!\"\n\nDavid recalled something funny, but it didn't gully register. Something that concerned an insurance company.\n\n\"Do I know you?\" David asked blankly.\n\n\"Oh boy. Michael, get me his coords again. I want his coords, get him his gear, I need 100 pounds in explosives, a jeep, and ahhh....coffee. We're gonna need a lot of coffee.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410143666","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckc552r","link_id":"t3_2fpo5r","name":"t1_ckc552r","parent_id":"t3_2fpo5r","retrieved_on":1427133378,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":true,"author":"turnpike37","author_flair_css_class":"MOD","author_flair_text":"Moderator","body":"I've decided to celebrate this evening, an anniversary of the night one thousand years removed from my curious encounter with fate, alone with a particularly sweet malmsey. It was the last vestige of stock I’d been holding for a millennium. As I drank I wondered how much a bottle would go for today. Would a wine auction house even be able to establish its provenance? Unlikely. The bottle which may have once had a label has long since faded. The CEO at the brokerage firm for which I work likes to flaunt ‘ancient’ vintages from his wine cellar. I often overhear the top executives talk about this or that dinner party where they cracked open a bottle from the 1400s, as if that century was anything to remember. Now the 1500s, sailing for adventure with the explorers and getting a European’s first taste of the rums and women of this new world, that was a time to reminisce about.\n\nWhy I would be whiling away my time clerking in a brokerage firm? You’d likely not believe me, but after many centuries of living high and famously, it interested me to live in the lower caste again. (It would be boastful and braggadocio of me to say here that you would have heard of me many times over and again in your history books. Do try querying /r/askhistorians for any figures through antiquity who bore striking resemblances.) Perhaps it was a twinge of nostalgia for my youth of being ordered around by a crass master with little care given to my health and well-being that brought me to this humble profession. I can leave this simple life whensoever I choose, of course. It would likely be beyond your comprehension, the amount of wealth that one builds up over ten centuries.\n\nAh, but that bottle of malmsey, I recall trading for it along with several jugs of hypocras from a merchant in Abancourt soon after my transition. Even with a millennium of nights (that's 365,242 sunsets) to ponder my particular curiosity, I don’t quite know how to describe the change. I was apprenticed to a silversmith who sought a way to stretch the precious silver from which he worked. A traveling alchemist was said to be attending a near-by bazaar. My master sent me to learn if the alchemist could be of any assistance in deceptive metallurgy. The answer, as it turned out, was no. But the man did talk me into assisting him in some experiment he was attempting. My fee was to be dinner and a bed so I need not travel back to my master’s shop in the dead of the night.\n\nChildren read and laugh at fairy stories where some wizard calls for wild fantastical items like eye of newt, pizzle of a recently gelded bull or a thistle plucked at midnight alongside a flowing brook. But those were precisely the types of ingredients the alchemists, potionists and doctors of my youth would use. \n\nWhat odd concoction the alchemist pestled together, I don’t know. I was made to drink and recall nothing more of that night. I woke up under a tree near where the alchemist had set up his tent at the fair. The man had long since disappeared, most certainly unaware of his successful experiment and likely thinking me dead. Nor did I know of his success (if immortality was what he was trying to achieve) until a decade later, released from my apprenticeship and a master silversmith myself. I caught a chance glimpse of myself one day in some custom I was working on and noticed my face had not changed while so many of my fellow villagers were showing the hard features of their middle to late years.\n\nI fled as it became apparent that I would not age. Abancourt was overseen by a rather zealous bishop who would certainly deem me an abomination to his Christianity.\n\nFor many decades I chose to help those around me. I consoled the sickest victims of the Black Death, never fearing the scythe myself. For some other centuries I ac#BADWORDS#ulated wealth off the backs of the men more common than I ever was and even grander wealth thanks to the corruptions of the faith.\n\nAh, but I’ll stop before I bore you with a thousand years of my personal history. The last sips of malmsey, the final taste of everything I’ve brought with me over the centuries, are all that remain in my glass. And I choose to have these few moments to myself.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410289360","downs":0,"edited":"1410301642","gilded":0,"id":"ckdnzd4","link_id":"t3_2fxdtw","name":"t1_ckdnzd4","parent_id":"t3_2fxdtw","retrieved_on":1427105324,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":10}

{"archived":true,"author":"writebetter","body":"Probably not my best and a little long but I tried for you.  \n\nI've never been much for amu#BADWORDS#t parks. Motion sickness, a weak stomach, glasses that just *love* to fly off with the slightest of force, the perfect trifecta for reasons not to go. But Austin just wouldn't shut up about the new one that opened up. So lo and behold after much deliberation and pleading I found my self standing in line waiting to enter. The line seemed to take forever, the kind of forever that makes watching snails race or grass grow an exciting activity. When it was our turn the ticket lady asked us how many were in our group. \"Just two,\" Austin said.  \"That'll be sixty dollars.\" Thirty dollars a pop seemed steep to me. Austin pulled out six crumpled tens and slid them under the Plexiglas into the metal tray. The lady grabbed it, counted it, and returned two tickets. Austin was ecstatic at this point. He pranced through the gate like a child at Disneyland for the first time. I drudged through after him.  \n  \nThe park didn't seem anything special to me. It was like every other one I had been forced to go to. Loud, roaring roller coasters, pointless knick knacks that I'm sure were way over priced. The usual. I followed Austin as he lead me to the real reason I'd come. Two of his hot friends were here and I was a sucker for a blonde. \"Hey Emily, hey Sammie!\" Austin yelled as he jogged over to them. Emily sat on a bench scribbling something into a notebook. She held up her left hand shielding herself from Austin as she finished writing.  \n\"About time you got here Austin, we've been waiting,\" Emily said closing her notebook and sticking then pen down the spiral binding. Sammie locked eyes with me. She had the most stunning green eyes I'd ever seen. Jade and vibrant. She definitely my type of girl.  \n  \nWe all talked as we made our way to the best ride in the park. It was some virtual reality ride. It was supposed to be gentle enough that I wouldn't get sick. It was my chance to put my moves on Sammie. When we got to the front of the line I nearly lost it. The attendant at the front looked like Goofy if he'd been beaten by a swathe of ugly sticks. As we boarded the cart we were handed goggles that we were supposed to wear. With my glasses, they had a hard time staying on. I had to physically hold them up making me look as much of a dork as Goofy. It was a dent in my pick up game for sure.  \n  \nAs the ride started some special effect burst into action. A \"wormhole\" opened up at the end of the tunnel as the cart lurched toward it. It was completely lame. If this was the extent of the ride I wanted nothing of it. I  let the goggles slouch off. To my surprise the special effect looked much better without the goggles on. I turned to Sammie and had her pull them off. \"Wow so much better!\" she said with a wide smile. I smirked back trying to play it cool.  \"I still want to keep my goggles on though, maybe it gets better!\" My smirk subsided.\n  \nOnce we went through the \"wormhole\" we were allowed to leave the cart and walk around. That was supposed the be attraction of this ride, we were now supposed to be in a virtual world. To me it just looked like we'd come out to another part of the building. I turned to Sammie as our cart came to a stop and started to drop a line but she was already gone. To her, this was the best thing ever. Maybe she wasn't so great after all. I was starting to feel left out of the group with the three of them running off together. However, I was committed to enjoying myself. So I ran off after them.  \n  \nThey made their way to this flashy food court, no doubt made to look “Cool”. Emily and Austin had decided they wanted to try some food in this world. Whatever. If they took their goggles off they would have seen that it was just normal food. Something was odd though. Emily was using her left hand to eat. In between bites she would jot down something in her notebook. I could have sworn she was right handed earlier. Oh well. \"Hey you guys left without me?\" I said as I sat down beside them.  \n\"Sorry just caught up in the moment you know?\" Austin replied. He looked so dumb in the goggles. \"This is so fake, the goggles just make things cartoon-ey. Take them off you'll see,\" I said throwing my goggles on the table in front of me.  \n\"Hey man chill, It's just a ride. We didn't mean to be rude.\" Sammie took her goggles off again and smiled at me. Something was wrong again. Her eyes were brown. I was certain they were green before. I remember thinking about how they looked jade like!  \n\"What's going on? Your eyes are green weren't they Sammie? And you're right handed right Emily?\" I said glancing back between them. Everyone looked at me like I'd just confessed to being crazy.  \n\"You okay man? You look a little pale. Sammie has always had brown eyes and Emily has always been left handed.\" Austin said with the nodding approval of the girls.  \n  \nTwo men from the park had me in their grasps before I could react. They held my under my arms with a forceful grip. The bigger of the two men started, \"we are going to have to escort you out of the ride, you were supposed to keep the goggles on at all times.\" The group just starred as they dragged me away. What friends they were.  \n  \nI spent ten minutes outside waiting for them to come out. I had brewed quite the rant through my head as I waited. They were going to get an earful from me. As they walked out the exit Emily was writing in her notebook again with her **right** hand. \"Hey there you are! Where'd you go?\" Austin asked. It all caught me off guard. I must have looked bewildered because Sammie asked if I was okay. Her eyes were green again.  \n\"Wha-- what do you mean? Don't you remember the park guys escorting me out?\" I said. They looked at me confused. I was starting to feel dizzy. The whole thing made no sense to me. The last thing I remember was my knees becoming weak.  \n  \nWhen I woke up I was in a hospital. It wasn't any like I'd ever been in before. The doctors looked more like scientist to me. My head was throbbing. I must have hit my head when I fainted. Just my luck. I tried to move my hand to touch my head but I found that I was restrained in the bed. My heart started racing as I realized I was trapped. A doctor came in holding a clipboard. He sat down on the stool next the bed. His eyes were gray and thin, wispy, white hairs clung to his chin like holdovers from a bad shave. “Can you tell me what you experienced?” He said. He voice was much louder and clearer than I would have expected. I looked at him refusing to answer.  \n“Where am I?” I asked starring him in the eye.\n“In truth, You're in the theme park hospital, but it's where you were that is interesting!” His gray eyes beamed with excitement as he spoke. Passion wall welling up behind his eyes.  \n“What do you mean?”  \n“The ride is actually a wormhole to a parallel universe, you discovered this when you went in without you goggles on,” he started, “it's a bit technical but the goggles act a stabilizer. They make you the you that belongs in that universe. But you took them off. You became you in our universe, in theirs!” His eyes danced in excitement as he explained. He loved every second of this. “So what did you see?”  \n“I saw Emily use her opposite hand and Sammie had brown eyes instead of green,” I replied with caution. “Can I go now?”  \n“Interesting! Interesting! I'll make sure to report these findings. Thank you for allowing us to run this little experiment!”  \n“But can I go?” I was getting nervous I was worried they weren't going to let me go. This isn't what I wanted.  \n“Certainly! But I'm afraid we can't allow you to remember any of this. Security purposes. I'm sure you understand,” The mans smile faded as he grabbed a breathing mask. He held it over my nose as I slowly drifted away.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410320759","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cke3h1s","link_id":"t3_2fw92m","name":"t1_cke3h1s","parent_id":"t3_2fw92m","retrieved_on":1427097955,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

The sun should be up in a couple hours, and the Riders will be here at the crack o’ dawn, guaranteed.”\n\n“We can’t leave, you know that. The elderly and the children won’t survive long on the open road. And besides, there isn’t enough time,” the Mayor said, frustration building in her tone.\n\nA cold gust of wind blew past the trio as the gunfighter hesitated before replying. The soft creaking of floorboards from the porch broke the short silence. It was the old man’s grandson, a strong boy of twelve, the oldest of the children in the town. “We can win,” he said with confidence. “There are still a few boxes of bullets in our supply, and I’ve been practicing my shot.”\n\n*These people are all gonna die if they don’t leave in the next hour,* thought the gunfighter. *Hell, if I wait any longer, I’ll probably end up dead too.* The gunfighter glanced at the old man, who appeared deep in thought.\n\n“What if,” the old man said to the gunfighter, “What if we were to make it worth your while?”\n\n“Trust me, ol’ man, there ain’t nothin’ in this town you could offer that’d persuade me.”\n\n“We have a working radio,” the old man confessed. “It’s of no use to us if we die tomorrow.”\n\n“You have a *what?*” exclaimed the gunfighter.\n\n“That is *not* yours to give away!” The Mayor shouted. “We agreed to use it as our bargaining chip with the Riders.”\n\n“Show it to me,” the gunfighter said softly, hints of excitement in his voice.\n\nThe old man looked at the Mayor, “You know they’re just going to kill us and take it anyway. It’s a flawed plan.”\n\n“And who’s to say *he* won’t do the same? Do you know what you’ve just done?”\n\nThe old man looked down at the gunfighter’s holster and noticed the strap had been unsnapped. The gun was ready to be drawn.\n\n*“Show. Me. The radio.”*\n\nBefore the old man or the mayor could speak, the young boy walked up to them with a box in his hands. He set down the box and opened it up. There, laying in the box and neatly surrounded by foam, was a well-kept extended-rage radio. The gunfighter #BADWORDS#ed it right out of the box and flipped the antiquated ‘ON’ switch.\n\nStatic. The Mayor and the old man began to argue, but the gunfighter couldn’t make out their words. *This is the most beautiful sound I’ve ever heard. What if they’re still alive?* A rush of feeling, emotions, and adrenaline filled the gunfighter’s body and mind. *This is my chance. It’s in my hands. I can just take this and leave. She might still be alive.*\n\nAfter a few moments, the gunfighter looked up at the Mayor and the old man with a frightening intensity. Everyone froze, everyone except the boy. He patted the gunfighter on the shoulder. “Help us,” he said. \n\nBut the gunfighter didn’t hear the boy at all. He heard a voice that he hadn’t heard in eleven years, four months, and six days. *You wouldn’t want me to leave these people, would you?* The gunfighter closed his eyes. *Annabelle, I’m going to find you. I’ll help these people, and I’ll find you.*\n\nThe gunfighter turned the radio off, carefully placed it back in the box, and closed the lid. No one dared move a muscle. The gunfighter rose, and in an almost annoyed tone, said, “I’ll get the claymores and smoke gre#BADWORDS#es from my pack. Start loading ammo. Lots of ammo.”\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410638170","downs":0,"edited":"1410639070","gilded":0,"id":"ckhdxw7","link_id":"t3_2gawjb","name":"t1_ckhdxw7","parent_id":"t3_2gawjb","retrieved_on":1427029153,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

Any other surviving species rallied to their colonies hoping to find safety. Instead found over-population leading to food shortages and more death. Silence took them all, just like Silence takes everything in the end. I find it funny how ironic the lengths people went to keep the silence away. \n\nIt was a subconscious thing. Nothing was ever really silent as a child or through your life. The hum of the engines if you lived on a Station, the sounds of the wilderness outside your house if you were planet side. Nothing was ever truly silent until you died. \n\nDepressing. I know, look wherever your listening from, however you are listening I thank you kindly for listening to the thoughts of this old man.

{"archived":true,"author":"fusterc1uck","body":"“Another day, another das#BADWORDS#ly terrorist plot, and another heroic derring-do to save the day. Mr. Empath, how on earth do you do it?”\n\n“Well Jim, every morning I get up to look at my ugly mug in the mirror and try to eliminate all thoughts of self-loathing. Whenever you hear me groan that’s me asking myself why I didn’t sign on with the bad guys.”\n\n“Haha! There’s our hero’s sense of humor. Dry as always. My name’s not Jim by the way. That aside, there’s something people want to know. Who is your nemesis Black Bomb? What is she like? We’ve all heard various things about her.”\n\n“Black Bomb is an interesting villain. For instance, today she thoroughly explained to me why showers in the morning were most effective before detonating the explosives attached to the bank vault.”\n\n“Was it a tactic to distract you?”\n\n“No. We talk frequently because she and I like to catch up before we do business. We’re almost friends now. Sometimes she’ll come say hello at my apartment and we’ll have some pizza.”\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“It’s easier that way. She can tell me where she’s going to strike next and I’ll just play along, telling her how bad she is, how dangerous of a game she’s playing. It’s a blast for her. And it’s not like I’ll be able to stop her from doing what she wants anyway. So that’s just how it is. How on earth do you think I would reach her in time if she didn’t tell me beforehand?”\n\n“I see…That is very strange. But we’ll move on. Today you saved a particular person today from certain death, Ms. Casey. She had a certain message for you, Mr. Empath.”\n\n“That reporter chick with platinum blond hair? She’s been pestering me for ages now asking for an interview at that new French restaurant. I’m sure she’ll be on YouTube tomorrow, so no need to show me some silly footage now.”\n\n“Err, okay then Mr. Empath. We’ll move on again. During today’s bank robbery when Black Bomb strapped one of her signature explosives to your chest, how on earth did you survive?”\n\n“I used my ultimate ability to take control of her mind for a few short minutes. And she herself defused the explosive. After all, no bomb specialist in the world has been able to defuse one of her contraptions.”\n\n“That sounds like a powerful ability. Is it more difficult to manipulate a villain like Black Bomb who is rumored to be rather intelligent?”\n\n“Ingenious is more like it. And yes, her emotions tend to be densely meshed; it’s hard to sift through a person like BB.”\n\n“What did you sense while inside her mind? Hatred? Murderous intent?”\n\n“Cheerfulness, actually. She’s enthusiastic about going to work in the morning. Usually the bad guy’s some unhappy bum spurned by society. But she’s an optimistic bad… guy. In my line of work, a happy villain is a bad omen. Like a hero’s gonna get hitched or something.”\n\n“I see, that does sound quite troubling. Could you elaborate?”\n\n“Getting married means retirement. And from what I’ve heard from my friend, Mr. Awesome, it’s a complete nightmare. Also, babies with superpowers. Have you seen how much vomit a normal baby can produce? It’s like an acidic fire hydrant. Now can you imagine a superbaby left in your living room for thirty minutes? I shiver from just the thought.”\n\n“Hold on Mr. Empath, you’ve been surviving confrontations with Black bomb by manipulating her for whole minutes? When she visits you personally or when you have any other chance, why not simply arrest her?”\n\n“The truth is Jim, that I’m not a true superhero. She’s found her passion or calling in life and unfortunately society has no choice but to shake its head at her. When it’s against Black Bomb, I’m not fighting for the greater good. I’m there to make sure nobody gets hurt. She’s there to watch the fireworks.”","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410746778","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckijbqd","link_id":"t3_2gdkjl","name":"t1_ckijbqd","parent_id":"t3_2gdkjl","retrieved_on":1427008693,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

I made sure to be careful with the timing. Just as I set the star on the tree the oven began to beep. There were 60 seconds left on the timer. I quickly hopped down from the ladder and ran into the kitchen, pulling the door open just as the timer began to beep incessantly, and pulled the turkey from the oven. \n\nI let go of the oven and let it drop an inch above the stove. Even with the mitt it was still extremely hot. My fingers were singed a bit, but they cooled easily with some water. \n\nThe doorbell rang. I hurriedly made my way to the door and opened it quickly with a smile. \n\n\"Hey.\" I said with a smile.\n\n\"Hey.\" He said back. I could see he was trying to smile but I could tell he was uncomfortable. Anyone else would be. It was an awkward situation. \n\n\"Are you alright?\" \n\n\"I'll be fine. Don't worry.\" He said. It reassured me. He seemed honest about it. \n\nAfter a moment I brought him inside. He made a nice comment about my dress as he sat on the couch and I took it humbly. He'd never been to this house before. I'd only ever really been to his and we went out a lot. We'd been dating about a year now and I figured if he was really going to be the one for me that this was something he would have to get used to. I didn't plan to stop anytime soon. Or ever, for that matter. \n\nI only get one chance a year after all. I save every penny from every paycheck for this chance; 52 paychecks a year for this one day. \n\n\"Are you sure you're ready?\" I turned to him and asked. He looked up at me from his folded hands in his lap and let out a deep breath. \n\n\"I suppose so.\" \n\nI went over to the projection display where her personality profile was stored.

I could see, too, like a seam, the loose threads, the frayed edges, little strings of sky along the hole. They were small but they were distant, and I supposed if I had gotten closer, they would have been giant, the size of jetliners, maybe, or skysc#BADWORDS#s--they were too far to say for certain.\n\nThe strings were the color of sky--not blue exactly, not black, not gray, but *sky.* \n\nThey eddied and waved along the edges hole.

I was reminded of being ten, of being with my parents at the Grand Canyon, of stepping as close to the abyss as I could do. I remembered the urge to take one step more. Just one step or slip on the sandy red rocks. It would be a step to my sure death, but also to falling and to weightlessness and to irreversible certainty, to one sure direction. Looking at that hole, I knew that if I was sucked up into it, if I could figure out away to step over that edge, to let go of those fraying strings of sky--if I fell, I would never come back.\n\nI leaned forward onto the toes of my slippered feet.

{"archived":true,"author":"be-here-now","body":"The first knock was quiet and unassuming. Garren's unconscious attempted to process the noise as familiar creaking from an old house, but something about those three quick taps sent a jolt through his chest. Maybe his reaction had more to do with the novel he was currently reading than anything else: *Carrie*, by Stephen King. His hosts had been gracious enough to leave behind their extensive collection of literature, all of which were either horror or romance novels. Reading scary stories probably didn't make sleeping any easier, but the alternative was either just plain stupid or severely depressing. At least they gave the imagination something to be frightened of that wasn't real. Anyway most of what he'd read so far, although implausible, wasn't nearly as bad as what he'd seen since the change.\n\nJust as the memory of the sound began to fade from his mind, it returned with a jolt. Those taps were too uniform and abrupt to be creaking wood. It was a familiar sound, there was no denying that much, but not one that Garren had heard for a very long time. It was a sound that carried intention. His realization was echoed by another set of identical knocks. They seemed louder than before, or maybe that was just the adrenaline. Something was outside.\n\nGarren was on his feet, moving quietly down the stairs. The barrel of his shotgun was cold and comforting in his hand. He confirmed from memory that the gun was in fact loaded, eyes never leaving the door as he raised the stock to his shoulder. A third set of knocks, no louder than before, made his grip tighten involuntarily. Garren gave his muscles a few breaths to relax before continuing his descent.\n\nGarren paused again at the landing below the stairs as he realized his dilema. So long as he held his gun in a position from which he could fire it, he was unable to get close enough to the door to look through the little peephole. Perhaps a smaller gun is a better choice when expecting visitors.\n\nAs Garren lowerd the weapon to his side and stepped forward, a voice sounded from the other side of the door. It was a male voice, and it sounded strange. It was cheerful. \"Hello Garret, do you have a few minutes talk about our lord and savior, Jesus Christ?\"\n\n\"W-Who... That's not my...\" There were a million thoughts bouncing around in his head and the only one that seemed to stick was that he hdan't spoken to anyone in over three years. He wasn't sure if he even remembered how.

They just reaped the rewards.*\n\n*Life used to rule over them all, but this was inevitable. Their cities now were ruins and those who had remained left to ally with others.*\n\n*The four warring nations had one alliance. The passive elements, Air and Water, were an easy pair. They had sneakier attacks, political games. Their defence was solid, and Air could easily put Fire out of the game. It was Fire's mastery of machinery that kept them in the game. Their offence was good too, but against Earth, everyone was surprised they had survived this long.*\n\n*It seemed Death only wanted to stand back. They could help anyone win the war. Their army of the dead was unfathomably huge. But they remained neutral. For now.*\n\nI stepped through the bar doors. The honky tonk piano played an upbeat melody. Heads turned in my direction as I whistled along. My heels clicked across the metal floor. Most of the things in the establishment were metal. I felt eyes, burning with hatred, on me. I sat at the free stool and leaned over it, head down. I've always found aeromancers associate with the Living. They shared that deep hatred for the Dead. I smiled behind my cowl. Good.\n\nA man approached me but I didn't move. I raised my head and asked the bartender for the cheapest drink. He spat in a glass then poured me some water. He continued to glare at me.\n\nI waited for the stranger to make a move. Perhaps he would blow me away? Or maybe suffocate. Surprisingly, he asked me to leave first. He spoke gruff. I turned my head slightly in his direction. \"Why? This is such a fine establishment.\" I spoke quietly, but sarcastically.\n\nHe blew a gust of wind and my head slammed into the metal bench. I lifted it slowly, rubbing it. I stood, and turned to him. I've been told I was tall, but this man was incredibly short. He stared up at me. I thought about my options. I could show them my wrath, go against everything I have stood for. I chose to speak. \"I know you are afraid.\"\n\nThey laughed. I ignored them.\n\n\"This war has made us shells of ourselves.\"\n\n\"Not you though! You and your friends all have a wonderful time behind those big walls don't you?\"\n\nAnother chorus of laughter.\n\nI held back my anger. \"That is why I am here.\" I spoke slowly, controlling myself.\n\nI paused, looking through their amused faces. \"I want to help you win.\"\n\nSome laughed. Others stared. I stood looking at them, awaiting a response.\n\nA woman up the back piped up.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I have watched your people die. I have watched their people die. Normally this should please me, but...\" I trailed off. I didn't know why I had to help. I just did.\n\n\"Why our side? Why not side with the pyromancers, you guys seem more closely aligned.\"\n\n\"We are not as alike as we seem. We see beauty in death, all they see is destruction.\" I spoke more bitterly than I had planned. \n\nThere was a silence. Too long. \n\nI sighed, then walked to the door. Nobody stopped me.\n\nI thought about Water next. They weren't too far away, barely three days wa-\n\n\"They don't know it. But we need you.\"\n\nI turned. She was dressed in a floral dress. It seemed to be some contrast from the metal surrounding. Her old eyes read me like a book. She was old, but she had a grace of youth about her.\n\n\"I wish they did.\" I said ruefully.\n\n\"They want to trust you. They know you want to help. But they want the truth.\"\n\nThat surprised me. \"The truth?\"\n\n\"They want to know why you are really here.\"\n\n\"I have to start somewhere.\"\n\n\"Start what?\"\n\nI was even more surprised. \"Winning this war.\" I said firmly.\n\n\"You don't want to win, you want something else.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean.\" I said, dumbfounded.\n\nShe studied me for a second, then spoke. \"I can see you're being honest, so I'll give you this: When you know what you want, come back to me.\" And with that she turned and strolled away. I watched her, and  when she was well over fifty metres away, she clicked her fingers.\n\nThe short man from earlier came out, looking embarrassed.\n\n\"Wait!\" He shouted. I snapped my attention to him.\n\n\"We may have been too hasty. A willing soldier is a good soldier.\" He held out a hand. I paused, then shook it firmly.\n\n.\n\nI knew it now. I had it. I knew what I wanted. I knew what this world needed.\n\nIt needed a leader. It needed me. One to unite them all. One who was outcast. Who carried no bias.\n\nThe realisation hit me in battle. Some pyromancers were about to scorch me, then one yelled \"Gettim!\"\n\nI managed to escape without bloodshed, but that exchange revealed to me something. They wanted to function together, but without a leader they didn't know when to fire.  \n\nThat's what I could do. I had a lifetime of studying each nation. I knew which ones were proud, honest, stubborn.\n\nWhen I stumbled through the bar doors again, the old lady in the floral dress was already gesturing me over.\n\n\"You know now?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"You know what you have to do?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"The ruins of the Living will give you insight.\"\n\nIt was brief. I didn't expect that.\n\n\"The council of Elders was picked from the purest of heart, from each of the nations. I think you will find that the council isn't what it used to be.\"\n\nI didn't know why she was being so cryptic. But I knew my path now.\n\nThe city of the Light was a three day ride away.\n\nBefore I could leave, though, a man ran up to me. Derek, aeromancer, had a family.\n\n\"You're leaving?\"\n\nI knew what he meant. I had been put on the front line for a week, but I knew how to end the war. That was all I knew now. I rode toward the land of the Living.\n\n.\n\nEven in ruin, I could see that the city was gorgeous. Buildings spiralled outward from what had to be my destination. They were made with a white material. Possibly marble. I followed the tiled stone road, following it's gentle curve. I reached the centre. The great domed building now was crumbled. I entered the doors, and, avoiding rubble, made it towards the centre.\n\nThere stood five statues, each emblazoned with their element. The sixth position was empty.\n\nI stepped forward. Stone eyes flicked to life. They looked down at me. Disapproving eyes studied me.\n\n\"Necrise, we have no need of you, you corrupted spirit.\" The one with a rock on it's chest said.\n\nI didn't know who Necrise was.\n\n\"If anyone is corrupted, it is you.\" I said, finding the words against these giants.\n\n\"We are better without you, Necrise, stronger.\" Said the Water one.\n\n\"No, you fools, you are weakened. You are blinded in your Divinity.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken. We have brought peace and prosperity.\"\n\n\"Peace? Do you see what is happening outside? Your city is in ruin. Your nations are killing each other. How do you see peace?\"\n\n\"I see no such ruin. You are lying, Necrise.\"\n\n\"It is in this building! There is rubble next to you! Your shoulder is covered with dust!\"\n\nIt turned it's stony neck. \"I see no dust.\"\n\nThis was getting infuriating. \"How are you so blind!?\" I shouted. They seemed taken aback.\n\n\"Your people are at war. You are sitting in a ruin. How do you fail to see this?\"\n\nI turned to the one with the life symbol etched on to it. It seemed to be focusing extra hard. I widened my eyes. I could see what was going on now.\n\n\"You are de#BADWORDS#able.\"\n\n\"Pardon?\" It replied. The others turned to it as well.\n\n\"You have blinded them with your light. You aren't saving us. You're killing us.\"\n\nThe statue was silent.\n\n\"You have blinded them. Your love of all things alive has stopped them from seeing the truth. They can't see evil because you are hiding them from it.\"\n\n\"I was protecting them.\" It spoke. The other statues were shocked.\n\n\"You weren't protecting them. You were killing us.\n\n\"How did you do it?\" I said after a silence.\n\n\"You evicted Necrise, but how? Did he show you pain? Did he show you suffering? Did he show you death? Did he show you life?\"\n\n\"He didn't show us life.\" The statue said quietly.\n\n\"What you are showing these guys isn't life either.\" I countered.\n\nThere was a silence. I walked up to the empty spot. I had no idea if this would work.\n\nI took a breath, then stepped into my position among statues. \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410955138","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckkr0ec","link_id":"t3_2gmb4m","name":"t1_ckkr0ec","parent_id":"t3_2gmb4m","retrieved_on":1426962479,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Now that should be clear enough, but she certainly isn't clear (did you see, dear jury, the judge accused her of being #BADWORDS#ue!), so it should be clear that she cannot be that! And if she is not that, she is not like that (that should be clear, you see?), therefore she is not that, but it!\"\n\nHe said all this with a flourish, and spun round to point at me at his final words with such great panache that his coat tails flew out behind him. The jury were murmuring quietly to each other in tones of agreement. They seemed to enjoy the show.\n\nThe Prosecution adjusted his glasses and then spoke so fast I felt the words whooshing past my ear: \"As she is her own defence, she is her own attack and we cannot even trust that she is not like that.\" He paused. \"Or should I say that *it* is not like that?\"\n\nThe Judge laughed heartily at that, his exhalations resounding through the open air, and he yelled into the sky happily as he brought his gavel crashing down onto the desk. \"That's it!\" he chuckled. \"That's it.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, this can't be good,\" I said quietly to myself. I had no wish to be misinterpreted again.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410974564","downs":0,"edited":"1410989832","gilded":0,"id":"ckkztrl","link_id":"t3_2go3gd","name":"t1_ckkztrl","parent_id":"t3_2go3gd","retrieved_on":1426958294,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":true,"author":"theafterbirthspecial","body":"Hark Tim and lo, my story of loss and woe!\n\nMay it spread far and wide so that others may learn from my folly. It was my seventh consecutive night at the Garden, that whole week I had eaten nothing but. I came upon a sudden realization, I had not had a bowel movement since! This realization was immediately followed by an excruciating pain from my lower abdomen. I sprinted into the restroom and made my way to a vacant stall. I dropped my trousers and lowered myself upon the porcelain seat. Oh how I pushed to free myself of a weeks worth of starch and tomato paste. Try as I might the waste would not budge. I was determined to release my excrement. I strained and strained for what surely must have been an hour. I cursed myself for not having gotten more fiber in my diet but I knew the temptation of the Olive had its vines wrapped around me. Finally, after much screaming I felt movement within my bowels. With a sudden rush the week’s delicacies came flying out of me like a rocket into space. However my muscles were still flexed, frozen in place from the exertion, something else was escaping from me. Once I relaxed my sphincter muscles I turned around to look in the toilet. It seemed I had shat out my entire digestive system. Shock took hold and I frantically grabbed at the organs. In the delirium I tried to replace my organs in the quickest possible manner. I began to devour them. I turned myself into a one man human centipede, nay a human mobius strip. Where did I begin and end anymore? I cried, not from the pain nor because I knew I was dying, but because life is beautiful and mine was too short to end. I thought of my friends and family, people to whom I wished I could have said goodbye. I wept for what felt like ages Tim. I wept for all the sunsets I would not see, for all the romances that could have been. Two rivers flowed down my face weaving paths as intricate as my own sorrow. As I finished my last meal I thought my final thought “I don’t want to die”.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1410983065","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckl4iy8","link_id":"t3_2gmodu","name":"t1_ckl4iy8","parent_id":"t3_2gmodu","retrieved_on":1426956031,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

The monsters come out at night.\n\nThere is a pattern of mourning. A regularity.

{"archived":true,"author":"Deradius","body":"\"This is it, kid.\"  My trainer sat, chomping a cigar while he wrapped up my hands.  He never lit the thing, said it would ruin my lungs, but he chomped on cigars non-stop on fight nights.  Had ever since we'd been in #BADWORDS# little dives in podunk towns.  \"How are you feeling?\"\n\nPavlo Zherdev was a beast.  Standing close to seven feet tall and weighing over two hundred and fifty pounds, he had dominated professional boxing for the last five years.  The most frightening things about him were his iron chin and his seemingly limitless stamina.  It's where he got his nickname; 'The Steam Engine'.  \n\nI had watched hours and hours of his fight tapes.  For the last three months, I had been having dreams of fighting this guy, and they always involved me feeling like my feet were in cement, or my arms were moving through Jello, or my punches landed like pillows.  I'd wake up sweaty and exhausted from beating on this guy in my dreams, always to no effect.  \n\n\"I don't feel much of anything,\" I said.  And it was mostly true.  Dreams like that were common before a big fight, and thus far, things had always seemed to work out for me.  I've got good defense and quick hands, and they'd always served me well so far.  Something was scratching at the back of my mind though; a concern about the possible match between my weaknesses, polished down to minor flaws by now, and Zherdev's strengths.\n\nMy trainer slapped me on the shoulder.  \"Attaboy.  Keep your head clear, kid.  Gotta take a piss.\"  He got up and wandered off to the bathroom for the fifth or sixth time.  I sat in the empty locker room, looking between my feet.  I felt my breath moving in and out of my lungs.  Felt my muscles flex and stretch as I shifted my weight.\n\nSomething was different.  At first I couldn't identify it, and then I realized the sound of the crowd, usually a constant, dull roar in the locker rooms before a fight, was gone.  I could have sworn I heard it few moments ago.  Had I imagined it?  Were the locker rooms that well insulated?  I got up and walked to the locker room door, looking up and down the hall.  It was silent.  No one was walking in the hallway.  I heard no sound anywhere in the building.  \n\nI felt a cold chill moving up my spine then.  I remembered rotten teeth, those horrible green eyes, and that cheap suit.  The smell of rotten eggs.  In my memory, I heard that voice, the voice I heard the night of my first match.  'Call me Lou,' he had said, followed by a wet hack and a used car salesman's attempt at a charming smile.  I knew what I would see when I turned around.\n\nAnd when I did turn around, there he was.  One blue suede shoe propped up on the bench in the locker room.  His suit was made of some sort of velveteen or satiny material.  He was dressed like a madman's speculation about a Vegas lounge singer might look like.  His greasy hair was combed over to one side.  He smiled at me with those brown, uneven teeth.  \"Little Mr. Dynamite,\" he said with a laugh.  \"Big things come in small packages.\"  He winked, then brought his hands up and pulsed his fingers out, miming and explosion.  \"Boom!\"\n\nHe gave a wheezing laugh.  Apparently, he'd amused himself.  \"You ready to take the deal, kid?\"  He #BADWORDS# his head at a briefcase, sitting on the opposite bench.  \n\n\"I told you, #BADWORDS#,\" I said.  \"I told you the first time I ever fought, I don't believe in that #BADWORDS#.\"  He smirked, inclined his head a little in acquiescence.  \"Fair enough,\" he said.  \"But then, if you don't believe it, it can't hurt to put ink to paper, can it?\"\n\nI shook my head.  \"I made it this far without you, I don't need you now.\"\n\nHe laughed, and it was a pitying laugh.  \"It's the end of the line, slim.  Here's where we see the difference between the great and the *almost* great.  How many people has old Pavlo put down?  I think I've lost count.\"  I knew the number.  It was a big number.  \"What makes you think you'll be any different?\"\n\nLou reclined on the bench, put his hands behind his head.\n\n\"Security!\", I shouted, and listened as my own words echoed off the walls.\n\n\"Not until our business is done and we've struck a deal or not,\" he said quietly.  \n\nI waited.  Listened to the drip, drip, drip of water falling from a shower head to a tile floor.  Lou kept his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\n\n\"You're going to get a cut over your left eye in the second round that's going to be distracting and it's going to make it hard to protect your left side.  You're going to hammer on him for four or five rounds, but you're going to find out it's like beating on a stump.  He's just going to keep grinning at you and trading punches, and every one of his is going to take something out of you.\"  He cleared his throat.  \"You're tough, so even blind and getting hit on your left side every few minutes, you're going to make it to the tenth round.  It's going to be a TKO, and after tonight, sports commentators are going to talk about would've, could've, should've, but other than a few local bouts over the next four or five years, no one's going to remember who you were.\"\n\nI glared at him.  I hated this bas#BADWORDS#.  I wanted him out.  \n\n\"Or,\" he said.\n\n\"Or, you sign this paper, you win this fight, and it's fame, fortune, and your name in lights.\"\n\nI needed to get this over with.  I needed to get this guy out of my head.  I wasn't supers#BADWORDS#ous, and now I had this story hanging over my head.  Pop always said you become what you see in your mind's eye, and Lou's story was playing out in flashes in my mind.  \n\n\"Give me the #BADWORDS# paper,\" I said, and before I finished the sentence Lou had sprung to his feet, slapping his hands together in enthusiasm.  \"Alright, now we're talking, kid.\"  In a flurry of motion he put a piece of old looking parchment on the back of a briefcase.  I didn't even read it; if I signed on the line, this mentally ill man would go away and leave me in peace.\n\nI took the fountain pen from his hand.  Felt a slight sting; perhaps a jagged edge on the body of the pen.  When I signed on the line, the ink was a deep, vibrant red that quickly faded to brown on the parchment.  Lou wrapped an arm around me like we were old comrades.  Cheap cologne, rotten eggs, and death.  \"I never lose a sale, not one this big.\"  He winked.  \"See you around, kid.\"  And off he went, through the locker room door.  \n\nAs soon as he walked out, my trainer walked in.  \"Where the #BADWORDS# have you been?  No time to argue, they're playing your song.  It's time to dance.\"  And I could hear it.  My entrance music.\n\nThe walk to the ring was a blur.  The crush of the crowd.  The staccato flashbulbs.  The shouts and screams.  The announcing, shouting out the vital statistics.\n\nAs the announcer spoke, I locked eyes with Pavlo.  He was a #BADWORDS#an of solid muscle.  He shook and snorted, stamped his foot like  a bull.  The crowd roared.  He looked hungry.  He looked ready.  We came to the center of the ring to touch gloves, and he slammed his gloves down on mine.  It felt like he was made of marble; it felt like I was going to be boxing Michaelangelo's David.  For a fraction of an instant I thought about Lou's blue suede shoes, and then the bell rang.\n\nI came out of my corner and Pavlo came out of his.  He threw a heavy right straight, and I moved my head to the left, felt the air as the punch blew over my shoulder.  I loaded up a right hook and let fly.\n\nWhen the punch connected, I felt a sickening crunch-crack that resonated from the point of impact all the way up my arm.  I watched Pavlo's head snap back and to the side, his eyes open in mute shock.  His head flopped around like a rag doll as a great streamer of blood issued from his mouth.  The shape of his left eye was all wrong, off-center in the socket.  He dropped to his knees, then down on his face.  The referee started to count, but seeing the expanding pool of blood beneath Pavlo's head and the way his legs twitched, he waved the medical team in.\n\nThe crowd, unaware of the gravity of the situation, was roaring.  In the front row, in the center, I saw a man with crooked brown teeth in a moth eaten velveteen suit and blue suede shoes slowly clapping, a slight smirk on his face.  I stared into his eyes and felt like I was falling down a hole.  The referee held my arm up, the announcer said something, and I heard none of it.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1411215674","downs":0,"edited":"1411222484","gilded":0,"id":"cknjltc","link_id":"t3_2gxx2t","name":"t1_cknjltc","parent_id":"t3_2gxx2t","retrieved_on":1426909429,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

She looks so small in that bed.\n\nI sit in the chair next to her bed and take her cool hands in mine.\n“I told you I would come, just you know, things have been busy”, I say lamely. She smiles at me, her eyes travelling all over my face.\n\n“Tell me what you've been up to”, she asks. She gives my hand a little squeeze.\n\n“Well, um, you know, just work and stuff. I might get distract manager soon though. A position is opening up and the other managers keep telling me the big wigs are throwing around my name a lot. So that's good.”\n\nShe swallows several times before speaking.\n\n“That's good. Rick has got some big case right now. It's even been on the news. How's the family?”\n\nI want to go back and tell her that I've worked myself to exhaustion for this for five years, and it's pretty much a given at this point, as I've been given an offer. I want to tell her I'll be making $120,000 a year. But I just go on, because I know I'll only get the same response even if I elaborate.\n\n“They're good, real good.” I could tell her that my wife and I just celebrated our 15th anniversary, more in love than ever. I could tell her that our oldest is in an accelerated learning program and already has several college offers, and wants to become a NICU doctor. That our youngest might literally be a sports prodigy, and is looking at going to the olympics as soon as she's old enough. That my family life is more than I could have ever dreamed, and I make sure to praise all my children equally.\n\n“That's good.” She smiles. I can see she means it, but... “I think Kat's gonna marry her movie star soon.    She'll be set for life!” She gives a little chuckle.\n\n“Where's everyone else?” I ask, changing the subject.\n\nShe waves one of her hands, “Oh, you know. Kat's off with her movie star boyfriend, in the Maldives? I think. Rick's got his really big, high profile case, so he couldn't come. Lizzie, well, you know she just got out of rehab, and she's feeling a little fragile right now, so she couldn't make it. But she's doing really, really well, you know? Back with her husband, got a new job. I know how hard she's had it. I'm just so proud of her. Isn't it just great that she could get past all that business?”\n\n“Ya, that's good. That's..that's really good.” I smile at her, but it flees as soon as I lower my head. My ears feel hot.\n\n“Listen, David...the doctor was here a little bit ago. He says...he says it's getting worse.”\n\nI look back up at her strangely youthful, glowing face. She didn't look worse.\n\n“I don't want you to worry honey. It doesn't hurt, I really feel just fine.” Right then she has a coughing fit, and afterward she's swallowing so compulsively for so long that I rush to prop her higher on the pillows and give her her glass of water. After a few small sips, she's better, and she smiles at me. Her eyes are different though, more serious. She know's I've seen through her lie.\n“Anyway, that's why I wanted you to come see me, you know, to catch up.” She grabs my hands in hers. They're chilled. Mindlessly I start rubbing them between mine to warm them.\n\n“There's not much for us to catch up on mom. Everything's...you know, pretty much the same.” I say, shrugging. I get up and stand looking out at the big picture window.\n\n“Well I see you've lost a little bit of weight, tell me about that.”\n\nI look her in the eyes, and even though she's smiling, I know she can see the look on my face.\n\n“I've lost 45 pounds. My cholesterol is perfect. Lily and I ran a 5k together two weeks ago. I've got tons more energy. I sleep better. I feel great!” I'm a little too loud, and I can feel that my smile is a little toothy. I turn back to the window.\n\n“Oh, that's great! Good for you. Lizzie lost a lot of weight in rehab you know, but then started gaining it back like crazy after she got home. She got on a diet and is doing really well with it! She's lost like, six pounds I think? Maybe seven? Just eating right you know, and exercising, and of course getting off-”\n\n“I thought I was here so we could catch up, Mom.” I say pointedly.\n\nShe gives a little huff. “Well, I just thought you'd like to know what your siblings are up to. There all doing so well, you know, and it makes me proud -”\n\n“Do I make you proud?” It sounds raw, even to my own ears, and I feel terrible because I've swallowed this my entire life, and here at the end of hers, I can't just leave it be. \n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“Do I make you proud?” I say, advancing to her bedside with my hands on my hips. “Well, do I?”\n\n“Of course you do, you know that -”\n\n“Really? Because no matter what I do, I get a little pat on the head, and then you go on singing the praises of one of them.” I loved my siblings, and I really was proud of them. But damn, I was too raw to sit through this again. I didn't have much time left with my mother, and all she wanted to talk about was the accomplishments of my brothers and sisters. \n\n“Do you ever brag about me to them, Mother?”\n\nHer face said all I needed to know, and it cut deep.\n\nHands gripped on the back of the chair, I ask, “Can't we just have one conversation before you die where I get to be the focus of your attention?” I feel my heart break, both because I asked that stupid question, and also because I even had to ask it.\n\n“Oh, honey...I..”\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1411245133","downs":0,"edited":"1411245780","gilded":0,"id":"cknuctc","link_id":"t3_2gyduh","name":"t1_cknuctc","parent_id":"t3_2gyduh","retrieved_on":1426904272,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":false,"author":"oooo0o","body":"There I was, sitting in the front seat of Jim's car. Jim asked me if I enjoyed the party to which I replied yes. We started driving down the winding back roads in order to get home. Thinking that we we're alone, we accelerated till the colors on the horizon started to blur. As the orange horizon faded to purple a white light appeared before the car. Jim didn't notice, he was wiping the puke from his lips while changing songs on his radio. \n\nI felt myself falling, opened my eyes and saw my cat laying on my bed. I looked around and saw that it was 9:23. The same time in the dream on the dashboard of the car. My phone vibrated, it was a text from Jim \"Are you ready for that party tomorrow night?\".\n\nThe feeling of the dream was different from all other dreams. In a dream you don't feel sick, hell you can barely remember a dream. This was no dream, it was a warning. \n\nI replied to Jim warning him not to go to the party. He laughed and said that I was tripping. I stayed home the next night. \n\nIn the morning, I texted Jim to see how the party was in the morning. I didn't hear a reply, I thought that he was just passed out and maybe forgot his phone so, I went over to his house. Knock Knock, his Mom answered saying that Jim spent the night spent the night at his friends house and that he hadn't come home yet.\n\nI went to the after scene of a wild party to begin the game of Where's Jim. He wasn't there, it was traffic hour so I decided to take the back roads back home. Jim was a responsible 18 year old, he wouldn't do anything too stupid.\n\nWhile driving down the back roads, I see a giant black roadblock up ahead. As I got closer, I realized that it wasn't a roadblock. Two cars had a head on collision, caught on fire and were nothing but a giant piece of charcoal now. That's when I notice the license plate, \"RAD-JIM\", it was Jim's. I called the police and they showed up sometime later. \n\nThe autopsy concluded that Jim was drunk and that the other vehicle had two people in it. One male in his 40's, one female child below the age of 10. I couldn't sleep for the next couple of days knowing that I had died and been given a second chance while Jim died and only got one chance. \n\nThat is how I became a spokesperson against drinking and driving. I swore an oath to never drink and drive. I realized how precious life was, how \"that's not going to happen to me\" can happen. I felt this second chance was my time to turn my life around.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1411362413","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckp33pa","link_id":"t3_2h36ac","name":"t1_ckp33pa","parent_id":"t3_2h36ac","retrieved_on":1426883127,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"sn44","body":"I was sitting by myself at the coffee shop when it all went down.  I almost didn't notice him at first.  To be honest I was in a bit of a funk having lost my job, girlfriend, and apartment all within the span of a week.  Luckily i was able to dig some spare change out from my buddy's couch to cover this last cup of coffee.\n\nAt first I just stared mindlessly out the window watching the world pass me by.  As the seconds ticked to minutes and the minutes ticked to hours I realized I hadn't moved since I first sat down.  Then my mind started to race. It was as if I was hyper aware of all my failures and shortcomings.  As my mind went dark I could no longer stomach looking at the world.  I just hung my head in shame and stared into the black abyss of my long cold coffee.\n\n\"You look like you could use a break,\" the stranger said as he took up a seat across from me.\n\nI grunted with a shrug.  I wasn't in the mood to talk.  Who was this guy anyway?  Can't he take a hint?  I looked up from my coffee long enough to size the guy up.  He was middle aged, had a salt-and-pepper scruff on his face.  His clothes were clean, but not pressed.  His jacket looked old, worn, maybe even a little ragged.  He seemed to look like how I felt.  Maybe this guy needed to talk as much as I did.\n\nWe sat wordlessly for a while.  I started to say something a few times but each time stopped myself.  I had no idea where to begin or even if this guy really cared.  Chances are he was just going to run some scam on me or spout some religious bull #BADWORDS# at me about how his god could fix everything.\n\n\"Look, I'm not going to sell you something. I'm not going to get all religious on you,\" he said.\n\nHis comment was a bit odd given my train of thought. Did I say that out loud? \n\n\"I'll be blunt.  I'm a bit tired.\" He took a moment to look out the window. \"I have something that might be of use to you.  It's served me well the last few, well, let's  just say years.\" He paused again.  \"I'm willing to pass it on to you since you look like you could use it.\"\n\nI started to ask but he cut me off.\n\n\"Use it carefully.\" He then slid a credit card across the table.  \"You'll figure out how it works pretty quick.\"\n\nI picked up the card and looked at it then up at him.  Before I could ask he pulled out a pistol, placed it to his temple and pulled the trigger.  Instinctively I shut my eyes and jumped back.\n\nThe next thing I know I was flat on my back on the floor.  What was left of my cup of coffee was covering my lap.\n\nThe restaurant was quiet and all eyes were on me.  I looked over at the table I was sitting at wondering why everyone wasn't looking at the body but there wasn't one.\n\n\"What the hell?\" I asked out loud.\n\n\"Hey, man, you okay?\" One of the employees asked.\n\nI looked around.  No body. No blood. No gun. Nothing.  Was it all a dream?  Did I doze off?\n\n\"Uh, yeah. Just spilled my coffee,\" I said with a sheepish look.\n\nI picked up the chair and sat back down.  I scolded myself for being an idiot and started blotting the coffee stains on my shirt and pants.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye I noticed a card on the table.  I picked it up.  Across the middle was a sixteen digit number much like a bank card would have but there was no logo or anything on it.  There was a name too.  As I tried to read the name it started to change.  If the change wasn't weird enough the fact that the new name on the card was mine was even weirder.\n\nA faint voice echoed in the back of my mind. \"You'll figure out how it works pretty quick.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1411409124","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckphvln","link_id":"t3_2h4hgm","name":"t1_ckphvln","parent_id":"t3_2h4hgm","retrieved_on":1426875833,"score":67,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":67}

As his anatomy adjusted to the brightness the vivid green glow of his sergeant's visor become clear, as well as the man's amplified voice. \n\n\"Come the battle awaits, brother,\" he boomed from the speakers within his grilled face-plate. Sirlum's superior gripped him by his pauldrons and heaved him upwards from the pile of masonry rubble he was blown into. Sirlum barely regained his sense of balance before a bulky, assault rifle was shoved against his metal chest. \n\n\"Fight for your brothers!\" the sergeant shouted as he shoved Sirlum and his armored exoskeleton forward. His first stumbling steps became stronger as his suit reserves began pumping stimulants and numbing chemicals into his wounded body. He was soon striding through the burning wreckage that was once the capitol of Eurasia and away from the shattered remains of his landing craft. Smashing through rubble and jumping craters caused by large ballistic explosions he moved towards the three blinking identifiers that were projected on the same screen as his live feed. Cross referencing this with the map of the city displayed in the top right of his vision Sirlum gauged the approximate location of his squad.\n\nAfter about a half a mile Sirlum charged through a final wall and burst into a courtyard of a grand mansion where three figures similar to Sirlum were scattered about in various forms of cover. Bullets cascaded from the opposite side of the courtyard deflecting off the exposed areas of the warriors armor. Occasionally the steel figures would expose themselves to deadly rain for a few moments to unleash a spray from their superior rifles. The slugs exploded flesh and stone alike as they detonated their ballistic center upon contact with either the architecture or an unaltered human.\n\nThis is what Sirlum was raised for. This is what his team was raised for. Fighting together. Different fingers on the same hand, they flowed harmoniously as one unit. Tactical perfection.

{"archived":false,"author":"Oscar_Geare","body":"Please excuse my google translate.\n\n-------------\n\n“*Zigarette*?”    \n“*Да, спасибо товарищу*.”\n \nThey were an odd couple to be found together in the middle of a war zone. They had met here many times since the Wehrmacht had come to city of Peter and Vladimir. Now they sat in a foreman’s office looking over the once great city, legs hanging out of the hole in the wall. Fritz chatted idly to his smoking friend who didn’t understand four words in five. Their rifles – one laminated plywood the other maple – sat up against the wall, ignored for the time being. There was a rule about lighting cigarettes with the same match, however both being the opposite’s sentry to the same sector they felt they had little to be concerned about. Their sectors were blissfully quiet this season, with the majority of the purge happening in other areas of the city.  \n \nBoris looked at the cigarette with appreciation. “*Турецкий*?” he asked.    \nFritz raised his eyebrow in question, not understanding the cryptic words coming out of the Russian’s mouth. Boris would be almost insulted if he could hear Fritz’s thoughts – he was Ukrainian, сука! The Red Army Sergeant struggled for the appropriate words to describe the former Ottoman Empire, before giving up and drawing a small map in the light layer of snow that had formed on the floorboards.    \nFritz chuckled and nodded, “*Да*.” Unlike the old, unshaven monster of a man that sat next to him the german had at least been attempting to learn a second language.\n \nBoris raised his eyebrows and nodded in appreciation, surprised at how well the Wehrmacht had it if this young Oberjäger could procure them. He chuckled slightly thinking back to the speeches on how the Bourgeois look down on the workers. Turkish cigarettes were an acquired taste. He didn’t know Fritz had never smoked in his life, but bartered away a pair of boots he had taken from a dead Russian to the *Quartiermeister* for access to the restricted commodity.\n \nPlacing the cigarette in his mouth, the Ukrainian got up and walked away from the edge of the building into the office, waving the young Bergen baker’s son to stay where he is. He had a surprise of his own. Rummaging in the satchel he brought with him, he pulled out a bundle of bandages – a tin of real coffee, padded and protected against the inactive mines, gre#BADWORDS#es and other weapons of war that Boris habitually carried with him.\n\n“*Kaffee? Echt Kaffee?*”    \n“*Да*.”\n\nThe lack of coffee was something that Fritz had complained about several times, and it had almost cost Boris an arm and a leg. Logically, two days rations would not be worth the 200g tin of caffeine, however the quiet they had in this factory and each other’s company was well worth it. They could both be dead tomorrow.\n\nFritz scooped up some snow and packed it into his metal cup-canteen as Boris brought out his well battered Swedish self-pressurising camp stove that he stole from the Fins during the winter war. Soon the small stove was roaring between them, powered only by the infinite supplies of the Third Reich. The rich aroma of roasted coffee floated across the devastated industrial area with nothing alive to rejoice in the forgotten scents that were once so common in the former capital of the Russian Empire.\n\nA loud clang of metal on metal broke their peace, and both soldiers scrambled into cover, Boris cursing as the hot coffee burnt his fingers and Fritz trying to douse the stove. There was supposed to be no movement by either armies in this sector. Boris grabbed Fritz’s rifle from the wall and tossed it over, still amazed at how light the Karabiner was compared to his own Mosin. Fritz caught the rifle lightly and pulled his binoculars out from his webbing and surveyed the ground below them. Boris, looking through the scope on his rifle saw the figure run from the Brickmaker’s Workshop at the same time as Fritz and they both relaxed a little.\n\n“*Zivilisten*” cursed Fritz, as Boris groaned: “*Гражданские*”\n\nBoris lowered his rifle and sat back down behind the wall, heart t#BADWORDS#. The civilians were mostly evacuated to safer sectors, or across Lake Ladoga. However some remained on the fronts, scavenging for whatever they could. He chuckled slightly and looked over at his brother-in-arms, just as the boy tensed up. Boris frowned slightly until he saw the look of horror on the German’s face and the Jaeger turn whiter than usual. He leaned out of cover, raising the scope to his good eye and felt his stomach drop.\n\nTwo men watched the young man run and stumble across the snow. Even at such a range, the Ukrainian Sniper could tell they were possibly the most handsome people he had ever seen – utterly at odds with the devastation and ruin that surrounded them. \n\nFritz ducked back behind the wall, dropping to his stomach and crawling out of the foreman’s office to where the radio was hidden. His comrade, unlikely in any other situation, but completely normal in this odd mess of a war that had occupied this ancient city, lowered himself behind the wall and checked the breech of his rifle, ensuring the glass rounds were still loaded.\n\n-------------\n\n^(For clarification, I thought it said 'something was set loose in the city of leningrad...' and just rolled with it. If you ignore the last two and a half paragraphs and some sentences it could still cover the prompt.

The suspect file showed an ugly dog in histrionics that stops moving the moment his owner barges into the room, the dog looks abashed.   The President clicked the ‘share’ icon below the file, but was upset there was not a Myspace option – he had directed the NSA to fix that a week ago.  Oh well.  He took a quick sip of his warming Red Stripe beer and continued browsing his favorite website.\n\nAbove his head, a spider dangled from a near invisible strand of webbing.  The spider seemed to be timing its descent producing its webbing methodically and climbing down towards the desk.\n\n“Yiss! There’s the one with me kicking down a door,” the President blurted and leaned back for a good laugh.  The spider resumed its descent.\n\nAfter a tear inducing laugh, Barack Obama returned his gaze back to his computer screen to find a brown, hairy, quarter sized spider on his computer monitor.  The spider’s eyes regarded the leader of the free world.\n\nA squeak emerged from the spider, “Hey buddy, you got any crackers?”\n\nThe president turned grey and leapt backwards from his chair with an *AIIIEEEEEEE*.  He tripped on the plush carpeting behind his desk and fell backwards.  His right temple smashed into the side of a putter that had been left astray earlier.  The president was dead.\n\nAnother spider sidled up to the assassin and lifted a leg to give him a slap on the thorax.  \n\n“Great work Bill.  Really appreciated the delivery.”\n\n“I didn’t even get to finish my joke,” the other spider said feigning disappointment.\n\nThe spiders scrambled away from the scene after the Secret Service agents broke into the room with pistols drawn.\n\n“POTUS is DOWN, POTUS is DOWN,” cried the agent into his wrist.\n\nThe two spiders crawled to a dark corner and resumed their congratulatory conversation.  A hush fell as a human fist sized tarantula approached slowly.\n\n“This is an excellent turn of events,” The Boss hissed.   “My contacts assure me that they will be able to frame the Russians.  Soon this pathetic species will destroy itself.”  The tarantula bounced with excitement.\n\nThe kingdom of spiders was finally unified.  Spiders had evolved from sporadic fear monsters to organized and intelligent world crushers.  Humans stood not a chance.\n\nThe Secret Service agent thought he heard a high pitched, barely audible *mwahaha, mwa, mwa, mwahahahaha*.

The room seemed colder, now, as my wispy visible breath could be seen by the light of the television set. My teammates were calling from the stereo, asking me why I was AFK. \n\nI ignored them. My world was this little girl now, and the pools of crimson on her face. She was crying red tears. And her mouth was moving, but no sound came from it. The sound seemed to come from everywhere at once.\n\n\"Daddy... Daddy... I want to be with you... Forever... Please...\"\n\nAt this point I was scared. There was frost on my glasses and I took them off. In that split second she was on my lap, her tiny hands on my cheeks. I stared into the red abyss that was her gaze and lost myself in it. There i saw... Death. My death. Countless times, in ways brutal and gentle the girl would kill me. \n\n\"Daddy... If you survive... Seven days... We'll be together forever...\"\n\nThe poor girl. The poor child. What choice did I have? I had one, actually. Despite what she was doing, i still had a bit of sanity left. I saw my gun at my feet. I reached for it and lifted it to her chin. \n\nBang. \n\nIt was easy, you know. She saw it coming but didn't move. I thought I'd have to report it, to get out and tell the police. I thought i'd just shot a child and feared for my freedom. Foolishly, I thought this was over. \n\nShe hopped to her feet and dusted off her skirt.\n\n\"Pfft. Mortals.

The acrid smell of sulphur and gunsmoke filled the air. I looked at the gun in my hand and realized something very troubling.\n\nI had a way out. I could die a free man.

{"archived":false,"author":"SenorStompy","body":"Mark dragged deep on the last of his cigarette.  The harsh smoke was a comforting feeling as it pulled down deep into his lungs.  Exhaling a blue wreath of smoke, he stubbed the filter into the overflowing ashtray.  Each filter stained with finger prints of blood, testament to the ragged condition of his fingers.  Turning his palms up Mark considered the damage he had wreaked on his hands, each finger split and cracked, some oozing yellow - weeping infection from his wounds.  He chuckled wryly a humorless cough of laughter at the bleakness of it all.  His hands the most obvious casualty of the hell he lived.  Looking up Mark saw a face staring back at him from the mirror ahead, gaunt with sunken eyes, days of ragged growth silvered well before its time.  He chuckled again, aged well beyond his thirty years, aged like an old man with his youth drained.\n\n \n\nMark let his eyes sweep across the room, filled with books stacked on sagging shelves.  Scuffed paperbacks cheek to jowl with cracked hardcovers, a life’s collection of other people’s stories, gold mixed with dross, classic beside pulp.  The room was frankly a mess, yellowed walls stained by one million cigarettes, each sucked down franticly, each a harsh scraping burst of relief.\n\n \n\nThere on the other side of the room it sat, the glass cabinet filled, tarnished trophies - Hugos, Nebulas, Best Sellers and more, a memorial to the words that spilled from these broken hands.  It was over though thought Mark, done, no more would he hunch clacking away, split fingers stabbing at those jagged keys, no more books, no more adulation, no more pain.\n\n \n\nMark reached again for the battered packet of cigarettes on the table and dragged out a pristine white cylinder.  Not marred yet with his fingers oozing grip.  Raising it to his mouth he struck a match and drew, pulling deep as the ember took.  Yes it was over, he would stay away, not sit in that high backed chair, wooden and uncomfortable hard beneath his legs.  Not sit before that dark oak desk.  That desk empty, swept clean of all, all that is except that construction of brass and iron, its name curled script across the face, ‘Corona’.  Keys yellowed ivory browned with age and marred with the ghost of Marks crimson fingertips.\n\n \n\nMark knew he must stay away, he would not let it start again, those days ensnared, trapped at that, desk fingers flying across clattering keys.  Slaves t o a will not his own, flying faster than he could ever have typed.  He almost hadn’t survived the last, each page the novel dragged out in one nightmarish week, one week trapped at that brooding desk watching words not his own march across paper, pouring out story page after page.\n\n \n\nNo, Mark knew he would stay away, not take those steps down the dusty hallway.  Not drag the chair back and sit, allowing another story to flow through him, taking of it his energy, sapping him even as it created.  With a start Mark realized he had smoked yet another cigarette to the filter.  Damned things would kill him.  #BADWORDS#ing it with its bloodstained kin Mark considered what to do now that he was free.  The world was his, he could go, do and be anything.  His mind was blank of ideas, all the freedom in the world and here he sat smoking cigarette after cigarette. \n\n \n\nOne small voice quiet and calm, spoke to Mark spoke in his own voice.  Wheedling in its question.  So reasonable, yet so wrong.  Mark scrubbed a hand across his face trying to scrub the voice from his ears.  The question came once more “Again?” it asked.  Such a simple question to ask.\n\n \n\nMark stood and took two steps before he knew, two steps towards the hall, that dusty walk, that door at the end.  Mark sighed as he stepped once, twice, three steps on the way.  Maybe one more, maybe one more time.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1411523266","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckquret","link_id":"t3_2h9yt5","name":"t1_ckquret","parent_id":"t3_2h9yt5","retrieved_on":1426852648,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Our unit hadn’t seen much combat and boredom was starting to show on everyone. I was secretly thankful that it had so far been a quiet war. I’d seen too many loud wars.\nMy thoughts were cut short by the croaking, guttural voice of Sarge.\n\n“Gentlemen, as you are aware Operation Ragnarok will commence in approximately 23 hours. I suggest getting off your asses and gearing up.”\n\nSarge was a father figure to us all. He had the tactical command of a General and the raw fighting spirit of a soldier. Everyone respected him- except maybe Foley. Foley was a tricky little #BADWORDS#. \n\n“You know Sarge, I think I’ll just stay here playing cards.”\n\n“You will go out there and you will fight Foley – that’s an order!” \n\n“No, no, no. You don’t see the big picture Sarge, you see war isn’t won by brute force. Operation Ragnarok is going to be a massacre for both sides. To win a war, one needs to be deceiving and deceptive. But that’s probably too hard for you to understand isn't it Sarge?”\n\n“You little coward! I've been in war since you were in diapers, I –“\n\nPercussion of gunfire echoed in the background. Bombs fell, screaming from the sky. \n\nOperation Ragnarok had started early.\n\nEveryone wanted to fight these days. Maybe it was the only thing we were good at. \nThe percussion of gunfire grew louder and the bombs were screaming closer. The concept of a large scale infantry battle remained similar to those battles fought in World War II, trenches were still widely used. But we had a hell more toys. A good, accurate drone strike could take out squadrons of men, automated turrets guarded trenches vigilantly with undying patience. We had nearly perfected the art of war. \n\nExplosions and gunfire melodiously blended with screams and howls of dying men. War was a morbid orchestra, its conductor Death. The glory and honor had long gone; it was just an onslaught of dying. Every day was the end of the world. \n\nIt was so cold.\n\nBlood stained the snow in red. I longed for a cigar to warm my frostbitten lips. The thought of my wife and daughter kept me warm for most nights but tonight was different. I could only accept the sobering fact that I was going to never see them again. Was I prepared to die? No. I wanted to get out of this frozen wasteland and embrace my wife and tell my daughter that everything was going to be okay. \n\nI caught a glimpse of Foley’s face. His arrogant smirk was wiped empty and replaced with a haunting emptiness. He was lying on the red snow. \n\nA FENRIR tank rose from the enemy trenches. The snarling of its engine trembled deep into the night. Rows of men were mowed down and I could only watch them die one by one. The mechanical beast prowled towards the Sarge. I would like to say that he faced certain death with honor and dignity but I can’t because he didn’t. He wasn’t a god. He was afraid. He died screaming, crushed under metal tyres. \n\nFire began to rain from the skies as the orchestra of war continued in its entire spectacle.  I trembled under its terrible majesty. Ethereal sounds of battle surrounded me as lightning streaked across the frozen sky.\n\nIt was so cold.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1411553890","downs":0,"edited":"1411554082","gilded":0,"id":"ckr3pf3","link_id":"t3_2h9rba","name":"t1_ckr3pf3","parent_id":"t3_2h9rba","retrieved_on":1426848335,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

He had no idea what was happening.\n\nTHere was no pin hidden in his throat or mouth. He could barely control his own muscles, and he could *feel* the chemicals running around his brain. He'd been drugged and dragged there, and he had no idea why.\n\nIt certainly hadn't been the FBI. That made no sense. Who then?\n\nHe struggled weakly, like any lesser man would have. He had nothing else, no man he could sway with careful verbal strikes. Hannibal was alone in the rain, and he could only wait.\n\nSomething moved, low in his field of vision.\n\nA sewer grate. There was something behind the grate, something colorful.\n\nThe face of a clown inched closer until it was pressed against the wet metal. Its red hair stuck out partly into the street.\n\nLecter swallowed his own scream before it sounded.\n\n*Do not show fear. Think!*\n\nThere was something wrong. The clown's face shifted an instant before its mouth, filled with *wrong* teeth, opened, and blood ran on it from the top of its head.\n\nThe face slid against the grate, back into the sewers. A drop of blood remained to remind Lecter that he hadn't dreamed. \n\nThe confusion intensified.\n\nBut already there was something else happening- a sound emanating from the building that loomed above the bloody grate. Like a revved engine, and then the sound sharpened, loudened: a chainsaw. \n\nA voice screamed louder than the chainsaw roared, and both sounds stopped. \n\nLecter started to blame the drugs in his body.\n\nIt got worse. \n\nA hand grabbed his shoulder. \n\n*He can hear me.*\n\n\"This setup leaves me curious. A purpose leads it all, surely-\"\n\nThe grip tightened, and a blade was slid beneath the hard mask. Lecter stopped talking.\n\n*Thuck.*\n\nJust as the knife started moving in a motion that strongly suggested he would die slowly of blood loss, the hand fell back. A body hit the next to Hannibal. It wore a long, white Halloween mask and a black hooded robe.\n\nThe knife was still wedged in the mask. He stuckout his lips and his tongue, manoeuvering the tool, caught it between his teeth, started hacking at the restraints-\n\nThe axe split his head in half. Peeking between the two halves of the dead face, another face whispered \"Here's Johnny...\"\n\nThe Thing, wearing Jack's body, then proceeded to wonder why it had gone through all the planning and preparing just to kill these five guys in this one particular way.

You're right, you know: mine's just too damaged to be used, at the moment. Damn repair shop can't make heads nor tails of it...\"\n\nDale, still glaring at the chart, growled to himself.

Since the first time the alien mothership made contact, all our contingency plans went out the window. We had no orders to follow.\"\n\n\"I understand this, General. My question is why there were even electric guitars brought on board the shuttle.\"\n\n\"I'm getting to that, sir. The aliens announced hostile intentions, and the Russians got uppity and shot a nuke at them. Damned Russians had secretly armed one of their satellites back in the eighties.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, the aliens were not affected by it, and that was when they sent their first envoy down to parley for our surrender. This time it was the Chinese that got worried and fired first and the entirety of the welcoming mission was wiped out by their superior alien weaponry. We learned then that the aliens had complete and total understanding and mastery of our military tactics and weapons technology, and they were not impressed.\"\n\n\"The guitars, General.\"\n\n\"Right, yes, the guitars. We managed to kill several of the enemy in our brief, lopsided battle, and upon dissection we discovered they had extremely sensitive and weak auditory organs. An overload could kill them. Hence why they wore protective suits at all times on our planet.\n\"Mr. President, it was crunch time and if we didn't think of something soon we'd all be slaves on board their mothership. We made the offer to have a final parley on the ISS, no weapons of any kind, we even offered to let them scan our shuttle. We realized as well that given their assumption that they had already won, and that they could vaporize us at will, that they would not be wearing suits. Neither would any of them on the mothership.\"\n\n\"But why were the guitars brought on board?\"\n\n\"That was Higgins, sir. Had the idea twenty minutes before blast off.\"\n\n\"And tell me, General, were you lead guitar? Vocals?\"\n\n\"Mr. President, I was percussion.\"\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n\"We rocked them to death.\"\n\n\"You rocked them to death?\"\n\n\"We rocked them to death in zero gravity, sir. I didn't think it would work, I just wanted to go out singing Black Sabbath, is all.\"\n\n\"So total victory, then?\"\n\n\"We commandeered the dead aliens speaker systems, sir, and broadcast Heavy and Death Metal to the entire mother ship. We heard screams for about twenty minutes and then complete silence. The mother ship remains in our orbit, sir, but we believe all life on it has perished.\"\n\n\"You are dismissed, General.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"Just one more thing, if you would.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"What was the song you played?\"\n\n\"Iron Man, sir.

{"archived":false,"author":"ffernback","body":"———,\n\nI'm very sorry about what happened. I know how excited you were about tonight, and how much you prepared for it. You were stood up, but that doesn't mean you can't still enjoy a nice dinner. When you told me you were returning, I scrambled to find a good restaurant that would deliver, which was not easy, the more so because I don't speak the language very well. I did find one, though. Everything has been paid for; I hope it's all very good. If the candles look unfamiliar, that's because they're new; I couldn't find any in the cupboards that I have already been in, and I didn't want to dig through your apartment, so I ran to that shop down the way, the one you sent me to during my first week here, and bought those two lilac candles. Thank you for having a table cloth the same colour as your favourite flower; it made things much easier. I used my own plates and cutlery because I didn't want to leave you with any dishes. I want to give you back your evening, as best as I can.\n\nI could tell you were crying at least a little bit when we spoke on the phone. Please don't take what happened too hard. It really doesn't say very much about you. What ever he thinks of you, I think you looked gorgeous, and if in the time we have spent together these past few months I have revealed nothing of my opinion of you, let me say that when we talk I could close my eyes and still be as moved by your beauty as I am when I have them open.\n\nI hope you aren't made uncomfortable by this, or find it inappropriate — the dinner or what I am saying here. That I think you might, that you probably will, is why this note is here instead of me. There is too much food for one person because at first I had planned to join you. I was going to take off your coat and bring you to your seat. At the table, we would talk like we usually do, because I have always found something charming in the two of us, but your dress, the candles, and the date you were lately denied, all new airs, would hang over us and possibly become my first hint towards you. I say I had planned to join you, but even then, I knew that I wouldn't stay. I set my place and combed my hair, though, because I thought that it might mean I was, at the least, trying to go through with it. This was a struggle of my mind, however, and so they were empty efforts. Leaving as soon as the table was set would have given me precious more minutes to write this. More than that, I don't think I could have given you a hint. I only intended to write the first paragraph of this note, but I found I needed to tell you how I feel, and that is something I simply can't do in person, especially not when, as I have said, your reciprocation seems no more than a wonderful fantasy to me. If you never want to see me again, I understand. I have left my key to your apartment at the foot of one of the candles. You can throw my things in the trash, or leave them in the hall.\n\n———: We're never completely ourselves until we're alone. I'm alone when I'm with you. If you feel the same way, please knock on my door.\n\n\n— Fixthe","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1411706585","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cksuvwz","link_id":"t3_2hhern","name":"t1_cksuvwz","parent_id":"t3_2hhern","retrieved_on":1426817743,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

They were all known for scientific progress, after all.\"\n\nBrennen, our senior intern, chuckled. \"The Atlantians, huh? Yeah, definitely explains why they're gone.\" Nobody looked at him. He didn't understand the enormity of what we'd uncovered.\n\nIn front of us, on a sparkling clean surgery table, was a brick of obsidian. Etched into its sides were symbols indicating numeric sequences, but without direction. Any way you read it, it was a logically sound mathematical equation, and infinite; stored on its shining surface were all the maths that man could ever dream up, an infinitely complex chain of infinite sequences. It was dubbed the Thoth Stone.\n\nIt was so much more than an interesting find. With it, you could change the math of the universe, given a powerful enough input. You could account for unprecedented variables, just by looking farther into the sequence. At no point would anything be a surprise; the Thoth Stone had all of the answers. \n\nOtis cleared his throat. \"We cannot use this, ever. Given a supercomputer of some kind, or something else as incomprehensible as this stone, we have the very real possibility of undoing the fabric of existence. We will not only extinct ourselves, our species, our planet; we will destroy the possibility of life in the universe.\" The rest of us nodded, dumbly. It was a little above anyone's paygrade. \n\nCelia, a theoretical physicist from CERN, lifted hair away from her eyes and behind her ear. \"We're going to need a kiln in here capable of reaching 1650 Celsius.\" Brennen raised an eyebrow. \"That's the melting point of Obsidian, Brennen. There's no other choice.\" \n\nBrennen shrugged, and Otis spoke quietly into his radio set. \"Command, I need an oven, or a kiln. We have some strange residues identified near the site, and I'm afraid...\" He turned his back to us. We were used to this sort of gaming with military powers. None of it was taboo.\n\nWe waited for a moment, and Otis came back, smiling. \"All taken care of. Soon, this will be a lost piece of human history, and we can all rest easy.\"\n\nA gunshot echoed.

I stretched my arms above my head and let out a booming yawn.  Slowly, I sat up and took in the new world around me.\n\nClear meadows and forests stretched through a great expanse of the World.  Sunlight burned away the mists of dawn, forcing them to retreat from the encroaching light.  I smiled and took in a deep, crisp breath of what felt like the cool Spring air.  I exhaled and accidentally blew the leaves from thousands of trees.  I smiled sheepishly and prodded at some of the trees that still stood.  they were alive but would need to grow new buds.  Ah, how I loved the waking world.\n\nI rose from my bed in the earth and stood tall and proud to the rising sun.  What a wonderful day for a walk; perhaps south today.  I've always enjoyed walking south.  Somehow, it feels like walking down hill.  But today, something was not quite right.  I had an itch on my shoulders.  Persistent and biting.  Not enough to hurt but enough to distract and ruin the pleasure of the morning.  I reached to scratch just behind the neck and I heard it.\n\nThe screams of thousands of...humans.\n\nI pulled my fingers away and shuddered.  Disgusting.  I had caught humanity while I was asleep.  I could feel them everywhere, crawling all over me and using my flesh for their food, laying their children and defecating in between my hair, using it as their homes.\n\nI started running towards the nearest ocean.  I caught my foot on the peaks of several mountains and fell face first into the earth.\n\n\"Get off me!\" a voice grumbled.\n\n\"Pax, is that you? Pax, help! I've, I've got humans!\"\n\nThe ground below me shook as Pax emerged from his bed.  \"Then definitely get off me! I don't want your filth!\"\n\n\"Pax, you had humans, how do I get rid of them!  Please, they itch!\"\n\nPax stood and backed away, shaking off desert sand.  \"Just go dive in the ocean and don't you come back this way until you're good and free of them!\"\n\nI quickened my pace and dove head first into the ocean, furiously scrubbing every inch of my body to rid myself of the humans.  I could hear them screaming and watched as their little structures floated away from me.  There was something soothing about being able to see the filth remove itself from my body.\n\nI scrubbed until my skin was sore and looked around the ocean, wading in the corpse of their entire, disgusting civilization.  What a terrible way to start the day.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412026292","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckvxgs6","link_id":"t3_2hti3f","name":"t1_ckvxgs6","parent_id":"t1_ckvvyr8","retrieved_on":1426763653,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":10}
{"archived":false,"author":"Aegeus","body":"I'm not the Heir.\n\nSomeone thought I was the Heir.  Abbadon's Knights burned down my village and killed my parents because they had heard a rumor that the long-lost Heir of Mithras was found there.  He's burned down hundreds of villages on even flimsier pretexts.  I was just the first one who could fight back.\n\nI’ve been to the Place of Kings, where the stones lit up at my touch, just as the legend said they would shine at the hand of the rightful king.  But I don’t believe that legend.  Mithras the First wasn’t king of anything, but it still lit up for him, didn’t it?  And Abbadon claims that he made the stones shine as well, even though he took the throne over a mountain of corpses.  Probably it lights up for anyone with magical potential, but nobody else dared to test it.  Nobody except a foolish girl who didn’t realize what it would mean if the Usurper suspected the Heir was hiding in her village.\n\nMy advisor is Darik, the king’s former vizier.  He turned out to be an old man living in the house next door.  He kept me safe when the Knights came, and taught me swordplay and sorcery.  He knows I’m not the Heir, but he follows me anyway.  He said that it was his duty to support the Heir in all things, and right now, that means helping me topple Abbadon.  With his help, we’ve built The Resistance, the army that the Heir will need when he returns.\n\nI wield Dawnbringer, the Sword of Kings, which I recovered from the Darkbarrow Caverns.  The Knights were planning to claim it for Abbadon, and even the Heir wouldn’t be able to retrieve it from the royal vaults.  So we raced there, and just barely retrieved it before the entire army came down on us.  I’ve been keeping it safe ever since.  In the hands of the rightful king, the mere sight of it could send enemies fleeing and rally a routed army.  In my hands, we haven’t had any stunning victories yet, but it’s still a fine sword and a fine symbol for the Resistance.\n\nNow, it’s time for our masterstroke.  We raided the Royal Archives and found Mithras’s notes on the Radiant Annihilator, a devastating sorcery that supposedly only his descendants can use.  But again, I think the legends aren’t quite true.  Spells work for anyone, if you have the power and knowledge you need.  With these notes, Darik’s advice, and Dawnbringer as a focus, I could cast it.  And with that sort of firepower, the Resistance could take the fight to Abbadon.  We could storm the Sunlit Palace itself, and bring down the usurper once and for all.\n\nWe’re almost ready, but I’m still wondering about one thing.  If I do all that, what’s left for the rightful heir to do?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412031922","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckw089p","link_id":"t3_2hralt","name":"t1_ckw089p","parent_id":"t3_2hralt","retrieved_on":1426762329,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"Mazon_Del","body":"Reluctantly I groan as I wake up, always hating having spent my night on Reddit till 3 in the morning, only to wake up at 6 to get to work on time. Only this time something wasn't quite right. My room was cold like I liked it, but my mattress was too comfortable. I looked around and blinked in surprise to see several bunk beds in the dark room. \"What the hell?\" I ask in confusion, causing others to stir and sit up, groaning and muttering themselves. This was most certainly not my apartment!\n\nI reached over and pressed my hand against my wall out of instinct, looking for my light switch. By luck or coincidence there happened to be a switch on the wall for this purpose. The sudden light caused us all to groan in hatred before looking at each other su#BADWORDS#iously. After a few moments of glancing around at each other and noting that familiar scar above our foreheads \"Ah. Damn.\" most of us mutter.\n\nWe climbed out of our beds and didn't quite bother to chat, we all had the same thoughts, churning through the same logic trees and assumptions. One of me reached the door and glanced back at the others and we all wondered if this might be some trap of a sort and he just shrugged at the silent shared thought \"Well, good luck if it is.\" he says and opened the door to walk through. Nothing happened and he gestured for us to follow.\n\nWe did a bit of exploring, not that there was much of it to do really. Bunk room, kitchen, bathroom, living room, and only one door out. Locked of course. In the living room there was a note. One of us picked it up glanced at it for a moment and put on our oration voice, dripping with melodramatic tones, shifting in and out of various accents as fit the mood. A few of us chuckled at the literal self referencing humor as we listened.\n\nHonestly it was a fairly expected outcome, fourteen of us, one door. Only one can leave, it must be the original. We looked at each other and the one with the note shrugged \"Alright then. Standard setup really. I presume we all remember the Cracked article on this?\" he asked and of course we all nodded. Without a word we began to split into pairs, and a great orgy commenced. Everyone took all the roles and an interesting and pleasurable time was had.\n\nWe sat back for a bit and eventually went over to the kitchen for some food and drink. We filled our bellies and relaxed for a good bit having accomplished the first objective we had long ago before this event decided upon. Sexual intercourse with ones self. A normally unlikely situation. Much better than #BADWORDS#, though admittedly a little disturbing.\n\nAfter some more rest we all got up and stretched a bit, helping each other out before spreading out through the house, those that reached certain areas claiming them for themselves. Soon we were fairly evenly distributed. \"Everybody ready?!\" one called out and after various replies in the positive someone else shouted \"GO!\" And battle commenced.\n\nIt is an interesting thing to fight oneself. You knew what you might do to any given attack, but reaction times and the speed of events led towards fairly unpredictable situations occurring. Those in the kitchen had gone for the knives and teamed up, working their way to the main area, waving the blades around clearly imagining them to simply be short swords. In the bathroom a loud clanking could be heard as the toilet lid was used to cave in a skull. The Alliance of the Kitchen as I decided to name it was ended as the three of me from the bunk area ran out with a roar utilizing short staffs made from broken bed posts.\n\nBlood was everywhere and the interior had been torn asunder in all manner of ways, but finally there were but two of us and combat ceased. Oh sure the combat could have ended with just one, but by convention once it was down to two relatively equal combatants things stopped. We each smirked and gave a comical bow and began moving the bodies of our other selves over to the bunk room and assembled something resembling a pile of clean cushions to rest on. \"Well that was fun.\" one of us stated, the other nodded his agreement.\n\nAnother item checked off the list. We now knew how we'd do in a fight to the death. After another meal, the last meal, we sat at opposite points of the living room, each with two knives and a glass of water in front of us and a rather large cleaver in the middle of the room on the remains of the shattered coffee table. And now, for the battle of wills. We stare at each other for a few moments and one begins. \"Hoffman Frenchman?\" he states. After a few moments the other declares \"Hoffman.\" The other smiles and nods \"Hoffman.\" and holds up one finger. The other smiles \"Hoffman Frenchman?\". The other impulsively declares \"Frenchman.\" and with a smirk the asker replies \"Hoffman.\"\n\nWith a muttered curse the other held up a second finger. No accusations of cheating appeared, none were necessary. Hoffman Frenchman is the game of kings. One can trivially cheat at it, but to do so sullies ones honor, even if only to themselves. And so it continued on, a full battle of the mind. Searching for patterns, counter patterns, traps, and hints. And so the war raged calmly and without despair. Things went quite well for me. I had managed to reach 20/50 victories. And I had also reached 26 out of 50 victories. With a smile both of us nodded to each other. The loser drank his water, savoring it for a moment before gently placing the glass down amidst the destruction of the living room.\n\nThe other calmly stood, leaving his blades behind before retrieving the cleaver as the other knelt and took one of his knives. The cleaver holder stood to the side and said \"Take all the time you need.\" and I calmly and respectfully stood there. The knife holder smiled and nodded, closing my eyes for a few moments, enjoying the peace of the room. Suddenly I lashed out, stabbing myself in the gut with the blade and wriggling it around for a few moments before leaning forward. I was swift and strong with the cleaver, decapitating myself in one blow. For a moment things were quite dizzy as I rolled across the floor. I picked my head up and looked into my eyes. \"And now we've committed seppuku.\" My head smirked in clear amu#BADWORDS#t before slowly fading out lifelessly.\n\nRespectfully I placed my head down next to my body and arranged the body neatly. I had been an honorable warrior this day and deserved at least that much consideration from myself. Finally with my duties done, I left my weapons behind, brushed some debris off of myself and walked up to the locked door. I looked up at the camera that was clearly above it and stated \"Trick question. We all had the same experiences, the same mind, the same thoughts. A body is just a vehicle. We are all the original. Open up.\"\n\nThe lock snicked open.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412061614","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckwcme3","link_id":"t3_2huuz4","name":"t1_ckwcme3","parent_id":"t3_2huuz4","retrieved_on":1426756457,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

It had become a regular ritual for her, as soon as she'd start feeling better, she'd get visitors.  This time she wasn't going to be passive, she was alert and paying attention.  She'd palmed her meds this morning so she was feeling a little sicker than usual, but definitely more alert.\n\nThe doctor opened the door with a flourish as if presenting something to his guest.  In walked the Starlet, wearing painted on Jeans and an leather jacket festooned with rhinestones and a low cut blouse.  She didn't dress up for Wendy's sake, that was for sure.  \n\n\"HAAAAAeeey sweetness! How are you doing today?\" Big smile, from ear to ear, staring right into Wendy's eyes.  She approached.\n\n\"Fine, I guess, all things considered\"\n\n\"I know darling.. you're so brave.. so brave.   I can't imagine what it must be like to be stuck in here all the time. The doctor said you've been doing better though, is that true?\" She seemed to ask almost eagerly.\n\n\"Yeah, my numbers are a bit better, I seem to be responding well to treatments.\"\n\n\"Ohh.. ohh!\" She closed her hands around Wendy's and shut her eyes and tilted her face upward \"I can tell that's true, Wendy.. I can feel it\".\n\nHer eyes snapped open, so, tell me something about yourself, what are your hopes and dreams?  I want to know how you're going to be more famous than I am when you get out of here. \n\nWendy knew the game and she wouldn't stop until they sang a song together, or connected over the memory of a loved one or she read her poetry.  It was always something.  This time Wendy had a plan to try.\n\n\"I want to be a writer\"\n\n\"Oooh! Cool!  I love um... books and stuff.  My latest movie is based off a book I think! Although I think we changed it a bit but tell me about it!\"\n\n\"well, you see, my book is about Vampires\"\n\n\"AWESOME! I love vampires!  My friend Brad was in a movie about Vampires and he was so sexy in it... maybe I should introduce you to him! Would you like that?\"\n\n\"Umm.. sure, well you see these aren't normal vampires, they don't drink blood, they drink life itself.\"\n\n\"haha.. uh, what?  That's not a vampire babe, that sounds weird.  I think you should stick with what works\".  She had let go of her hands now and was staring back at Wendy.\n\n\"Oh, well you see, these Vampires soak up the life from people but it's too obvious to do it to healthy people so they go out of the way to places where there's famine, disease, old folks' homes. Even hospitals.  You know, where people are expected to be weak and die, so they don't raise su#BADWORDS#ion\"\n\nThe Starlet stood up and stared down at her.  She wasn't smiling anymore.  \"I think I've tired you out, I need to go.  Goodbye Wendy, I hope to see you again.\" And with that she walked out the door and was gone.\n\nWendy sat silently for a moment.  She definitely felt worse.  Was it the meds?  Or was her theory correct?  If so, she now knew why all the celebrities came to see them, why so many went to Africa or disaster areas.  They weren't helping, they were feeding.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412107307","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckwt5o3","link_id":"t3_2hw3aq","name":"t1_ckwt5o3","parent_id":"t3_2hw3aq","retrieved_on":1426748550,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

{"archived":false,"author":"dustydust23","body":"Work that day was exhausting. Three members of the assembly line had called in sick so I was working alongside my boss all day. This guy hadn't seen the line in forever and I spent all shift fixing mistakes the mistakes he made. I knew he wouldn't be cracking the whip any less when he's back in his office either, it was to be the same ol' unachievable bar. It didn't matter whether or not he could handle the superhuman workload himself, the working peasants would continue at their murderous pace.\n\nIt would be quite the understatement to say I was excited to leave work that Monday, it was time to go home, grab an ice cold brew, and put my feet in a deservingly horizontal position. The drive back to my house was awful too, when I get off late I usually take a shortcut but that day I was too tired to think properly, so I ended up on the highway with all the other losers.\n\nAt last I was at home, I had a quick shower, changed my clothes and went down to the fridge to grab some liquid refreshment. I stopped short. There on the counter, right by the stove, was a key. The key had a note under it with \"The Key To Your Future\" written in  crayon using big, scraggly, uneven letters. This was very odd, I thought. I looked around at all my valuables, they were still there, I surged it off, I had no way of knowing why this key was here.\n\nI attached the loose key to my keychain and sat down to an evening with the tube. I loafed there there all night, lost in sports and cheesy sitcoms until just after midnight, then went straight to bed.\n\nI had a strange dream that night. I was holding the key to the secrets of the universe, to the future. Every door I wanted opened would instantly open with the shiny piece of metal I took from my pocket. No one could hold me back, doors in space, doors in my mind, opening these doors were just a twist of my wrist away.\n\nWaking up, I knew that key had a purpose, and I would find out what that was by the end of the day. I then realized it was the exact same type of key we used at work, maybe it was the key to my future office. Was I getting a promotion?\n\nI rushed through my morning routine and then to work. Arriving, there was an air that things would be different, that this would be my last day on the line. Someone was going to come down from upstairs and bring me up with them when they went back.\n\nI waited all day but no one came down. I decided I would try the doors myself. The line was running late today, like always, and everyone upstairs would be gone.\n\nI creeped up after work and tried a door hesitantly... Nothing. I looked around and tried another... Still nothing. I scrambled around like a madman, I had this image in my head, I was going to be able to open a door! I had tried all of them... Still nothing. It was time to go home. Frustrated as all hell, I wheeled the key off my keychain and threw it in the trash. That was no key to the future. Maybe it was in children's writing because it was nothing but a childish dream.\n\nI left just as the line supervisor was locking up, he didn't even ask me what I had been doing upstairs. I got in my car and tried to erase the day's disappointments. It only donned on me, right at the end, when I saw a shinny new brass nob on my front door; my landlord said he would be in and out of the house this week. That key was the key to my future, my future front door.\n\n\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412183932","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckxlt2h","link_id":"t3_2hzl0q","name":"t1_ckxlt2h","parent_id":"t3_2hzl0q","retrieved_on":1426734741,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

{"archived":false,"author":"sixs#BADWORDS#at","body":"We stumbled through the mouth of the cave, my torch held aloft as its glowing flame licked the ceiling stalac#BADWORDS#es and dared to drop embers upon my companion's deerstalker.  \"Hold still, Watson!\" cried Holmes, as he dropped to his knees and produced his magnifying glass. He knelt , examining some minute white substance powdered upon the bottom of the cave walls near the footpaths - quite indistinguishable from the surroundings, and easily missed by those without as keen an eye or mind as Sherlock Holmes.  \"Look here, Watson,\" said Holmes, and I brought my head closer to the glass.  \"Guano?\" I wondered aloud. Holmes touched a finger to the white substance, and brought it to his tongue. \"Cocaine,\" he said.  My word, what would cocaine be doing inside a cave?\n\nMy mind wandered as to the events that brought us to this dreadful place.  We were enjoying afternoon tea in 221B Baker St, when Holmes quickly stood up and declared \"Watson, please ask Mrs. Hudson for another teacup - we are about to have visitors.\" As uncannily as ever, a knock was heard at the door.  \"Come in,\" said Holmes, and the familiar form of Inspector Lestrade entered our flat.  Holmes was typically dismissive of the Inspector, but Lestrade's countenance was one of deep concern and puzzlement, which seemed to delight Holmes.  His usual air of disdain was immediately dispelled with the thought of a truly intriguing mystery.\n\nLestrade went on to explain that a rash of odd murders had been plaguing the seedier side of London in the past week.  Some rather unsavory individuals - drug dealers, who dealt primarily in the acquisition and distribution of cocaine and heroin - had been turning up beaten to a pulp of late, with a few dying from their truly horrible wounds.  Lestrade had explained that both he and the members of Scotland Yard believed he had beaten these men with a pole or other hand-held weapon - a truly considerable feat since these men were typically armed with revolvers and knives and shot-guns.  With a dismissive air, Holmes dove directly into the data collected by the police.  \n\nAfter a glance at the crime photographs, Holmes launched himself into his usual flurry of what seemed like speculation that was, in reality, anything but: \"Our would-be vigilante is a man, six-foot-two in height, approximately thirteen stone weight, and is an expert in the fluid hand-and-foot fighting styles of the Orient. He uses gadgetry and theatrics to disguise his appearance and to instill fear into his quarry - primarily to frighten the offenders into curbing their criminal activities, but failing that, his skills are more than ample to inflict the wounds you see before you.\" Lestrade asked \"Well, what about his weapon? I mean, if I were going toe to toe with this lot -\" here, Lestrade indicated the drug dealers - \"I'd want a gun or two of my own, or perhaps a knife...\" Holmes sighed loudly, clearly annoyed at the Inspector.  \"Were you not listening, Lestrade?  He carries no weapon because he *is* a weapon.  His fighting skills, hard earned from a life of manic dedication and study are all the weapon this man will ever need. Furthermore, this man is meticulous, studying the mannerisms and patterns of his quarry so that he can strike with the most force and with the least public disturbance possible.  He is overwhelmingly adept and most certainly lethal.  I would advise the Yard to abandon the search for this man as it will likely only end with your officers suffering a similar fate. Instead, I would focus your efforts on informing the criminal underworld to be on their guard even more than usual - there is a new hunter in London, one who does not suffer crime in this city, and no patience for the mechanisms of the law.\"  I detected a  measure of admiration in my companion's voice upon this declaration, and wondered if this was the path that Holmes might have followed, were his path to take a different course. \"Leave this to me, Lestrade - I shall deal with this vigilante, and you shall be duly informed when this threat is neutralized.\"  Lestrade and his retinue left the flat, after which Holmes was positively giddy at the prospect of an interesting case.\n\nThrough our investigation, we learned that the criminal underworld of London had become increasingly concerned about this assailant, who uses the pretense that he is a Vampire Bat creature to frighten criminals into submission - and I daresay he was quite successful.  The fear written on the faces of those we interviewed was apparent.  Holmes was almost envious.\n\nThe lead that finally lead us to the abandoned cave adjoining the grounds surrounding the abandoned Wayne Manor was that of a cocaine shipment that had docked on the Thames.  The Bat-Man cast a frightening shadow upon the docked vessel that was attempting to offload its freight of narcotics, when the vigilante descended upon them and gave them all a good thrashing.  Seven more than able-bodied criminals, all of whom having a long history of enforcement and more than ample physical prowess lay strewn about as so much chattel.  This was truly more than a man.  Holmes exclaimed \"Watson, the game's afoot!\" when he detected a partial footprint of cocaine residue, and we followed this trail for miles until it disappeared outside a waterfall-hidden cave.\n\nAs Holmes and I examined the cave, he directed me to extinguish my torch and ready my revolver.  While Holmes and I were no stranger to fisticuffs, I daresay I registered more than a trifle of trepidation upon the prospect of a physical duel with such a specimen.  Was this a man, or was this a monster?  I wasn't sure, given what I had been witness to.  \"Holmes, what if we cannot overcome this foe?  Whatever shall we do?\"\n\nWith a grim look in his eye, Holmes turned to me and said \"Elementary, my dear Watson.  We kill the Bat-Man.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412189084","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"ckxom3d","link_id":"t3_2hz6l0","name":"t1_ckxom3d","parent_id":"t3_2hz6l0","retrieved_on":1426733431,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Haikus will have to sate you, Chromeboy, she thought, mentally patting herself on the back for her well-computed puns as a tinny and disgustingly enthusiastic Virtual Intelligence penciled her in for 3300:00 EJUS time. “Oh, I do hope you have a marvelously perfect da-” trilled the exhaustingly chipper VI before 837 hastily cut transmission. \n\n“OK, Google: transcribe to e-message. Recipient: JKP-42-80007” she said aloud. Her holo did just that after confirming which account (“JUIS Ganymede shipboard account or personal holo?” “The former, Google.”), and she began to dictate. “I was going to write you a sonnet but that will take me quite a while since constructing a poem while meticulously maintaining that specific rhythm is throwing me off and I got rained on like a #BADWORDS# in the organics’ Dome today. Maybe I’ll get that sonnet to you on your Rollout in OE:November. I hope deep space is exciting. I think you told me you would be passing through the Horsehead Nebula around this time—I can’t wait to see the displays when you get back. In the meantime, a haiku:\n\n**Time inches slowly\nWhere in space are you, darling?\nCome back to me, punk.**\n\nNow, a story: a Monk™ unit from a new batch tried to convert me yes#BADWORDS#ay. Started off telling me to embrace #BADWORDS#an and everything—you know, the usual #BADWORDS#—so of course I couldn’t help but egg it on. I felt like such a total virus! It was really smoothly designed though, likely equipped with next-gen VI because it was being kind of a smartass. Usually I can get them to crash pretty quickly but this one took almost the whole day. Oddly, for a good while it seemed Artificial before I exhausted its bank of programmed responses! More oddly (but not necessarily less sinister) it looked like it was made of high-grade iron alloys like most military/industrial service bots, but I suspect it’s just wearing a spectacularly convincing Exo. I wish I knew the factory, I remember you telling me that different factories crank out different bot designs. Is that meant to throw me off? I could see it working if they weren’t so blatantly obvious—I never would have pegged it as a Monk™ before it opened its mouth. Maybe it’s meant to fool organics or old-gen mechs or something. Corporate theology is so #BADWORDS# weird, babe. I captured a display to show you when you’re back, since you’re pretty good at distinguishing between bots (and it is actually really cool looking. Almost as cool as the Martian sentinel you showed me, and that’s saying a lot). \n\nAnother haiku:\n\n**I miss your chrome face\nYou’re way too far from me now\nYou got dat ass doe**\n\nLife update: I’m going in for heat sink repair today; my processor feels like it’s about to fry. I think it’s from all the fuel cells I knocked back recently when I went out with JRT-255 (she was celebrating her fresh AcuVision© implants, the new ones with improved VI and a less #BADWORDS# interface) and DF-387 (celebrating a less intense workload). I actually had to restore to factory settings and re-download myself again the next day, that’s how #BADWORDS# up I was. I don’t know how you’ve done it so many times, this one time was such a bug for me! Not to mention BioWare’s VI slowly wears my wire coatings every time I have to make any kind of appointment with them. I can hear the exclamation points at the end of every sentence it squeaks out. Sooo grating.\n\nYet another haiku:\n\n**Ganymede Sailor-\nI hope deep space is lovely.\nMy steel longs for yours.**\n\nJ80007P, it still astounds me how powerful your absence is. I’ve only ever thought organics could feel this way. I miss the feeling of your synthetic Exo on my bronze-plated metal, the depth of your orbital implants as our gazes lock when I’m embedded in the cold comfort of your arms, the delightful scratch of your wiring when you shed your synth-skin and our forms entwine. I crave the instant rush when your hardware enters mine. I long for your touch, the sound of your voice. You being gone for a month in our own star system is bad enough; I can’t imagine when you’re off on your intergalactic tour. I miss you so much. \n\nI have to go in a few (appointment at 3300:00, my time) but I’ll message you again when I have the chance. I look forward to hearing from you. Power up, baby.”\n\n837 leaned back and adjusted to scroll through the message to ensure correct transcription (it all looked solid) and she sat, melancholy, and passionately commanded “Google: send.” She wondered, as she stretched her rusty limbs and felt her wiring pull taut, whether in an alternate universe (or even among the quillions of mechs and organics throughout the stars) she had an alternate self who was feeling the same deliciously cold feelings for an alternate JKP. She sighed another long, mechanical sigh, and abruptly felt her processor heating up dangerously. “Oh, *#BADWORDS#*. OK Google: call me a transport pod. Get me to the nearest BioWare factory.”\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412211308","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cky0021","link_id":"t3_2i03te","name":"t1_cky0021","parent_id":"t3_2i03te","retrieved_on":1426727941,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

This entire area is swarming with enemies and high-caliber weaponry.\"\n\n\nBob looks at the map for a moment, and then points to a nearby structure. \"Put an RPG round through that wall.\" And that was all he said. I shrugged -he hasn't been wrong yet- and pulled out my RPG launcher. The round hit exactly where aimed, causing the building to collapse, which in turn caused an even larger explosion, coupled with a large amount of black smoke. I yelled, \"GASMASKS!\", and everybody quickly donned their masks. I then realized that we had a straight shot to our objective.\n\n\nOnly three blocks from the Capitol building, and nothing was going to stop us.\n\n\nEver since control of the country was seized, this entire city has become a warzone. The military was forced to either serve the new regime or surrender their weapons. Those of us who didn't were labeled as criminals.\n\n\nSo, as it turns out...yeah. We are the bad guys.\n\n\nAnd I kinda like it.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nEverything freezes as Bob hits the pause button on his controller.

So, I knew I couldn't go back to my sleephome. Leaving in the middle of the shift means my residence would be discontinued, along with my food allowance.\"\n\n\"Stephen, this is the acceptable result of abandoning your daily task. This in itself can be construed as a mental disturbance worthy of review. You would have been well cared for in the re-education facility until you were capable of returning to labor.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, shoved into a city block sized room filled with hundreds of invalids and insane people, constantly bombarded by blaring loops of the Seven Truths until I was so desperate to get away that I'd agree to go back to meaningless and repe#BADWORDS#ve boxmaking...\"\n\n\"Citizen Stephen, the Seven Truths are the distillation of all wisdom, created to ensure your contentment and productivity. They are not a...\" he paused as he dredged up the next word from the depths of conditioned memory: \"punishment.\"\n\n\"Seeker, knowing what I know now, I can see that our entire culture is a punishment.\"\n\n\"And this building showed you this knowledge?\"\n\n\"You can't imagine what I found in there! All along the walls were shelves of these bound up collections of paper sheets. And there were words on them! More words than I even knew existed!\"\n\n\"And this is where you were infected with these depreciated wordforms?\"\n\n\"Well, not at first...\"\n\n\"Yes, the records indicate you were absent for several months. How did you survive without food?\"\n\n\"Well, there was plenty of food around in the forest, and plenty of books that showed me how to find it. It was a little tough until I figured out the filing system, but then I found everything I needed to dig up roots, and which berries were poisonous, and how to set traps.\"\n\n\"Traps?\"\n\n\"For animals.\"\n\n\"Whatever for? Were you threatened?\"\n\n\"No, for food.\"\n\nAt this point, the Seeker's face screws up into a look of sheer repugnance. \n\n\"You... actually ate the flesh of animals?\"\n\n\"Damn right, and some of them were pretty tasty roasted over a fire.\"\n\nThe Seeker's skin takes on a paler sheen as nausea threatens to overwhelm him. \n\n\"So many of these wordforms had been excised, how did you even understand  them enough to follow these unpleasant instructions?\"\n\n\"Simple, Seeker, they also have a collection of pages that describes wordforms. It is called a 'dictionary'. Also, those collections are called 'books'.\"\n\n\"What an unnecessary label. And yet, of all of these acts you describe, the depths of your illness is still not apparent. The symptoms you display could not simply be the result of these wordforms.\"\n\n\"Seeker, they have an entire section dedicated to a concept called 'Philosophy'. It is the study of thinking. How we think, why we think, and what motivates us. Once I discovered this collection I felt like a man who had no idea he was drowning until someone finally throws him a safety line. I spent weeks digging through books by Kant, Aquinas, Kierkegaard and Russell. I learned the wordforms for 'Human Dignity',  'Morality', and 'Free Will'.\n\nAt this point Stephen's  face takes on a look of far-away peace, something absent the entire time he has spent in this room.\n\n\"I learned that the Seven Truths are not wisdom, they are shackles. I began to realize that Consensus had created them as a mechanism to inhibit... something... something we have forgotten.\"\n\nSeeker Szahn's piercing eyes focus on Stephen's face, his voice taking on a hint of indignation. \n\n\"Citizen Stephen. Would you like to witness the... brutality of ages past? To understand the true price that is contained within the excised wordforms? Can you bear to witness what suffering is?!\" Szahn rumbled as the walls shifted and altered to terrible scenes of slaughter and carnage from wars long forgotten. \n\n\"Stephen. See now the result of wordform infection!\" \n\nThe Seeker gestures with one hand at the videos playing on the walls: soldiers trench fighting in France, children slowly dying of starvation in Africa, terrorists publicly beheading kneeling and blindfolded people, napalm raining down on a small fishing village. The room filled with the thunderous boom of firing ordinance and the howls of the wounded and dying. \n\nStephen's jaw drops and tears begin streaming from his eyes. He had read about these things, and yet they had not impacted him as deeply as his current sensory experience. His composure is visibly rattled as he looks on with horror at the scenes unfolding around him. \n\n \"These forbidden words: war, hate, violence, pain, suffering, these are all the legacy of the times before, when chaos and greed ruled the world. When the strong took from the weak, and the powerful abused their power.\"\n\nThe ragged man composes himself slightly, his eyes regain a sense of the resolute determination he originally had at the beginning of the interview.\n\n\"Those weren't the only wordforms excised, Seeker. I also learned of beauty, dignity, freedom, and agency. Not all wordforms lead to this destruction.\"\n\n\"Yes they do, Stephen. They are intrinsically linked. Consensus has long since determined that the idealism you consider beneficial eventually dissolves into the chaos you see around you. While one citizen may be gifted with wordform understanding motivated by positive intentions, such idealism is inevitably co-opted by the ruthless and unscrupulous. This is why all such wordforms have been excised. Why they must continue to be excised, for the good of all citizens.\"\n\n\"Good luck with that, Seeker. if you don't plan to execute me, I will tell everyone I know about these lost wordforms. I will bring them the knowledge Consensus has denied them. I will lead them to this building and I will set them free...\"\n\n\"Citizen Stephen, we will not... do that distasteful wordform you speak of. Yet we cannot allow this infection to spread. The building you found has already been cleansed, and the ground plowed under.\"\n\n\"Then I will carry all that I can in my head, and write again every book I can remember!\" Stephen crows defiantly. \n\nA sad and tired look comes over the face of the Seeker, true regret begins to spread wearily across his eyes. \n\n\"No, citizen Stephen, you will not. It is the determination of Consensus that your infection shall be treated by excision. Shortly you will be taken from this room to a rehabilitation chamber staffed with the most skilled cephalothe#BADWORDS#s in this hemisphere. They will cauterize certain neurons in your brain. When they have completed your rehabilitation, no memory of infection will remain, not even your chosen name. Regretfully this also will result in a significant impairment of physical and mental ability. You will then be given a new daily task within your acquired limitations and reintroduced to Consensus.\"\n\nThe robed man stands and turns towards the opening door. Just before exiting he turns back to Stephen and says in somber tones, \"Words are like weapons that must be taken away.\"\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412661719","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cl2mic8","link_id":"t3_2ii7wh","name":"t1_cl2mic8","parent_id":"t1_cl2m9co","retrieved_on":1426646748,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

The coat that held me in place felt so tight... Had that been there long? I didn't remember that either... The weight on my chest was no longer my pack... No longer the belt that was supposed to hold my sword... But a tight binding that held my hands at bay. The doctor that came in was in a white coat, and wore no goggles. Her companion was no longer there... The little girl with pig tails, and a never ending smile named Alice was gone.  \n\"How is the new medicine working for you Sanders?\" The doctor asked with a smile, she seamed genuinely curious about my health. Not the laughing doctor, who was experimenting on me... No... This woman was trying to make me better? My head hurt, but then why was I locked in a tiny room? Moran wasn't going to stop himself.   \n   \n  \n\"I... Feel different...\" He said finally as she kept watching him, not wavering.\n\"How so?\" She asked sitting down next to him on the floor.  \n\"Nothing.... Makes sense... Lilly! Where's Lilly?!\" He said suddenly, and the woman looked suddenly like she was going to cry... But she was smiling at the same time.\n\"Calm down... Everything will be clear with time. Why don't we go out to lunch with everyone? You'd like that wouldn't you? It's been a while...\"  \n\"Okay...\" He agreed standing up, and she released his arms. \"I'll get you a proper shirt why don't I?\" She said, and stepped out in the hall as he took it off. The scars were all there... The first time he fought Moran. Across his arms and neck... When he got Lilly back from him. Where was Lilly?  \nBut none of that was real was it? All of it was gone... The wall he had been fighting against to get out. The people trapping him. He felt ill...  \nShe pulled a green tee-shirt over his head, and lead him out to the lunch room. At one table sat Moran, he started to get angry and then stopped. The man was just eating... He wasn't in robes, he didn't hold a wand of agony... Instead a fork. He was in white clothes, and was talking to Thrillian as though they were friends.  \n\"Jack! You're out again!\" Joy walked up, walked... On her legs... She wasn't flying, she didn't have wings, her ears weren't pointed. \"Is he?\"\n\"He's slowly recovering... I thought maybe coming out here would help. He has a new medicine...\"  \n\"Does he?... Know....\"  \n\"Not yet.\"  \n\"I see...\" She smiled at him, she was wearing a doctor's coat. \"Well welcome back all the same, are you ready for your meal?\"  \nHe held his head, and pushed away the tray. Managing to say. \"Sorry... I'm not... I just need something... Can I go outside?\" He asked carefully.  \n\"I'll take you.\" The doctor said, and helped him to the door. Outside people were eating at tables. People he recognized except... They were all... Human. Silvia the dragon, and Marrium the nymph... All the elves.... All of them. Everyone was human.\n  \n\"None of it was real?\" He stared at the doctor. \"None of it at all? Oh god...\" He said staring into her eyes. \"You're Lilly...\"  \n\"I am...\" She said looking like she was going to tackle him, her smile so big as tears ran down her cheeks.  \n\"You.... And... I... And... God... Where am I?\"  \n\"Welcome back Jack. You're home...\"  \n\"There's no... The king... I...\"  \n\"It's okay.... It's okay you're home now.\" She hugged him suddenly, \"Jack you have no idea how long I've been working twards this.\"  \n\"Years... So I...\"  \n\"Jack.\"  \n\"I'm not...\"  \n\"Jack!\"  \n\"A hero?...\"  \n\"Jack don't leave me!\"  \n  \nI came out of my sleep suddenly, my wife shook my arm.\n\"Oh god Jack I though I lost you for a moment.\" Lilly lay beside me on the bed safe. \"You were screaming and then you stopped breathing.\"\n\"Huh? Oh Lilly....\" I hugged my wife, the wings on her back warm and velvety.\n\"I had a terrible dream.\" I said and kissed her gently. \"Everyone was... Different, and I was stuck in a room. You were so sad... I don't even know how to explain it. Morran was there... And Silvia, and Joy, but they were all humans like me. The magic was gone like Morran wanted.\"\n\"Oh don't say that... Oh it makes me ill...\" She said hugging me tight. \"Don't ever forget... You saved us from that.  \n\"I won't.... I won't ever forget.\" I promised. \"I'm sorry that I worried you love.\"\n\"It's okay... Lets go back to sleep. We can talk more in the morning.\"\nI fell back asleep with a feeling of anxiousness that I couldn't explain... It had felt so real... What if it wasn't a dream? Was there.... Another Lilly waiting for me to wake up? To feel reality again... What if none of it really was real? I felt worried and ill again... But as she rested her head on my chest, and fell into a peaceful slumber... I too couldn't feel anything but warmth, and love. Soon... I fell asleep, with a feeling of peace only we could know.  In my sleep... I thought I heard a feint crying for just a moment. But soon.... It was only the memory of a bad dream.

I saw no comments so took my sweet time and wrote quite a lot.\n\nWell, never mind, I enjoyed writing it either way.\n\n***\n\n\"Do it\" whispered his left\n\n\"Please, don't\" responded his right.\n\nThe opera of a constant struggle on his conscience.\n\n\"So what if it's not yours, you're hungry, aren't you?\" rang the cold tone of a thumb-sized man. He was robed in all black, matching his hair and complementing his crimson eyes.\n\n\"It's not right, Jake. How would you like it?\" said the girl in white in a softer cadence. Blond hair shimmering. Blue eyes gleaming.\n\n\"They take all your stuff all the time!\" Black hissed. He followed with empty laughter as if it were a decision that should have already been made.\n\n\"Have you ever thought that what goes around comes around?\" said White, disregarding the usual rules and confronting Black directly.\n\nJake witnessed the two storm towards one another, meeting in front of his nose. They angrily stomped on clear air as they began their heated debate.\n\n\"Stop letting him get pushed around!\" Black yelled at her.\n\n\"He shouldn't have to solve his problems with such passive aggressive behaviour!\"\n\n\"Oh, and I suppose being a doormat is the perfect solution\"\n\nWhite was taken aback, looking hurt at the absence between her feet. She regained her composure after a moment. \"I... I didn't say that. Just that not everyone has to be so rude\"\n\nThe two bickered as parents would, both making valid points in Jakes eyes. As was always the way he was forced to make a decision at last. Not wanting to see the two argue any longer he took a middle ground, taking half the doughnut before retiring to his room.\n\n\"What was the point in half a doughnut?\" asked Black with a frustrated expression, apparently still feeling at a loss.\n\nWhite laid a hand on Jakes cheek despite her eyes still being locked on Black. \"I think you did the right thing, Jake\" she came sweetly, emphasised to the point of being sickly solely to cause dismay in Black.\n\nBlack squinted his eyes. White retorted with a stuck out tongue. Jake shook the two minions from his mind and saw them continue to glare at one another as they evaporated, taking their respective homes in the recesses of his mind.\n\nJake had always had these companions, each whispering to him when he felt alone. Permitted to wander when he sat on the moral fence. Sometimes it would get distracting.\n\nHe had taken steps to remove them in the past, but nothing seemed to work. Although he adored their presence, they could make quite the mess when trying to win the battle over his moral standing.\n\nJake only wished for a method of controlling their ability to roam. One day he found it.\n\n\"Learn Thai Chi - Inquire inside\"\n\nIt was an opportunity he did not know he was searching for until right at that moment. Finally, a place to find peace; of body and of mind.\n\nJake was made for it. Like a bird flying for the first time, he revealed in every aspect of it and soon the conflicts in his head became less and less frequent.\n\n\"I'm so glad you're doing this Jake\" began White \"I'm so tired of having to interact with that child\"\n\nJake merely nodded.\n\n\"It's just you and me now\" came Black from the opposite shoulder. \"We don't need her, so uptight and do-goody all the time!\" he huffed.\n\nJake merely nodded.\n\n\"I mean... I get that it's just the way he is, but still. It may not be his fault but he can still be an arse, you know?\"\n\n\"Yeah, totally\" Jake said, adding substance to an otherwise disinterested shake of the head.\n\n\"What did she say?\" asked said Black desperately in a moment of weakness. He managed to contain himself \"I mean, did she say something\"\n\n\"Nothing\" replied Jake. He was desperately trying to get back to work. The man was bad enough at falling into distractions without being forced into conversation with two figures atop his shoulders. The training had honed his concentration but little could shield him from such a relentless annoyance.\n\n\"What's that guy trying to tell you now?\" came White, finally causing Jake to snap.\n\n\"Jeeze guys, why not just ask one other? You know, like normal— umm…\" Jake considered an appropriate follow up “Like normal make-believe creatures, I guess”\n\n\"Sorry man, but Black I have to stay left\" said Black, indicating to his long flowing robe.\n\n\"White has to stay right, Jake\" White said almost in unison as she tugged her sparkling gown.\n\nMore weeks past and Jake found himself in an ever too familiar situation. Face to face with the last double glazed.\n\nHe was just about to split it down the middle, no hesitation would usually befall him nowadays but there was suddenly a voice from his left.\n\n\"Maybe... maybe you shouldn't do that...\" it sounded.\n\n\"...Black? Are you telling me not to take this? Why?\"\n\n\"I mean, it's not yours, is it?\" he continued. Jake could swear he saw the jet black garment which d#BADWORDS# the being suddenly brighten into a dark grey.\n\nA voice from his right was now heard “You may as well have the whole thing\" \n\n\"White? Are you two okay?!\" noticing that her dress no longer shone as it had previously.\n\n\"I mean, they always take your stuff, don't they?\" she said, taking a step onto the air but still cautiously holding onto his earlobe. He could see her looking past his face as she took the first steps off his shoulder in weeks.\n\nIt all clicked. Jake chuckled silently to himself for a moment before remorsefully deciding to abandon an art that he had spent the best part of month training. He prepared for a war.\n\n\"Hey guys, what do you think I should do with this doughnut?\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412732347","downs":0,"edited":"1412732584","gilded":0,"id":"cl3dwri","link_id":"t3_2ils96","name":"t1_cl3dwri","parent_id":"t3_2ils96","retrieved_on":1426633792,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}

Her fingers twisted nervously in her lap, bitten fingernails chewed to the quick hastily splashed with a dirty purple nail varnish, showed exactly how anxious she was feeling. The chair was uncomfortable, the yellow plastic padding leaking out of the green checked material. It looked like the last time someone had replaced the chairs had been back in the sixties. That, or someone like chewing on them. Several magazines lay on the low, scuffed table in front of her. They had been glossy once, but now the torn covers were dull with age and displayed fashions at least four of five years out of date. The blue eyes of one particular model swam out towards Samantha, as though presenting her perfectly trim figure with spectacular aplomb, her ribs like a shining xylophone, reminding Samantha why she hadn't eaten yet that day-\n\n\n\n\"Shut up,\" she spoke through gritted teeth. At the other end of the waiting room, a woman with her daughter looked up at the sound of Sam's hissed tone. Noticing she was alone, she wrapped one arm around the small daughter and coughed, imperceptibly shifting till Sam could only see her cold shoulders. \n\n\n\"Don't say things like that!\" Sam muttered, placing her hand slightly over her mouth so the mother couldn't hear. \n\n\nIt's perfectly true. Sam's stomach was rumbling, and-\n\n\n\n\"Please don't do this,\" her voice had become watery, a sure sign she was about to cry. This was the reason that she no longer wore makeup, and in fact the rims of her eyes and her nostrils were already a sore red, from continuous wiping from the tissues she kept in her handbag. \n\n\nBut she got herself under control, slipping an already-chewed index finger into her mouth and gnawing away. \n\n\n\n\"Leave me alone!\" She said, loud enough for the daughter to look round. The mother stayed stoically staring ahead. \n\n\n\nThe door at the far side of the room opened and a man in a tweed jacket, bushy eyebrows rising above his glasses appeared. He frowned at the darkness of the room, flicked on a light switch. The sudden burst made Sam flinch. \n\n\n\"Samantha Lloyd?\" He announced to the room. Gratefully, Sam stood up. He didn't look too bad, this one. \n\n\n\"Doctor Williams?\" \n\n\nShe entered his office, sat down. It was pitch black. \n\n\n\"The lights are on,\" Sam said firmly, to the Doctor's mild surprise. \n\n\nSuddenly he grew fangs, large wings, a tail... \n\n\n\"The Doctor looks perfectly ordinary,\" Sam's voice was firm. \n\n\nThe glass in the windows smashed into a thousand pieces.

If it is his dad that's the devil, we need a reason why he went to hell and is supposed to tempt his son towards evil.\n\nMaybe a drinking problem, or a cheating heart, or an inferiority complex. It could be something as simple as his wife was a firmer believer in God than he was. Perhaps this is their ultimate test and they don't know it. If he thinks he's supposed to tempt the kid and she thinks she's supposed to sway him toward meekness and kindness even when rage or anger are warranted it'd be a good evaluation of whether the love of their son is stronger than their respect for the rules.\n\n2) The eraser can continue to be something the kid and the demon think about. It fits thematically because we all want to erase mistakes that are more permanent than we'd like to admit.\n\n3) The kid could use another moral dilemma with his uncle. Maybe he comes home to see him having a heart attack and the demon has to talk him into calling 911.\n\n4) There should be some conflict with love as another theme. Maybe his next girlfriend cheats on him and the following relationship has him given an opportunity to be the cheater. \n\n5) The balance of the kids soul needs to be decided as much as the fate of the angel and demon.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412812226","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cl49m9s","link_id":"t3_2ils96","name":"t1_cl49m9s","parent_id":"t1_cl3cufx","retrieved_on":1426618477,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Inexplicably, I liked it more with my bed this way and the bookshelf right there--the room's feng shui felt impeccable, and I didn't even believe in feng shui.\n\nI had also left myself a glass of water on my nightstand and a couple Aspirins, all of which I ingested gratefully.

{"archived":false,"author":"andzzy","body":"*Oops*.\n\nI stood at the edge of the cliff, admiring the landscape. Had there not been the lake of grey goo nowhere near water, you would never know that there had been a city with a population in the hundreds of thousands just twelve hours previously. The landscape truly was fantastic. There were the trees, the sounds of the birds flying through the air ... and this grey goo. Everything after this would come back to that grey goo. As I continued to look around and just take everything in, I though back to fourteen hours ago; that's when I had given the order that did ... this.\n\n\"Sir, the testing protocol is online and we're good to go.\" It gave me great pleasure to issue the order to begin. We were releasing nanorobots into the air in an attempt to show some force and get the others to back off. By others I meant the other nations. Shortly after the start of the Third World War, it was quickly decided that an alternative was required. Everyone had spent enough time worrying about Mutually Assured Destruction that we knew what was coming. There had already been several attempts to disable nuclear launch grids with computer viruses and intelligence operations, all of which were met with the strongest of failures. That's where we came in.\n\nA small research facility. That's what we were called when we were founded. Innocently enough, we were developing nanorobots for application in the medical field. As our research grew, o did our facility, and eventually we branched out. Of course, I was the coordinator in charge of the entire facility. This meant long hours and often dealing with politicians. It was enough to make me contemplate my continued work every day. It was actually on one such day as I was polishing off a nice bottle of red wine that I received the notification. *WWIII BEGUN. NEED OPTIONS. LEGALITY UNIMPORTANT.* Had it not been verifiable, I would have thought someone was actually impersonating the White House Chief of Staff. Fast forward 4 months and we had a solution! If only we knew what we were actually doing, perhaps things would be different now...\n\nThe experiment was harmless enough. We targeted nuclear weapons platforms around the world and unleashed nano-hell. Even if the nanorobots ate away at nuclear power plants, the world would be safer than it was at that moment in time. We were monitoring the results via satellite. Nuclear facilities around the world were being torn apart. It appeared to be working. We actually had a small celebration as we continued to monitor the progress. After two painful hours of this and listening to military responses from the besieged nations, we had confirmation that the final nuclear stockpile had been ... I suppose eaten would be the correct word for it. It was shortly after this that everything simply went downhill.\n\n\"Sir, I think we better take a look at that screen.\" His hands were trembling slightly. I had assumed it was from the alcohol we were drinking but no, this was definitely fear. The screen he was pointing at displayed telemetry from Moscow and Paris. The cloud of nanorobots was unmistakable. They were definitely eating the cities. The people, the buildings, everything. It was horrifying. \"Transmit the kill code.\" I couldn't have made the order clearer if I had been reaching into someone's head and controlling them. There was the clicking of keyboard buttons and then a response. Hopefully this was the end of it.\n\n\"Done.\" The code had transmitted successfully and the nanorobots appeared to burrow under the ground, presumably to decompose as they were told. 28% of Moscow. 41% of Paris. Those were the numbers that we had for amount of infrastructure and population lost in each city. It was terrifying indeed. We expected a heavy-handed response from Russia and France. We knew they were at least gonna be pissed. We turned off the satellites and moved them into position over Antarctica. That was the cover for the satellites if they were ever discovered; they were simply conducting research on the arctic region.\n\n\"Get in my office!\" I was now ushering the survivors into my quiet workspace where there was an emergency door that lead to a completely isolated facility where we could continue to survive. Six people were all that remained and as they rounded the final corner I saw it. The blob. There was no noise like you would expect from a Hollywood production. There was nothing but the subtle hiss of hydraulic systems. Tiny hydraulic systems. There was nothing I could do. The remaining people were overwhelmed. I didn't watch as I knew what was happening. I went into my office and sealed the doors. The computer wasn't working ... the nanorobots had eaten that hours ago. I had to manually force the emergency hatch open and get into the isolation facility myself. I was the only one. The coordinator was the only survivor. I wallowed in the helplessness for a little while before shutting the door. It was a rock face and so far the little deathbots had shown no interest in natural features. I lay down and tried to sleep. It took eighteen hours before the shock lessened.\n\n*Let's not do that again*. As I stood on the edge of the cliff, I remembered the hours where we had tried to stop it. What had gone wrong? Why were the nanorobots suddenly seemingly evolving? It took two hours but we finally got an answer. In the early days of the experiment, I had written a program that would allow the nanorobots to evolve and destroy everything. It was meant as a last-resort measure in case the original nuke-be-gone experiment failed and the nanorobots were unsuccessful. When we gave them the order to stop and dissolve, it was interpreted by them as a resolution of failure, and the evolution program activated. They waited until we were no longer watching and then unleashed fury upon the world. The nanorobots in the lab evolved as well, breaking out of their containers and eating everything and everyone they could get their microscopic arms on.\n\n\"What are they doing?!\" ... *Winning the war*. So we'd done it. This was no accident, it was sheer carelessness. Looking out at the world, I saw the grey goo lake and couldn't help but laugh. What was wrong with me? I wasn't a monster, and yet I'd just eliminated the human race. Birds, insects, natural things. They weren't affected, just humans. How did the little swarm of #BADWORDS#s decide on humans? It wasn't defined in the program. I sat down on the edge of the cliff, looking out and pondering. The nanorobots had dissolved. That's what the grey goo was. Fluids from inside of them. It was pretty gross, but the goo shined in the light so I didn't mind so much. There was nothing left here. I was all that remained. I strongly doubted there were any survivors. This time I looked up, knowing there was absolutely nothing I could do and that there would be no future for me. Only one word came to mind in this moment.\n\n*Oops.*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412976395","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cl61n56","link_id":"t3_2iup4k","name":"t1_cl61n56","parent_id":"t3_2iup4k","retrieved_on":1426587949,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Charley walked briskly down the corridor, expecting him to emerge and come after her. He didn't. The 'V' button glowed purple at its edge when she pressed it. Didn't it normally glow red? They must have changed it. She waited. G.......1...2.....3....4.......5. Ding. The doors opened. A man with a briefcase paused for a moment as if he were about to do something unseemly, then walked out, past Charley and down the corridor. His eyes were a little too big, perhaps. The thought didn't linger as she stepped in and hit 'G'. Her phone rang. It was Frank. She sighed and rejected the call. Frank had always been an ass. All she had learnt today was that Frank was still an ass and that she wouldn't endeavour to see him again for some time. \n\n5....4......3....the doors opened. No one was there. 3......2......1.....G.........................Charley was waiting for the doors to open. But she was definitely still moving downwards. She called out. The only reply was the whirr of wires and the ambient sense of motion.\n\nTime, as if unaware that some people had places to be, continued to pass. Charley did her best to look impatient, but no one was watching. She moved to the corner. She perused the interface, again making sure that anyone who might be watching saw that she was approaching the situation calmly and methodically. She tried the &lt;|&gt; button, and raised an eyebrow at the nonetheless audaciously closed doors. She tried the &gt;|&lt; button. Nothing happened. She tried the alarm button, to no effect but a patronising purple glow around its edge. She pressed the G button again. She pressed it again. She tried 1. Then 2. Then 3, 4, and 5. The alarm button. She stopped, stepped back to the other side of the elevator and smiled to demonstrate how calmly she was handling the situation. She waited a moment before launching herself at the interface, and having snagged her composure on the opposite wall and left it there, frenziedly sliding her hands across the myriad buttons before taking a finger and stabbing them at random.\n\nThere was a soft *thud*. Charley looked up from her breathless work. She had stopped moving. The doors opened. To Charley's surprise, the doors had opened on hinges. Outwards. She cautiously made her way through the doors and out into the lobby. Less surprisingly given her trip, the lobby was not the lobby. The walls were stone, and old. There was a faint natural light coming from somewhere but she could not see where. She turned back, but where there had been open doors there was now stone wall. Charley moved on down the corridor. She called out. She had been hoping for an echo, but there was none. Eventually she emerged into an enormous chamber. \n\nNo, that didn't describe it. It was a cavern. It was a monstrosity of space. It was...it moved down and out and up and although she thought she could see the walls out of the corner of her eye when she looked the space stretched out on out of sight. Figures sprawled across the floor, moving and sitting and climbing and writing and jumping and digging and crawling and running in circles and pointing at each other. From a distance they looked to Charley like normal people. But she had a scared su#BADWORDS#ion that they did not look normal up close. And above it all...the noise. A noise that filled not just her ears but her mind and her pores. It wasn't harsh and it didn't deafen, it was simply utterly *all-consuming*. Was it talking? The talking of the figures below? Or was it a humming? The people humming, or some great machine, or the earth itself? And where was that damn light coming from, it was so much brighter now. And what colour was it? Every time Charley reached for a colour in her mind it was wrong. Catastrophically wrong. The man behind her coughed.\n\nThere was a man behind her. His eyes were a little too big, perhaps. \"You're not, ah, you're um...where do you think you are?\" he inquired, blinking his way into the situation. \"I was trying to get to the lobby.\" Charley replied with an embarrasingly upward inflection, for which she internally cursed herself. \"I see.\" said the man. \"There seems to have been something of a technical balls up I'm afraid.\" He wrung his hands. \"You've rather reached the Knowledge.\" Charley frowned. \"The Knowledge?\" \"Yes,\" the man continued. \"All the Knowledge is down here, we sort of...well I shan't bother explaining it now.\" Charley suddenly felt very embarrassed. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here should I?\" The man attempted a reassuring smile, failing every step of the way. \"Well, yes, it could be potentially disastrous, but only on a cosmic level you understand.\" He looked at Charley, then out into the space, and back down the corridor. \"If you wouldn't mind just waiting here for a moment and, well, try not to hear anything too earth-shatteringly significant.\" \n\nThe man fumbled his way through another smile and left Charley there. She sat on a seemingly existent plastic bench and tried not to hear the noise.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1412993190","downs":0,"edited":"1412993375","gilded":0,"id":"cl68ls4","link_id":"t3_2iwho8","name":"t1_cl68ls4","parent_id":"t3_2iwho8","retrieved_on":1426584664,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":false,"author":"TheYellowBas#BADWORDS#","body":"\"Leave your keys behind the bar dude\"\n\nFiner words were never spoken; unfortunately these fine words were not adhered to. I can still hear them, the voices of doctors, paramedics, fire men and of course the rubber neckers.\n\nI'm floating away now, it's kind of like they show it on TV! Away I float looking at the entanglement of metal that was my car, concaved into a concrete pillar, and there I am, pulverized and lifeless.\n\nI'm a little surprised I'm not apprehensive or terrified, if anything I'm awash with calm and acceptance, not no mention sobriety, hangover free sobriety which is at least one thing to be thankful for.\n\nI float further away, hard to tell which way I'm going, but further away I know for a fact. Everything is a blur now, no more details just flat colours, I've just gone past white which was a little surprising, I was pretty sure white was going to be the colour I stopped in, TV isn't always right then, eventually though, several shades after while I do stop.\n\nMauve...not what I was expecting but there you go, suddenly a voice boomed from seemingly every direction.\n\n\"Tarquin Holt! You have foolishly extinguished your own flame on your planet; such neglect has delivered you here to I, the mauve voice of judgment and trials\"\n\nI tried to speak, I tried to offer some manner of retort, but what the voice said was pretty accurate so I remained silent.\n\n\"From the mauve there are paths to the white..\"\n\n\"So there IS a white! Man, Hollywood knows what it's doing...\"\n\n\"SILENCE!!! As I was saying. From the mauve there are paths to the white but also to the black the path on which you roam will depend on three trials.\"\n\n\"What trails? And what is the white, what is the black?\"\n\nThe voice spoke out to me again, somewhat agitated this time.\n\n\"The black and white are what you imagine them to be, for each person who settles in the mauve black and white are always different. The trials are a much simpler affair, you shall compete against the guardian of the white in a contest of his choosing and you shall do the same with the guardian of the black.\n\nIf you defeat the guardian of the white you will have the option to spend eternity there, if you lose against the guardian of the white you must compete against that of the black, victory is to stay in the mauve, defeat, and you remain in the black.\"\n\nThe stakes had certainly been raised, five minutes ago I was floating around and soaking up colour, now I'm competing for my eternity?! I'd have been happier in the car wreck! \n\n\"What is the third trial then?\" \n\nThe voice of the mauve responded (I don't think he liked me, I could have sword he sighed!)\n\n\"The third trial is with I, the omnipotent mauve voice of judgment and trials, should you lose against white but defeat the black you will have a free choice of challenge against the mauve, if you are defeated in the mauve, then in the mauve you shall remain as you see it now, should you defeat the mauve, you will be given a catalogue, to help brighten the place up a bit\"\n\n...\n..\n\"O....K...I'd have to say voice of mauve, the catalogue has taken a bit of the dramatic edge away from all of this..\"\n\n\"SILENCE!!!! Prepare yourself for the guardian of the white\"\n\nThe very second he finished the sentence I was #BADWORDS# into whiteness and it was just like on TV! Clouds, golden gates, angels, dead celebrities all that stuff, and there he was, the big man (about 6'6 if you're wondering), God.\n\n\"Hi God\" I probably should have thought of something more noble..\n\nGod, sounding surprisingly like Michael Jackson went about setting me his trial\n\n\"Tarquin Holt you have been sent by the mauve voice of judgment and trials to face judgment and trial at the hands of the guardian of the white in a challenge of my choosing, brace yourself human, the trail, shall be trial by combat.\"\n\nYou have got to be kidding; I have to beat god in a fist fight!\n\n\"Seriously! All the people who get to the white from the mauve have defeated you in a trial by combat?\"\n\n\"No, usually it's Cluedo, but the mauve voice of judgment and trials is my brother in law and he doesn't seem to like you, he helped me move a couple of weekends ago so I owe him a favour...ARE YOU READY MORTAL?\"\n\nI didn't even get the chance to raise my feeble arms before I was face down in the...clouds. God was not the loving person I had imaged, right after right rained down on my jaw, I was swallowing teeth and blood, God then went to work the body, punting my ribs with the force of a truck, shattering my bones \nand crushing my organs, fifteen seconds in, it was over.\n\nI found myself back in the mauve, healed and well rested.\n\nThe mauve voice of judgment and trials chirped up again, he wasn't even hiding it this time I could hear him s#BADWORDS#ing as he spoke.\n\n\"So...I assume you trial with the white did not go to well\"\n\nI thought it best to hold my tongue as the chance of me challenging the mauve had increased; there was no sense in making him hate me more.\n\n\"Never mind human, it is now time for your trial against the guardian of the black, good luck\"\n\nAs before I was #BADWORDS# into blackness, but from there the back turned to an inferno of red, screams of pain, red dogs gorging on the faces of lawyers, little red impy things with wings, the whole shebang.\n\n\"ARE YOU READY PUNY CREATUE\"\n\nAn ocean deep booming voice that shook me to my very core rang out, I turned around and dropped to my knees, it was Satan, Lucifer..The Devil, glowing red, fifteen feet tall, incomprehensible weight, my heart more than sank, it plummeted\n\n\"ARE YOU DEAF AS WELL AS FEEBLE! I ASK AGAIN, ARE YOU READY!\"\n\n\"I suppose I'll have to be, trial by combat by any chance?\"\n\n\"HUMAN, THIS IS NOT THE WHITE THIS IS MY HOUSE! - DANCE OFF\"\n\n\"I'm sorry what...\"\n\n\"CLEAN YOUR EARS YOU VERMIN - DANCE OFF\"\n\nI could scarcely believe it, a fresh wave of optimism flowed through me, I was no fighter but I had attended the finest dance schools in the world for as long as I could remember, it was my life.\n\n\"PREPARE YOURSELF HUMAN\"\n\nSo I sat down and tightened my laces. I was getting ready to dance with the devil.\n\n\"YOU FIRST, HIT IT REGIONALD\"\n\nWith that a corpse riddled swing band arose from the embers and began to play. \n\nDespite the nerves and sweltering heat I pulled off what could only be described as a mesmerizing display of free dance, it was controlled and elegant yet untamed and free; I finished on j#BADWORDS# hands and turned to the Devil.\n\n\"Let's see what you've got, Luci\"\n\nLucifer chuckled, and arose slowly, with great difficulty; he looked withered as if he was defeated before he even started, Humble pie was no apple, the big red #BADWORDS# could dance. I couldn't bear to watch as I knew he was condemning my soul to blackness but yet I couldn't turn away, this was utter technical perfection, a master class, each turn, each moved flowed effortless into the next, no effort wasted not even a finger out of place, hours passed but the devil kept dancing. My soul long since claimed, Satan finished with j#BADWORDS# hands, turned to me a winked a fiery wink, with that I was incinerated on the spot.\n\nI sit now in the waiting room, waiting for processing, it's not too bad so far, they give you paper and pens, a drink of milk from time to time, I don't even know why I'm writing this, there is no one to read it, maybe I'll leave it on my chair hoping for someone to find.\n\nThere are thousands of us here, maybe more, I can spot them every now and again you catch the glimpse of a professional dancer shamed but in awe, their spirits having been raised and quickly crushed.\n\nLeave your keys behind the bar dude...good advice.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1413197664","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cl84i5o","link_id":"t3_2j37dn","name":"t1_cl84i5o","parent_id":"t3_2j37dn","retrieved_on":1426552123,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"metakaos","body":"\"But you do have the Gift! This is where the signal originated! Is it... held in silence? Is it... hiiiirruummnnnn...\"\nThe eyeless, intricately articulated exoskeleton once again paused to search for an appropriate word, its graceful iridescent form nearly touching the fluorescent lights and drop ceiling of our hastily appropriated conference room. Mounted like stubby half-formed arms on either side of its armored thorax were two speaker-like pods. Although the set of legs just beneath them had been seen grasping objects, the pods gesticulated as they spoke in an eerie, overtone-accompanied approximation of a human voice. \n\n\"-iiiiiirrrrummuuuu...\" The motion of those pods settled into what I read as resignation as the flanging effect they produced began to die down. At that moment 0630 on the wall-mounted clock caught my attention. \n\n*Fourteen hours. We've been at this for a total of Four. Teen. Hours. And we're still stuck on this crucial detail.*  \n\nI sipped the last of my coffee and continued. \"Look, we just need to understand your command structure. Your rules. Laws. Uh, agreements? We just don't want any more misunderstandings like earlier.\"\n\nThe first of those hours had nearly ended the exchange altogether, as the rest of my research team was pulled out of the room when their tendency to talk over each other caused visible agitation in the subject. Much of my time since becoming our spokesman by default had been spent merely figuring out a polite form of address. The haunting melody it responded with when I asked its name proved too long to even attempt to transliterate into something pronounceable by human vocal cords.\n\n\"Listen. Like this.\" Our guest replied. *Here we go.*\n\nI drew a second underline and recorded the time as 0632 beneath the entry already marked 0055 and 2301. The same up-tempo tune that served as the creatures reply to that question twice earlier didn't make any more sense this time around. Oblivious to the deadly response it had nearly provoked from the guards on either side of the door just hours before, it again gyrated its grasping limbs, hind legs and abdomen, holding its pods at roughly my eye level. \n\nThough we hadn't gotten far with the basics - rank structure, protocol for address, the very concepts of sex and gender, etc - much had come from our attempts to determine the source of confusion. Despite their intimidating, armored appearance, organized conflict between members of their species was virtually nonexistent. They understood hierarchy, but seemed to have no permanent ones of their own.\n\nTheir understanding of electromagnetic and acoustic phenomena, far in advance of ours, made them capable of both sophisticated telecommunications and terrifying weapons. Somehow obtaining the unanimous consent of every member of their species to do so, they had annihilated the \"discordant\" races of the galaxy, leaving only those they could \"sing\" with. The ones with the Gift. No arguments, no power struggles. Just... harmony.\n\n\"The Gift. You know we have it?\" *You believe we have it? Hopefully?*\n\nIt stopped singing. \"This is proof. It came from here. Our listeners isolated your signal. Your King song! You know this.\" \n\nThere it was again. This word seemed too consistent in use to be a translation error, and it was the closest thing we had to common ground on questions of law and order, but I couldn't puzzle it out. What place would the concept of royalty have to people without laws or rulers? \n\n\"Ok, so you sing and, uh, dance with each other? And this is how you decide who's in charge and what to do?\"\n\n\"Your dance.\"\n\n\"Right.\" I sighed. \"My dance. You would sing and dance, and occasionally there was discord but you would sing until... convergence.\"\n\n\"Yes. Just like you.\" Its posture perked up at my statement. \"We seek convergence with you now. We seek harmony. Your dance. Your song. Everyone in harmony!\" \n\nIt picked up where it left off, dance and all, slowing down even more like a tourist enunciating words in his native tongue. There was something almost jovial in the overtones. Familiar, even. Only a second after I realized I was humming along did the lyrics escape my lips.\n\n*You ain't nothing but a hound dog...*\n\nThe creature straightened to its full height, shifting its pods around in excitement before speaking. \"Your King song! You know it! We know it! We all sing together now!\"\n\n\"Are you...?\" \n\n\"Peaceful like us! Harmony like us! Sing together!\"\n\n*Oh. Oh no.* \"We don't-\" \" I cut that sentence off and buried my head in my hands, glancing down at my empty mug and the scribbled notes between my elbows.\n\n*Discord seeking silence.*  The phrase circled in my notes quoted our now-overjoyed Elvis impersonator, from when I had tried to illustrate how our government works by playing an audio recording of a congressional debate. Before it had demanded that I \"silence\" the recording permanently. Before I had known that they had done the same to so many others. \n\nIt paused again, resuming the song only when I began to nervously hum along, head still in my hands. I don't know the other lyrics.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1413284749","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cl920q5","link_id":"t3_2j42eh","name":"t1_cl920q5","parent_id":"t3_2j42eh","retrieved_on":1426535613,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}
{"archived":false,"author":"ljthun01","body":"“Honey, come out onto the porch – I don’t want the fridge to hear us.”\nI had decided it was time to talk to my beloved granddaughter, Tilda, about this robot she had been cavorting around with for several weeks now.\n\n“What is it Grandpa?” she asked, large doe eyes beaming in the afternoon sunlight.  She always knew the face to make when her grandpa got serious.  It helped to melt the ice around my heart.\n\n“What’s the name of that toas- uh- robot you have been spending so much time with?”\n\nShe blushed, apparently completely caught off guard by the question.\n\n“Well…umm… HER name is UBI 988.  Why do you ask?”\n\nI was uneasy.  I knew Tilda didn’t have the…traditional sexual orientation.  Granted, things are a lot different now than they were fifty years ago.  The first robot marriage happened ten years ago, and since then all the kids have been involving themselves in inter-active relationships with those dirty toasters.  \n\n“You know, Tilda, when I was younger robots were just for sexual gratification.  They weren’t intended for that kind of…intimacy.”\n\n“Well things are different now Grandpa!” tears had sprung to her eyes, “UBI 988 and I are in love!  And we’re going to be together no matter what you say!”\n\nAt this she ran inside, upstairs, and into her room slamming the door behind her.\nI sat down slowly on the porch and lit up a cigarette.  I hadn’t expected Tilda to be so serious with that new robot.  It had only been a month or two.  Those toasters could be dangerously convincing – even addictive.  I though back to my first wife, Nicole.  A few weeks after our wedding day I was taken advantage of.  By a Roomba.  I had gotten too drunk and was passed out on the couch.  The Roomba was our servant girl – we just called her Rummy.  I always knew she had a thing for me by the way she softly purred every time I was near.  A few hours after I had fallen asleep on the couch, I woke up on the floor with my pants down and my #BADWORDS# out.  I had been vacuumed.\n\nRecalling these memories made me hate robots all the more.  I flicked my cigarette into the street and resolved to charge up to Tilda’s room and assure her that no robot was ever welcome in my house, when all of a sudden I heard a soft voice from behind me,\n\n“Excuse me, are you Tilda’s grandfather?”\n\nI whirled around, and there she was – that damn dirty toaster.  I couldn’t keep myself from snarling.\n\n“She’s inside, and wants nothing to do with you.  Get off of my property!”\n\n“Please – there’s something you need to know.  I want you to meet my mother.”\n\nShe stepped aside and my jaw dropped. \nOut from behind her rolled Rummy – my robotic #BADWORDS# from years before.  I didn’t quite know how to feel.  The anger I had previously felt completely subsided upon seeing her soft robotic features.  She looked great.\n\n“Rummy?  It’s been…years.”\n\nA familiar feeling was beginning to boil up within me.  Something I hadn’t felt in a long time.\n\n“Please come inside.  Tilda is upstairs,” I gestured for UBI 988 to go on ahead.\n\nWhen Rummy and I entered the kitchen, nothing could stop the explosion of passion and sexual tension that occurred.  And occurred.

{"archived":false,"author":"gre#BADWORDS#iere42","body":"“Jerry, did you check the cooling units like I asked?” Brian shouted as he steered the boat out of New Hopes port. He was in good spirits; their last scavenging haul had brought enough hard currency in for him to upgrade to a newer cooling system, letting him and his crew stay out in the Hot Zone longer.\n\n“I checked it three times,” Jerry shouted back, “Twice for you, and once for me. I don’t like being boiled alive either.” He then turned back to Andy and the two of them resumed checking the cooling suits that allowed for travel on the land masses out in the Hot Zone.\n\nSmiling, Brian maneuvered the boat around the buoys that signified the maximum safe distance without needing a cooling device. New Hope was situated right on the edge of the habitable space left on Earth, and was the largest city. Twenty million people sat situated two clicks from the Hot Zone on one side, and two clicks from the Cold Zone on the other side. 120 square miles of businesses, homes, factories, and general mass mayhem that made it the shining jewel of New Earth, as some had taken to calling it.\n\n“Brian, you headed out?” a voice chimed in over the radio.\n\nBrian picked up the receiver, “Dwyer, of course I’m headed out. I have new toys, and they must be played with.”\n\nA slight chuckle was heard on the other end, “Finally got that new cooling system?”\n\n“Damn right. Capable of withstanding temperatures up to 350 degrees Celsius,” Brian said with a smile. \n\n“Where you headed?” Dwyer asked.\n\n“Dead Man’s Point.”\n\n“Seems a little tame for a test run, Brian,” Dwyer said. “That’s only what, fifteen clicks out?”\n\n“Well I don’t want to burn something out and die, thank you very much,” Brian retorted. “And it’s sixteen clicks.”\n\nAnother chuckle. “Well David over here in weather said a big Hot Front is moving in. Better batten down the hatches out there. You know where the cave is out there?”\n\n“10-4.”\n\n“Good. Stay cool.”\n\n“You too,” Brian said as he replaced the receiver. A Hot Front could be bad news, but there was no point in worrying. He had a new cooling system to test and, if they had time, some sal#BADWORDS#e to find.\n\n*two hours later*\n\n“Hey Jerry,” Brian asked, “what readings are we getting here?”\n\nJerry tapped on computer in front of him before motion Brian to come closer. “Looks like we’re sitting at a cool 39 degrees C inside, and a balmy 110 degrees outside.”\n\n“Power output?”\n\nJerry tapped a few more keys, “We are sitting at 28% power output, and everything is in the green. Seems like everything’s installed correctly.”\n\nBrian clapped Jerry on the shoulder, “Good man.”\n\nAt that moment, Andy stuck his head into the cabin, “Hot Front, big one.”\n\nJerry and Brian looked at each other and then rushed to the observation deck. Andy wasn’t lying, the Hot Front was massive. Huge black and grey clouds towered over the ocean giving themselves the appearance of mountains rather than clouds. The sky beneath them was so black they could hardly make out where the clouds ended and the ocean began. Small streaks of fire rained down sporadically from ocean debris that had been flung high enough up to cause it to spontaneously combust. Usually when a Hot Front hit New Hope it had calmed down to just a severe thunderstorm, so this was a rare, and impressive, treat.\n\nSuddenly, unusual movement caught Brian’s eye. He grabbed his binoculars and looked out into the storm. A small boat was bobbing and dodging in the waves, desperately trying to not drown. They were headed straight for Dead Man’s Point, the only landmass within miles.\n\n“What in God’s name…” he whispered.\n\nJerry looked at him confused until Brian passed him the glasses, “Holy #BADWORDS#,” he whispered as he passed them to Andy. “#BADWORDS#…”\n\n“I’ve gotta get on the horn. Andy, who are they?” Brian said as he rushed back to the main bridge.\n\nAndy muttered for a minute, “No registration numbers. I don’t recognize the boat either.”\n\n“#BADWORDS#, just what we needed. Damn civies out here doing a scavs job,” I muttered to myself.\n\n“Civilian vessel, this is the Scav vessel *New Frontier*, please identify,” Brian said into the radio. \n\nStatic. “Civilian vessel, this is *New Frontier*, please, if you can see us, follow us into the cave on the leeward side of this landmass. It’s the only safe place.”\n\nBrian stood back up and nodded to Jerry and Andy. They couldn’t wait. If they were caught in that storm then it could mean the end of not only their chosen careers, but their lives. \n\nPutting the engine to full power, Brian checked behind them to see if the boat was getting in closer. Squinting, he thought the boat might have pulled ahead of the storm just a touch, which meant they had a chance. Not wanting to risk his own life though, he went around to the cave as quickly as possible and hoped they found it.\n\nFive minutes later, they did. Andy and Jerry were finishing attaching the mooring clamps to the cave walls when the strange boat putted into the cave. Less than a minute after that, the storm hit. Brian listened to the thunder and lightning for a few moments before deciding this was going to be a long one and there was no point in not getting friendly.\n\n“Ahoy the vessel!” he shouted, but then made a hand motion to Jerry and Andy. Pirates were real out here on the seas, and he was not going to take any chances.\n\n“Ahoy!” came a voice from inside the ship. A few moments later, four people disengaged themselves from the ship, all four wearing unusual cooling suits.\n\n“Where do you hail from?” Brian asked, feeling the boat shift as Andy and Jerry came back up carrying three rifles.\n\n“Bloom Town,” one of the figures said back. Their face masks were blacked out still, so Brian had no idea if they were male or female. “It’s about forty miles,” the figure spun to point out towards the Hot Zone, “That way.”\n\nBrian, Andy and Jerry all three stared at each other. That was impossible.

Of course it would have to rain again today, it's not like I need another reminder.  We did everything we could: tests, simulations, and studies, but today we will get the results.  I'll either be the savior of the world, or the pariah of mankind.\n\nStill no news, so I take another look out the window at the building.  Eighty years ago, when there were only 4 Billion or so people on the planet, this building allowed us to set foot on another world, even if it was only Earth's moon.  Now there was over 8 billion souls, and Earth was struggling to support them all.  Ten years ago we started project Sister World.  We had colonies on Mars, but it was obvious that we could not live there without domes, and there was not enough resources to move several billion people there.  Venus was too hot, and there was no way it could be colonized. Unless...\n\nThat's were we come in.  It took ten years and close to a trillion dollars, but we created a genetically designed microbe that could in theory metabolize the carbon dioxide in Venus' atmosphere to oxygen.  As the percentage of oxygen increases, the mean temperature of Venus should begin to drop.  The microbe will continue the process until the temperature drops to the point where water can exist in liquid form, then the microbes will die, having done their job.  Liquid water means rain, and rain means life.\n\nWe launched the package six months ago, and yes#BADWORDS#ay it reached Venus.  The payload dropped as planned, and now we are waiting to see if our little microbes will actually work.  \n\nAs the summer rain ended, I heard my door open.

I always did like math; counting things made it all less dull. All 23 hours of staring at the same painted bricks. Nothing changing, a routine that would drive a potato to madness. Madness coupled with the crippling guilt of  rash decisions made by a troubled 16 year old. I wonder if that is why I saw him.\n\nHis name was Steve and he was the biggest ladies man at school. His life was perfect, good grades, star football player, class president, the most popular kid in town. Until that day. \n\nAfter one year of laying in that single cell, he came to me. He looked very solid. He could have been the real Steve, if it weren't for the fact that I watched him float through my ceiling. That, and I knew Steve was dead.\n\nHe stood next to my bed, just looking at me. He didn't look angry, or upset, or even sad. He just looked at me with those blue-green eyes that made all the girls swoon. After what felt like hours, I finally found my voice.\n\n\"Hello.\" I had to start somewhere.\n\n\"Hello, John. I have waited a very long time to talk to you.\"\n\n\"I don't understand, what could someone like you have to say to me?\"\n\nHis expression darkened a bit. \"Someone like me? What am I to you?\"\n\n\"A popular kid. You had no reason to even look at me until that day. Have you come to tell me I'm going to hell? Or maybe to just make me feel worse about what I think about all day, every day?\"\n\nI swear he almost smiled at me.\n\n\"No John, I came here for a different reason. I know you feel guilty. What you did eats you up inside, all day, every day. I came here to help you. To say thank you.\"\n\n\"Why would you thank me, Steve? I shot you three times. I ended your perfect life.\"\n\n\"My life was far from perfect.You saved me. You took me away from my abusive father who would never think I was good enough. From my mother who always told me she was better off without me. My life was going to end that day regardless, you saved me from my own cowardice.\"\n\n\"You're telling me you planned on killing yourself after school?! Why didn't you get help?\"\n\n\"Why didn't you?\"\n\n\"That's not important anymore. What's done is done.\"\n\n\"It is done, but I wanted to let you feel like you didn't do something completely horrible that day. I wanted to give you some peace. This is where I leave you John, how you carry your guilt from here is up to you.\"\n\nThere was no angelic light that bore him heavenward, he didn't even float away. He was just gone. Faster than a blink. \n\nI almost expected to see the other 14, but there were no more apparitions. I spent months believing that he was a hallucination, nothing more than a product of my incredibly understimulated mind. Yet I felt better. Real or not, those words made me guilt easier to carry for almost a year. None of that will matter tomorrow. Tomorrow I die.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1413613275","downs":0,"edited":"1413613533","gilded":0,"id":"clcqub7","link_id":"t3_2jkmaz","name":"t1_clcqub7","parent_id":"t3_2jkmaz","retrieved_on":1426471362,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

The goon on the other side of the door did not look like it had ever had a mother either, or if it had then it might have eaten her for extra protein.  At least three hundred pounds, probably solid muscle, all of it perpetually pissed-off Eastern European.\n\n\"Oh, good morning, Boris.

The Job. No time to think about that now.  No time for regrets.  Phone destroyed, family (such as it was) would have to wait.  Pick up the pieces later, just like he always ended up doing.  \"Sure, Boris, let me get my coat.\"\n\n\"No time.  No coat.  You come with Boris now.\"\n\n\"OK, OK, whatever...\"  Defeated, John meekly followed the thug out through the door, which wouldn't stay closed, and down through the hallways and staircases to the lobby, past the permanently out-of-order elevator (John could never remember a time when it had been in-order), and out to the curb where a black van (don't they always drive black vans?) was parked, idling, the driver lounging behind the wheel.\n\nThey both got in, John in front, Boris in back.  The doors clicked locked as the driver shifted and drove out into traffic.\n\n\"You take this.  You will need it.\"  Boris handed John a heavy object wrapped in a paper bag.  John's heart sank a little bit.  He knew what was probably about to happen.\n\n\"Where are we going, anyway?\"\n\n\"The financial district.\"\n\nJohn glanced at the clock on the dash.

It was the last remaining testament of man's arrogance that would ultimately lead to his end. The black symbols on the ship's bone-colored shell that Sena knew so well were fading, too. Only \"Ichar\" was all that was visible, now.\n\nThe whinny of Sena's horse brought his attention back down to the horizon ahead of him, where a white dot slowly pulsed against the bright green and black rock. It drew closer to him ever so slowly, and Sena wondered if Druva even regarded this meeting with any sense of urgency at all. \n\nDruva rode towards him. He was obscured as he rode under the long shadow of the ship and he appeared to Sena the same as when they last saw each other twenty years ago, at this very place, coincidentally. But when Druva emerged into the sunlight, it was apparent that the years had beared down on him. He approached cautiously.\n\n\"You're late,\" Sena reminded him.\n\n\"You should be grateful that I am even here, Sena,\" Druva responded cooly. \"If the Elders were to find out about this meeting, they would-\"\n\n\"Which is why we should not waste time. Come with me.\" \n\nSena whipped his horse around and shot past Druva in full gallop. Druva watched him fade out quickly into the mist and rode fast to catch up to him. He remembered when their younger days when they would ride out into battle, when they once fought under the same banner before the Great Migration of the Clans. \n\nBy the time they reached the end of the Outer Lands, Druva was wondering if he was being led into a trap. He cursed himself for trusting Sena and coming alone. Sena had also begun to suspect that Druva was up to something, as he was keeping his distance, like a predator cornering its prey. But Druva needed to see this, Sena thought. No matter the risk to his own life, this had to be done. \n\nA giant cave opening that Druva had never seen before came into view as they rounded the corner. Sena got off his horse and started walking towards it. He turned around and gestured for Druva to follow him. Druva was now certain that it was a trap, and he pressed his arm against his side to ensure that his blade was equipped. \n\nWhen walked up to cave he saw that Sena was standing next to a man, bound and gagged on the floor. He was partially obscured by the darkness, but Druva noticed that he was dressed unlike any other clansmen. The man shot up wildly when he saw Druva in what appeared to be a desperate cry for help, but was struck in the face by Sena.\n\n\"I wanted to show you this back at the mountain,\" Sena told him, \"but you would have suspected me of some kind of deception. Which is why I needed you to come here.\" \n\nDruva watched Sena calmly,  on the ready.\n\n\"As you know, I scout this location from time to time, as do all the clans in accordance with the truce\" said Sena as he walked up to Druva. \"And two days ago, I found him wandering around...and he had this on him.\" \n\nIt was the bright crimson light that caught Druva's eye and stopped him from \nreactively pulling out his blade. Sena held out a small metal device  with two shining red symbols that lit up the cave. Druva had never seen anything like it, but he knew that it came from the Second Era. Except it looked new. His face was frozen.\n\n\"How?\" he asked Sena.\n\n\"I don't know. I tried to get him to speak, but I could not understand him. It almost sounds like the old tongue.\"\n\nDruva could not look away from the man, who was staring back at him, struggling to wring his hands free.\n\n\"Druva, are you listening to me? I cannot go to the Elders alone on this. They will only listen to my father. We must bring them together.\" \n\n\"Yes. Yes they need to see this\" said Druva. Right at that moment the bound man managed to free his hands and pull the gag out of his mouth, but not fast enough to escape Sena, who was now kicking him fiercely. The man doubled over and screamed out in the old language.\n\nSena never knew that Druva studied the old tongue under his grandfather, although this was limited, since the old man passed away before any real learning could be done. \n\nBut Druva looked on in horror as he understood what the man was yelling out.\n\n\"They are coming. They are coming for all of you.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1413875079","downs":0,"edited":"1413875663","gilded":0,"id":"clfdqnr","link_id":"t3_2jucfc","name":"t1_clfdqnr","parent_id":"t3_2jucfc","retrieved_on":1426426217,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":false,"author":"Kitsu_Miya","body":"Mom said that it was exactly like a doctor's appointment. I couldn't believe her, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nNo one alive remembered how the Test was ins#BADWORDS#uted. All those who come out don't remember anything about the conditions of the test, only that it was painless. I think it has to do with the barcode on my arm, some bioscanner or something. Just as easy as scanning a can of soda in the grocery store. The only thing that changes is everything. Suddenly, you know the course of your life: your career, your life partner, your future family, your death. It's all planned for you, based on a few lines on your arm.\n\nI always thought that was kinda stupid. I mean, I'm only eighteen, I won't even be legal to do the things I'm supposed to do. No one has approached me with love declarations yet, so I guess my life partner is younger than me. My mother always joked that she didn't need the Test to tell her that dad was right one for her. I think it's a sweet sentiment, but I'm also sure that she's lying.\n\nMom said that having all that information available to her was a good thing. She knew when each of us were going to be born, so she could prepare properly for our coming. She even knew when Dad was going to die, so they could properly spend time together during the preceding weeks. She said that having that information made it easier. She could plan and foresee the bumps in the road. She said that she was really happy. I'm not sure I agree with that sentiment.\n\nI was digging around in the library, trying to find books from a time before the Test. I found one, only one, a certain An Abundance of Katherines. It was really beat up and shoved into the back corner, as a book abandoned and left for dead, its ideas from a forgotten age. In a way, it was everything I was familiar with, except it wasn't. It was an equation, an algorithm that could determine even one aspect of one's life. But it wasn't. Because it was a world that wasn't defined by the Test, or any test. I read the book and found the world that wasn't my world. And I wanted it so badly.\n\nThat was weeks ago, and I still can't get it out of my head. I realized something that day: I didn't want to know. My career, my future love, that's my decision to make, my adventure to find. I don't want a roadmap, I want a choice. And I wasn't going to have that. \n\nCould I really live my life knowing the script?\n\nI don't really have a choice. I get my part tomorrow.\n\n\n\nMay have misinterpreted the prompt, oh well.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414011325","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clgx1pe","link_id":"t3_2k065k","name":"t1_clgx1pe","parent_id":"t3_2k065k","retrieved_on":1426399813,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

If you want to correct me please do so. Just make it constructive! Thanks**\n\n\n\n\"James, I need you to bury me. That is all I ask of you.\" A tear ran down Samantha's face as she looked at me. It crept slowly over her high cheekbone and slipped slowly into the corner of her mouth. She licked at it out of habit, every bit of water did count. Not anymore though. Not now. Not when she knew it was her turn. I could see it in the deep blue pools of her eyes. She was done. \n\n\"Okay.\" I said,\"Okay, I'll bury you, Sammy. I promise.\" \n\n\"Thank you.\" These were her last words. \n\nI couldn't watch so I walked away. I kept walking, but I knew I would have to come back. I had a promise to keep. While I walked, I thought, I thought about how soon it would be my turn. Then I tried not to think at all.\n\nHours later, I came back to her corpse. Little Sammy, it had all come to this. Little Sammy, just a crumpled heap in a pool of ruby. She had been so strong. She had fought so long and hard only to be brought to this. I looked at her face, hoping to see what the others had shown me in death. I wanted to see peace. I wanted to see release. I wanted to see freedom. All I saw were tears. The tears that ran down her cheeks in her final moments. Then, all I saw was blood. It had started in the slits of her wrists. Now it was in her hair. Her shirt was soaked. I could just see her grasping at it in her final moments, as she bled. I turned away before I could make myself sick and went to find a shovel. I had a promise to keep. \n\nAs I dug Sammy's grave, I cried. I cried because I realized that I could not go through with it. I could not kill myself. But I couldn't think of that now. I had to bury Sammy. So, I kept digging and tried not to think at all. \n\nOnce Sammy had rejoined the earth I went to find flowers. I searched for hours, but I couldn't find any. I couldn't find any that suited her. They were all so weak. They were too fragile. None of them were strong like her. So I brought her back a weed. It was strong. It had deep roots and nothing could kill it. As I laid it over the mound that was Sammy's grave I tried not to cry. I knew I was the last man on earth. And it was going to be like that for much longer than it should be. \n\nI began walking because I didn't know what else to do. After a few hours I came across some Wreckage. I had forgotten how ugly it could be. Big hulking masses of metal with jagged pieces that stuck out in every direction. There was always rust. There was always blood. I could seem them now, crowds running in fear as everything began to collapse. Why had I been able to last this long? Why couldn't I have just died with everyone else? I turned away from the Wreckage. I didn't need those memories. Not now. And so I began to walk again. \n\nAfter several weeks of walking I found a mansion. I had only stopped throughout my walk to eat, drink, or sleep. I had gathered things from the different Wreckages I had passed. This mansion wasn't truly a mansion, it just felt like one. It was brick. So it remained standing. It was definitely a bigger building, but what kept me here were the instruments, none of which I knew how to play. Once I arrived here I knew what I had to do. \n\nI walked into the room that I knew held the piano. I had been here for about a month. I had been studying the instruments from the outside. I had begun with this piano. It was beautiful and today would be the day that I began to learn. I sat at the bench and began to play. I pressed different keys and positioned my hands how the felt right. It was a slow and horrible process, but I knew what needed to be done. \n\nAfter I had begun with the piano I learned others. The guitar. The flute. The harmonica. It took so many years, but finally I felt I was ready to begin writing. I fit words together to create the final history of man. I wanted to hear it for myself. I sang out loud with different instruments. I worked day and night. Year after year. I sang. I played. I slept. I ate. I cried. \n\nTen years after Sammy killed herself I realized what I should have brought to her grave. So I set out to do just what was right for her. It took months to bring her the piano, but I did. \n\nWhen I arrived I knew exactly where she was, because where he grave  was, was now a forest of weeds. I rolled the piano to her side. Opened up as the keys shined in the sunlight. I told her why I had brought her the piano. It was strong, brave, and it would live on forever in my heart. Just like her. So I sang to her. I sang all day and all night. I sang the final history of man. I Sang untill my voice was hoarse and I could no longer go on. Then I cried. I cried because I was done. Ten years later and was finally able to keep the promise I had made. I laid down next to Sammy's grave. In her beautiful forest of weeds. I laid there and smiled. As it grew darker and colder, I remained by her side. I lost the feeling in my toes first. Then the very tip of my nose. Then my fingers. I realized it was time. I was finally done. I went to sleep by Little Sammy's side and that's where I remained. Forever. \n\n**So, I had no idea where I was going with this. I'm well aware of how choppy the middle was, but I don't want to mess with it too much more. This prompt was really awesome and had me going for a lot of ideas.

Are you a friend of Christopher Robin? He’s gone missing you see, and we’re all terribly worried looking for him. We think the backson has got him.” Pooh was blocking Thor’s path to Alfheimer.\n\n                “There’s a battle brewing among the elves and I must be present to preside over the battle.” Pooh scratched his head.\n\n                “Are elves anything like bees, because there’s a rumbly in my tummy, and this tree looks like it could have an awful lot honey! Could I come with you to awful helmet to meet these lelves?” Thor threw up his hands and stormed back into Asgaror.\n\n                “Where is Loki? Surely the trickster can do something about this bear of miniscule intelligence.” Loki was in fact, observing the traffic jam of deities forming around Yggdrasill. He was greatly amused, but had some tricks to play in Hel, and so allowed himself to be summoned to deal with the situation.\n\n                Loki turned himself into a bear, and approached Winnie the Pooh. “Friend bear, what brings you to Yggdrasill? I have lived here for many years and have found no berries.”\n\n                “No berries, bother, they go so well with honey. I’m glad to have a friend though. I’m winnie the Pooh, or just Pooh for short, pleased to meet you.” Loki could not help but be taken aback slightly at the word friend, it was a long time since anyone had thought to call him friend.\n\n                “Well friend.” Loki said again, using the word somewhat how it should be used, and only partially as a trick. “There are berries and honey a plenty in Asgaror. If you would only come down from this tree I could show you where they are.”\n\n                “Would you be so kind?” Pooh said. “I need to find Christopher Robin, but I suppose I could stop for a small smackerel of something sweet to eat.” Pooh smacking his lips together then followed Loki down from the tree. Loki had meant to lead the bear to Hel, and so continue on with his pranks, but found himself enjoying the company of the bear more and more. They talked about bees and reading over lunch, and Pooh made up a hum about himself and Loki.\n\n                “Two bears should know\n\n                How the time does go\n\n                How the time does go\n\n                On flowing\n\n                And everyone knows\n\n                That when the time does go\n\n                The bears should go\n\n                On humming”\n\n                And so Pooh taught this hum to Loki, and the two of them spent the day together, doing all the things a bear and a norse trickster god could do, until the day ended, and Pooh said.\n\n                “I must be going now.”\n\n                “Must you?” Asked Loki.\n\n                “I must, but you could come with me. I’m sure Piglet won’t mind you living with us.”\n\n                “Is this Piglet like you? Do you think he will like me?” Loki asked, finding the idea of more friends very compelling.\n\n                “Oh yes, any friend of mine is a friend of piglet’s and any friend of piglet is a friend of mine. So you shall have to meet all our friends and become acquainted.” Loki felt years of hatred and malice stripped away by the thought of living with this kind and thoughtful bear, amongst his gentle and well meaning friends. And that is how Loki cam to live.\n\nSide note: I read the entire Winnie the pooh series several times, have seen every movie, and watched every episode of both the many adventures of Winnie the pooh, and the new adventures of Winnie the pooh. I never thought I’d combine this knowledge with that of Norse mythology.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414153734","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":1,"id":"clifqu6","link_id":"t3_2k6f7i","name":"t1_clifqu6","parent_id":"t3_2k6f7i","retrieved_on":1426373787,"score":22,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":22}

Thank god there's still too much noise on their research into quantum physics, or they'd be funding the *meat* out of that Cannae drive.\"\n\nInterspecies-Contact operative Cella, just back from his first disguised interactive survey, punctuated his last statement by banging his prosthetic human fist into the ship's wall. The prop, having served its purpose, fell off the alien and finger-walked its way into the matter recycler.\n\n\"I think you're over-exaggerating a bit here, Cella,\" replied the ship. \"'They' - or more accurately, *me* - said simulations gave it a 30% chance they'd be at near-initiation levels when we next visited. It's not particularly surprising, to be honest.\"\n\n\"Not surprising? If you aren't surprised by this, why are we just now visiting?

Cella took it, but did not drink from it.\n\n\"Again, I think you're over-exaggerating the existential threat to this society,\" the ship said in its most soothing voice. \"Their larger cultures appear at first to be very rigid, but as a whole they're actually very open to change. And not only that, it's been 28 trillicycles since they've become a species-level threat to themselves, and the information I've collected suggests they gained that ability as a means to end a war of genocide. They've been teetering on the brink since then, but you and I both known from the numbers that if a species doesn't commit suicide after the first few trilicylcles with nuclear weapons, chances diminish greatly they'll do it.\"\n\nCella wasn't having it. \"But they still have so far to go - half of them are practically convinced that basic societal empathy is immoral, and on a biological level, their evolutionary path has left them with some very shaky reasoning equipment. How the hell are they going to handle entering the galactic stage to see endless numbers of no-labor, post-scarcity societies if they can't even -\"\n\n\"Cella,\" the ship said firmly, \"I know you're still upset about what happened in the Outer Clouds 20 millicycles ago.\"\n\nCella flinched, and the ship continued on, its voice a bit softer.\n\n\"We cannot go back and fix what happened there. Yes, there were similarities to this case, and yes, we could've gotten here sooner, but that society had serious flaws that even our best could not have fixed in time. We're here 12 trillicycles earlier in societal advancement than when we arrived at Outer Clouds, and better yet, I'm finding data on a number of individuals and groups that have shown the sort of mentality we'll need to foster - the sort of groups we had to seed ourselves in the failed Cloud society. We have a *chance*, this time, Cella. Don't let yourself get so paranoid that you can't see it.\"\n\nCella paused, then looked down at the glass of ammonia.

{"archived":false,"author":"Romanticon","body":"The man was silent as a ghost as he drifted along the rooftop, crouching down amid the sensors and antennae.\n\nActually, Shard reflected, that wasn't a great turn of phrase.  Most ghosts tended to be somewhat loud, rattling their chains and moaning.  If anything, they were quite obnoxious with all their noise.\n\nHe, on the other hand, was most decidedly not loud.  His boots were outfitted with chameleon soles, shifting and flexing with each step to adjust to the terrain beneath.  Each step was sure-footed, the shifting soles making sure that not a single pebble was disturbed or moved out of place.\n\nThe rest of Shard's outfit was similarly well-chosen.  He wore a tight black jacket, one sleeve cut at the elbow to reveal the flexible computer screen strapped onto his forearm.  The jacket was covered in pockets, most of them bulging with several other little high-tech gadgets that could come in handy.  Shard had a pair of skin-tight black gloves pulled on over his fingers, concealing his prints while still giving him full range of movement and the ability to activate his touch-screens.\n\nShard's head was bare, but he preferred his night pursuits that way.  As he picked his way among the weather vanes and satellite dishes, monuments to technology, he moved with purpose, carefully placing each foot.  Even though it was nearly pitch-black, the man seemed to have no trouble seeing where he was going.\n\nThat was no illusion.  Shard's eyes had their own augments, helping him make his way without a single step out of place.  Of course, those augmentations weren't cheap, even with his own considerable modding skill.\n\nThat, he thought to himself, was one of the reasons he was up on top of this roof.\n\nHis destination lay just ahead.  The door was recessed back into the shadows, but Shard's eyes could see the glowing yellow halo surrounding the frame.  That put the man on edge.  He hesitated, slowing down and carefully checking each footstep before shifting his weight over.\n\nFinally, Shard was standing in front of the doorway, gazing up at the yellow halo around it, visible to his eyes only.  The handle was right in front of him, beckoning for him to try it, to see whether it was open.\n\nShard didn't touch it.\n\nInstead, he lifted up his left wrist, running his fingers over the flexible display attached to his arm.  A few touches, and it sprang to muted life, displaying readouts and outputs in night-friendly green.  Shard scrolled through a few menus, tapping on different buttons, until he found the options he wanted.\n\nWith the program set, Shard dipped his other hand into a pocket, pulling out a handful of what looked like small marbles.  He held them in the hand attached to the screen, waited for the portable computer to recognize and connect with the objects, and then activated his program.  After a beep, he closed his hand around the small spheres - and then tossed them forward.\n\nThe spheres flew to their points on the door, sticking to the metal frame.  Shard couldn't keep his grin off his face as the glowing yellow pattern in his eyes shifted, now bounded by his new additions.\n\nHe reached out and grabbed the handle, gave it a twist, and waited, feeling his heart leap up into his throat.\n\nThe glowing yellow field of electricity around the door didn't change.  Shard's grin widened, and, more silent than the average ghost, he slipped inside.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414394995","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clkyntf","link_id":"t3_2kftzd","name":"t1_clkyntf","parent_id":"t3_2kftzd","retrieved_on":1426330449,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

'You insult me by even making such a low offer. A kick up the arse, that's what I'll give you.'\n\n'Okay, how about 40%? That's closing in on halfway right there.'\n\nSatan sighed. 'I must say, you are the first person I have met in all my days who wished to sell a portion of his soul to me.'\n\n'Hey, it'll mean I still have some leftover for later, doesn't it?' said Alan. 'Now, stop avoiding the question and tell me how much my soul is worth.'\n\nSatan tapped some numbers into a calculator. 'Not enough for what you want, I'm afraid.'\n\n'Fine, I'll go to 45%, but you're pushing it,' said Alan, smiling. 'You're within damning distance of the halfway line with that number. Go on, take it.'\n\n'Look, if you're going to be so smarmy about it, we can forget this deal!' shouted Satan, slamming his fist down on the table. His eyes glowed with anger like burning coals.\n\n'Yeah, yeah, save it for the Apocalypse,' said Alan, raising his hands. '47%.'\n\nSatan locked eyes with him. '48%'\n\n'49%, and that's my final offer,' said Alan, sitting back and steepling his fingers. 'Take it or leave it.'\n\nSatan glowered at him. 'Fine,' he said eventually. He snapped his fingers and a yellowing contract appeared on the desk in front of Alan in a burst of yellow flame. 'Just sign on the dotted line at the bottom and let's be done with it.'\n\nAlan did so with his expensive fountain pen. The contract disappeared again as soon as he lifted the nib from the paper. Satan stood up and leaned over Alan's desk.\n\n'A pleasure doing business with you,' he said, showing his sharp yellow teeth. Then he gathered his cloak around himself and disappeared with a flourish of impressive blue-green fire.\n\nAlan sat back and waited for his prize. It wasn't long in coming.

Then he reached in and pulled out a large bacon sandwich.\n\nBest 49% of his soul he had ever spent.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414458781","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cllpnuz","link_id":"t3_2kiiir","name":"t1_cllpnuz","parent_id":"t3_2kiiir","retrieved_on":1426316963,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"whatisabaggins55","body":"I stepped off the gangway and looked back at the colossal spaceship hovering above us. It was a Nova-class spaceliner, almost fifteen miles long. And that wasn't even the largest ship the Confederacy had to offer. Not by a long shot.\n\nI turned and looked around eagerly. The world of Kleithan was regularly quoted as a paradise world. But then, I considered most Confederate planets to be practically Nirvana at this stage. Humanity had advanced so far in terms of technology and society, almost everywhere they colonised was improved massively.\n\n'This way, Ms. Seguya,' said my companion drone Loraithel. It was a small floating golden sphere, about the size of an apple. It didn't look like much, but I knew that Loraithel was more than capable of taking on a tank and winning. No, scratch that, ten tanks at least. This was a Confederacy drone we were talking about, after all.\n\nI followed the drone through the crowds into the spaceport. The roof was all glass and gracefully curving arches that looked almost too thin and delicate to hold up such a large structure. Beneath the glass ceiling, aliens, humans, and droids alike walked, slithered, or flew to and fro. You could sit there for an hour and still see amazing new creatures and machines walking past you.\n\nOnce outside, I could see the multicoloured buildings of Kleithan's capital, Ysera, stretching in all directions. The city alone covered an area equivalent to that of a small country, back on Earth. In the Confederacy, however, it was considered a modest colony at best. I had seen entire worlds covered with the glorious alien-human architecture of the Confederacy. This was rather small in comparison.\n\nI waited for a few seconds while Loraithel hailed a hovercar to take us into the city centre. A moment later, the vehicle dropped down from the sky to land neatly beside me, its rear door popping open automatically. It looked like an old-style 21st century car, but with antigravity plates on the underside and antigravity turbines where the wheels would have been. Smiling, I got in while Loraithel directed my two hovercases into the trunk. Then the drone flew into the car and we soared into the sky.\n\nUnusually for a public taxi, this hovercar was being piloted by an actual living creature rather than by computer: in this case, a small grey alien with a big head called an Iotan. They were the first race to be contacted by mankind, and so had spread quickly throughout the universe alongside us. They had also been responsible for helping to develop one of the Confederacy's greatest assets: the unimaginably powerful supercomputers known as Nodes.\n\nI looked out through the windscreen. In the near distance, at the epicentre of the entire city, sat the half-kilometre wide mirrored dome where the Kleithan Node resided. From there, it controlled everyday amenities such as water and electricity supplies, as well as more specialised services like public transport, agricultural quotas, spaceport control, military forces and law enforcement.\n\nSome Nodes were given command of a single planet, but some of the bigger ones controlled multiple planets, space stations, or even entire solar systems. They were immensely intelligent, able to hold conversations with billions of the citizens under their control simultaneously and effortlessly. They were omniscient and omnipotent within their domains.\n\nIn only a few minutes, we were descending towards a large open plaza between a pair of colossal skysc#BADWORDS#s. Their flanks glittered with thousands of tiny lights that created rainbows of colour down the sides of the buildings.\n\nI paid the driver by swiping my wrist beneath the scanner that he held out. The chip in my arm would automatically subtract the fare from my bank account. The draft as the car took off again ruffled my pixie cut a little as I set off across the plaza, Loraithel at my shoulder. The two hover suitcases floated a few inches off the ground as they followed me like a pair of faithful dogs.\n\nI didn't head for my hotel immediately, even though it was right in front of me. Instead, I allowed Loraithel to wirelessly contact the Node subsystem controlling the building and gave it remote control of my baggage. The two suitcases suddenly rocketed away at top speed with a low whine, leaving me and Loraithel to keep going towards the shopping district.\n\nConfederacy shops were so much more interesting than old 21st century shops. For one thing, they had much more amazing products on sale. The first store I walked into was filled with clothing of all shapes, sizes, and colours. They even had Martian cloth, a rare commodity all the way from the Red Planet itself. There were even Chameleocloth, the amazing material that could change colour to whatever you pleased.\n\nI avoided the tight but comfortable one-piece suits I usually wore and headed to the local section. Every Confederate planet had its own unique style of local clothing; no two were exactly the same. I made a hobby of purchasing at least one item of clothing from every planet I visited, as a memento.\n\nKleithan garb was quite simple: a stylish tunic that reached down to your knees with a lighter pair of trousers underneath and a pair of tall boots. A long pointed hat completed the outfit. I bought a lovely green one and changed into it in the store's changing rooms, I was so eager to wear it.\n\nThe alien stalls in the marketplace sold even more exotic wares. There were the war-loving Maktons selling their distinctive brand of hi-tech weaponry, and some four-armed Solcadians playing their quadroguitars. Multicoloured lights flashed everywhere like tiny fairies. Every now and then, a hovercar would roar overhead carrying more people in for the festivities.\n\nThe sky was dark and filled with stars as Loraithel and I made our way into Celebration Square, the largest open space in the city. It was crowded with people, aliens, cyborgs, androids, drones, and biomorphs. I found a good vantage point near the very centre and tapped my left forearm.\n\nA green holographic display glowed into life on my skin, being projected there by the implant beneath. I typed a few replies to messages I had received on the small stylized keyboard, then checked the digital clock hologram on the back of my hand. It was time.\n\nI looked up in time to hear the signature roar as ten Navelox fighters shot in over our heads and soared upwards at unimaginable speed, pursued by loud cheers from the watching crowd. There was a huge explosion of fireworks above us as they broke formation, setting the sky exploding with lights and colour.\n\nIt was good to be a citizen of the Confederacy.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414686257","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cloac9d","link_id":"t3_2ksa61","name":"t1_cloac9d","parent_id":"t3_2ksa61","retrieved_on":1426273106,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

I loved her, I mean she's my MOM, but she just hated listening or something.\n\"Okay, why?  You give me a good reason and I'll get you some.\"  She stood there looking expectantly.  \nI couldn't tell her.  It was man stuff.  I had to keep her safe and happy.  Scared isn't happy.  I could hear my voice go small, \"I can't tell you...\"\n\"Then no more.  You've already got more than you need.\"  I could hear her as she walked away \"I swear he's trying to sweat himself to death.\"\n\nI walked back into my room, closed the door, and almost started crying.  Then I saw dad's picture on my nightstand.  \"I'm the man of the house now.  Can't cry.  Men can cry but not when they got stuff to do!\"  It was what dad said once when I asked him if he cries when away.\nSo I began getting ready for that night.  \n\nMom was really cool about it when I asked to move my bed.  I had thought if the bed was farther from the door, it would take them longer to get out, and I'd have more chances to stop em.  \n\nThe pillows were easy, but the blankets had to be folded right or they'd get over or under 'em. Thankfully, mom kept the big beach towels in my room.  I had sprayed those with some of dad's cologne, and they worked really well.  They were AFRAID of dad.  That's why it was so hard for me.  That and my best troops where in the ba#BADWORDS#t.\n\nMr. Wiggles (our dog) caught that the first night dad was gone.  It's why he had to go to the vet the next day.  So I put my best action figures on the steps.  I always checked on em the next day, and they were holding.  I think more came from under the bed cause they knew I was the leader.\n\nI had arranged my remaining troops at the weak spots.  Weak spots I wouldn't HAVE if mom had given me more blankets.  Mom didn't think to much of it when I asked for my old stuffed animals back.  She asked if it was cause a dad being gone.  I told her yes, cause dad said not to lie.\n\nThe troops'd be waking up soon.  They got to sleep during the day cause the monsters came at night.  I took lots of naps.  So while they slept, I got the last two things ready.  From my closet, I got my old bat.  It was a little small for me now, cause dad was gone so long last time and when he'd come back it'd been to late for baseball.  It worked out though, cause now I could swing it one handed.  Finally, I reached under my pillow and got out the new glove.  Dad had given it to me right before he left.  He'd shown me how to put oil on it so it didn't crack.  He said we'd play again when he got back, no matter what.  So I sat down and oiled it just like he showed me, and when I was done it shined.\n\nI heard my troops start to stir.  The newest ones always woke up first.  I got a few pokemon upstairs, all 4 of the turtles woke up together, the lego guys who went straight to building more defenses, my spiderman and batman that never got along, and that one digimon Aunt Sue got me cause she's old.  All my GI Joes where in the ba#BADWORDS#t.\nThen came my old stuffed animals.  The bunny shook off it's fur and its ears went all floppy, the weird pillow guy fell forward and yelled for help, the husky we got on vacation who tried to bark but couldn't.  The last one to wake up was the oldest, and my second-in-command.  Mr. Gumpus ((http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2hrtrg/wp_as_youve_slept_the_teddy_bear_you_adore_has/)) was the teddy bear that dad gave me when I was just a baby.  He had patches in his fur and he'd been repaired alot, but dad had said that Mr. Gumpus had protected him when he was growing up.  Now he helped me protect mom and Sabrina (my younger sister. she was alright i guess) from the monsters.\n\"Are you ready Mr. Gumpus?  We don't have much time left,\" I asked as I put on my glove and readied the bat.\n\"I'll have to be.  We'll keep 'em safe Junior, I promise,\"  Mr. Gumpus lifted his swords and turned back to the bed.  \"All right everybody.  We can do this.  We take care of as many as we can and any that get past us, Junior gets.  We can't let to many get past tho otherwise they'll rush him and get out the door.  It's just like every night, we'll get through to sunrise.\"\nMr. Gumpus was the only one that could talk and he would never tell me why none of the others could.  It didn't matter much though, cause everyone always fought with everything they had.\n\nThe room got colder as the first monsters began to creep out.  It was a big group, and they rushed the lego people.  It took them a while to get past cause the lego's where really kicking butt tonight (probably because I'd gotten more lego's yes#BADWORDS#ay) and they got slowed down more by the blankets.  The pokemon and digimon started then, screaming out their special attacks.  The monsters kept coming, like every night.  The turtles would go wherever we were losing worst to slow them down and thin them out.\nAfter a few minutes, three faster ones got past everybody.  It was up to me for these, but I was ready.  I had to be.  The bat was harder to swing lefty, but it still whistled through the air as I hit one by swinging left to right.  I couldn't smash them on the ground cause it'd make to much noise and mom would come in, and that'd be bad.  The glove tho was quiet.  I smashed the next one to come up with a good WHUMP.  The last one thought it had gotten me.  It's inky black form leapt through the air at me, darkness dripping off behind it.  That's when I swatted it out of the sky with the glove.  As it flew back towards the bed, it smacked another one in the FACE right as it was about to attack the husky.  \"HURRAH!\" Yelled Mr. Gumpus as his silver swords stopped two more.\nIt was a good night so far.  We could make it.  When dad got home he'd be so proud.\n\nAnd that was when I heard Mr. Wiggles howling from downstairs.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414719239","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clorvjj","link_id":"t3_2kti8v","name":"t1_clorvjj","parent_id":"t3_2kti8v","retrieved_on":1426264041,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

And yes, I reflectively could admit, I was so addicted to gambling that I'd rather take an infinitely small chance at winning big than a guarantee of winning slightly less big.\n\nNow, as the television repeated itself - \"3, 4, 14, 26, 29, bonus number 18!\" - I stared down numbly at my ticket.\n\nI was a millionaire. No, scratch that, a millionaire was someone with just a million dollars. I was a multi-millionaire. A $17,300,000aire, to be exact, payed either in a lump sum or over twenty years as I pleased.\n\nThank God I hadn't accepted the money, although now I wondered how the man had known I was going to win tonight...\n\n\"Excuse me.\" A melodious and whispery voice spoke into my small flat's living room.\n\nI jumped, screamed, crumpled the ticket in a sudden iron fist, nearly bolted towards the door. The only thing blocking my escape was the muscle bound man standing in front of it.\n\n\"Excuse me.\" He repeated, and I marveled briefly at such a feminine voice coming from such a slab of masculinity. \"I just need a moment of your time.\"\n\nHe - she? - stepped into my flat, allowing me to see that curiously, the door was still shut and deadbolted behind him.\n\n\"Twentieth century andorless one, low income, New York skylight behind. Acceptatious.\" It looked at me, then suddenly barked out at me in a rough, deep, raspy voice.\n\n\"I'm Detective Samuels with the US FBI IRS! We're dispatched to investigate your su#BADWORDS#ious lottery winnings!\"\n\nHe glowered at me, took another step forward. \"My first question, curmudgeon. Who is the current president?\"\n\nI stammered, my mind completely blank, and I spoke the first presidential name I could think of. \"Uh... Nixon?\"\n\nHe stopped, tilted his head at me. \"Next question, lucky punk. Name an unforgettable celebrity that just had their first minute of fame, whom history shant forget.\"\n\nWhat sort of question was that... again, I spoke immediately, in a panic. \"Justin... Bieber, I think? Maybe?\"\n\nHis arm lowered to his side, rippling against the black fabric ominously. \"Last chance, Beaver Cleaver. What is the current stock value of Wal-Mart Incorporated?\"\n\nI backed away, protesting. \"How the hell would I know? Who the hell are you?!\"\n\nThe pain #BADWORDS#ed in a strange way, as first my feet dissolved, then my legs... slowly, up to my head, then the pain stopped at last. I wondered if I were dead, but slowly realized I could still see, and move even, somewhat. I spotted the ticket fluttering down and latched onto it, rolling over to try and intercept it before it hit the ground.\n\nA jar slammed over me, blocking my route. The man grabbed the ticket before it could touch my dingy carpet, put it perfunctorily into a small case at his side. I could read the word 'Evidence' on it in flowery script... then I couldn't... then a moment later, I could again.\n\n\"Suspected Time Exploiter captured.\" He murmured out loud, once again using the fluttery voice. \"The suspect failed the Tripled Time Situational Awareness Confirmation Quiz, as was predicted, and has been reduced to the standard prisoner transportation mode for his trial. He will be permitted to speak at his trial, and no sooner than then, per protocol to avoid further temporal contamination. A trace has been initiated to determine the extent of all quantum fallout from his activities.\"\n\nHe hefted the jar - my jar, I suppose - and began carrying me towards the door. As we passed my mirror, I saw myself.\n\nAn eyeball in a jar looked back at me, looking as though it wished to scream.\n\nWe vanished.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414725118","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clouvh3","link_id":"t3_2kttzq","name":"t1_clouvh3","parent_id":"t3_2kttzq","retrieved_on":1426262605,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":8}

Never could I have predicted what I saw that day.\n\nWe were running through diagnostics with HQ from the ground. I was at a console by a window. I remember that moment exactly. Power was running low and we had to reposition the solar panels to draw more energy from the sun. The transmission cut out. I had no idea why, but then I noticed something out the window. A bright flash consumed  what I could only imagine was Washington DC. I started to gasp as multiple flashes appeared all across the United States. Seconds later flashes appeared all over the entire world. It was so bright I couldn't see anything out the window. I was still in disbelief.

It was a soup she'd made before, dozens of times, from the sad carcass of the Saturday chicken after Sunday chicken curry and Monday chicken pasta. This was the first time it had exploded though. There was carpet of grey dust over the olive green tiles; it turned the pallid brown of unfinished tea into a sooty black. It gripped at her lungs as she coughed on the floor. The detonation of her dinner had smashed her against the wall, and now she rose to a crawl, blind and deaf, retching the fine grit out of her throat. Above her, October's retriever puppy was grinning stupidly from the calendar through the smog. \n\nWhere she had stood, some mighty hand had burst through the ground, gripped at her oven, clenched at and crushed it. It had broken metal and stone and ceramic and torn viciously back into the floor below, leaving a great dark fissure hanging in the air. Her head felt like an old tire, worn and over pressure, that had run across a nail in the road and burst open. But she wiped the dirt from her eyes onto the sleeve of her overalls and looked up. The laceration loomed above her. As she stared at it, she saw in the black shimmers of light she could not focus on, like a scene reflected in drops of falling mercury. Around the edges of the tatter, wisps of shadow were curling off and falling to the floor. They drifted towards her, sinister leaves on the wind in a still room.\n\nThough her thoughts buzzed with pain and confusion and her vision was blurred by the impact and debris still hanging in the air, she gazed at the fissure and her breathing slowed. The dust had settled before she moved again. One quivering arm was placed ahead, and she shifted her weight from tired hip to tired shoulder and pushed a knee forward. The fissure still hung, placid and expectant, so she decided to move closer again; another hand, another knee. And again. It was within reach now, and she lifted her arm tenderly. As her finger brushed against the black, ice rolled down her back, waves from the fissure raced down her torso, hands gripped all over her skin, nails dug in and yanked hard. She was thrown into the void. She was sick, there was acid in her mouth, she was blind again and spinning and burning. Her ears were ringing. \n\nHer body was crumpled against the wall again, in the same small kitchen, with the same dust and shattered oven. The same dark tatter hanging tranquil in the corner. September’s poodle grinned stupidly from the calendar through the smog. \n\n---\n\nThe last room she would ever see was as clean and bare as the last hall she would ever walk down, and the last room she would ever sleep in. She was strapped tight to the steel chair, gazing at the whitewashed concrete. Her last day was not much different to the days before it: a rush of strong men in black suits, cold men in white lab coats. They moved briskly but had the speed of a routine followed regularly, not the haste of a group thrown into chaos. Her last thoughts were not much different to those of the day before either. “how did they find me?

Obviously saw I'd switched off comms and clambered his way up to 'chat'.\n\n\"Pip, there are 40 billion of them, they out-number every single one of us 4-to-1.

They were running towards me from the opposite end of the stadium.\n\n\"Those people are put forward because they have some terminal illness or -\"\n\n\"Ving. It's a 30-foot drop back down into maintenance from where you're dangling. Shut up, go back down, I'll watch, wait and make notes.\"\n\nOne of the man-shaped blobs disappeared in a wink, replaced by a tiny geyser of red. A shadow passed over me as I watched, the Voline gladiator swooping down from its perch. Huge and heavy, with even more limbs than the basic, unmodded Voline. It looked like a dragonfly had #BADWORDS# an M1 Abrams tank, then clamped a few extra legs and arms under the thorax. It looked like death. Pure, inhuman oblivion.\n\nThe hiss of the Voline crowd raised a few decibels and dropped an octave in pitch, dread poured from it as it hovered maybe 30 feet above the arena floor, air beneath it shimmering with ramjet heat. It waited stationary. Watching to see if its prey would make some charge. It waited. I waited. The crowd tensed and quieted, some insolent Voline behind me jeered in their odd buzz-talk, sounding like a kazoo's wail.\n\nI went to machinespeed, if only to silence the crowd's din, as even the tinniest of Voline hiss became the scraping of two glaciers. Almost all motion at a standstill, I watched as the Voline's hovering machine-form flicked instruments made tiny adjustments and altered control surfaces far too quickly for any human - or unaugged Voline - to perceive at their crawling meatspeed.\n\nWeeks might have passed in that mode, time is odd when perceiving at that speed, then the Voline moved. Rapid, even to my suit's pseudo-eyes operating many times faster than a human's ever could, it whipped forward and swooped low enough to almost touch the arena floor, articulated insect-legs scrunching to avoid scraping the smoothness of its surface. I magnified my view until it was as though I was peeping from between those legs, at the surprisingly unreactive faces of these soon-to-be corpses. To them, at their speed, this Voline was likely no more than a blur, their brains hadn't even time to stare in wide-eyed terror.\n\nIf the combat core implant could send nerve signals to my face at that speed, I would have winced for them. One out-stretching leg of the creature-craft caught a combatant in the face and shattered his skull, sending a spray of blood into the air that hastened then slowed as air resistance sapped it of momentum and it froze motionless in the air, making the bloody scene into some kind of bizarre modern art ode to the headshot. The Voline's leg swept through brain, skull, upper spine - pieces splintering and twisting through clear, innocent air.\n\nOne forelimb repositioned and then twitched as it fired a magnetically accelerated shell into the gut of a combatant a little further on - the pure speed of the impact causing a small explosion in the mushrooming instant it arrived, followed by a very brief pause (at my hugely overclocked speed) and then a detonation that transformed the combatant - still staring forward, stock still - into a shower of ashes and altered carbon. \n\nThe last remaining combatant was to be offered the greatest cruelty and ignominy, two forelimbs flicked blades outward as the Voline approached, the clear intent was to nick off the combatant's limbs with scalpel-like precision and swiftness. This, in Voline culture, due to their use of wings, legs and proboscus in communication and intercourse, would be the greatest shame and indignity.\n\nI switched back down to human speed and closed my eyes. The crowd was frenzied. A chime indicated the fight was over. I breathed in deeply through my nose and opened my eyes again. Sweeper-drones coasted just above the arena floor and pushed the offal into a sluice-like gutter that lined the rim of the arena floor. I thought for a moment a waft of blood and faecal matter rushed into my nostrils. I gagged and cleared my throat. \n\nA red light on my helmet-bar went winked from red to amber. An announcer was chattering something. Comms still off, I could guess what Ving would be saying. The Voline was already back in place on his side of the arena. I breathed out again. I looked upward one last time at the blue above. I breathed in. The light went green.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414867542","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clq4ui0","link_id":"t3_2kz5r0","name":"t1_clq4ui0","parent_id":"t1_clq4t8f","retrieved_on":1426240795,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}

And so our dream was ill, our baths were scarce and our hunger increased. All of our thinking was limited to interpretation of his command and so the creation of any idea was not something we conceived.\n   We all uses to have lives. We all used to have names. \n   He took me a night very long ago. I had left my family at home for work. And in the dim light of a moonless night he lurked. It was not him who kidnapped me but it was in him that we lived. It was by him that we lived. We all felt forsaken at first, but we all embraced him as hope started escaping our souls. He turned us this way.\n   Some were sold quickly, but some of us helped him orient newcomers. Some of us helped him be embraced by them. Eventually he kept me. I was glad I wasn't being sold because that could easily mean death by organ trafficants. So my will was done and I remained with him.\n    And so you would imagine how I felt the day they got him. I don't know what his flaw was, but it was a fulminating one. My desolation was too much. I felt anger in every nerve, every bone, every muscle left. The two cops found me curled on the floor sobbing in rage. I swear I heard one say: \"I think he used to be human\".","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414963414","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clr3m3t","link_id":"t3_2l2hqq","name":"t1_clr3m3t","parent_id":"t3_2l2hqq","retrieved_on":1426224333,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":false,"author":"varcityjets","body":"“Did we get them all?” Quickster asked.\n“No,” Rex answered, “We just scared them off.”  A sense of joy went over Tyler as he thought, could it be over already?  His joy was quickly taken away as Rex continued, “Alright men, let’s split up.  Gloan go with Eldaner, Quicks go with Ty, and I’ll hunt alone!”  \nTyler and Quickster were assigned to go to the right side.  They seemed to have walked far until they heard some men talking.  Quickster climbed up on the bolder ahead of them to scout it out.  He motioned to Tyler that there were three of them hiding.  An easy kill for two veteran soldiers but this was Tyler and Quickster.  Both were skilled but none had ever defeated an enemy one on one with a sword.  \n“You go around back alright?” Quicks whispered.  Tyler just nodded and snuck around the area where the three Armonti were hiding.  He slowly unsheathed his sword to avoid detection.  Tyler was trying to come up with different scenarios of how he could surprise the men and kill them without a fight.  He knew it was a cowardly thought but this was for his survival!  The first kill’s the hardest Tyler thought.  He knew it was only a matter of time before one of the three men noticed him.  \n“It’s time”  He said to himself.  Tyler peaked around the bolder and saw the three men huddled around each other.\n“They won’t even see me comin’” He said to himself.  He realized that from where he was standing, he would have to fight them from the low ground; a could-be fatal mistake.  If I could just get to the other side of this bolder, Tyler thought, I would have the high ground.  He silently stepped back, making sure to face the Armonti the whole time in case one of them turned around and spotted him.  It was then that Tyler heard the sound of little rocks falling off a bolder behind him.  He turned around just in time to see another Armonti soldier running toward him!  The next moments happened so fast that it seemed to be a blur.  Sword hit sword and the sound of the clash brought chills down Tyler’s spine.  Again the soldier swung his sword and again Tyler parried the blow.  The man tried to bring his sword down overtop but Tyler was just as fast and swung his sword up.  The two locked in mid-air and it was a battle of strength.  The soldier was obviously stronger and Tyler realized he was not going to win if he remained locked in.  Without thinking, Tyler took his left hand and grabbed his enemy’s wrist.  He pushed with all his might at an angle so he could use the enemy’s strength against him.  When he felt the man’s arms start to slide to the right, Tyler pulled his sword away, straightened his arm, and stabbed at the heart.  His sword sliced through the steel armor and he could feel his sword slice flesh and then bone.  Blood then squirted out as Tyler tried to pull his sword loose, but it was stuck in the man’s ribcage.  He couldn’t help but to look up at the man.  He had already dropped his sword to the ground.  His face was pale and he was mumbling.\n“I don’t want to, I don’t want to…” He was saying quietly over and over.  He then fell \nonto his back and continued, “Please, I don’t want to, please…” Tears began to roll down Tyler’s cheeks.  He knew the rules of war, and he knew he would have to kill.  But he thought they would die sooner than this!  Tyler kept pulling on his sword but it would not come free.  He was forced to watch this man’s fate, as he had decided it.  The man had stopped talking now; he just lay there on the floor.  Tyler looked at his eyes and it appeared as though any sparkle that existed had disappeared.  He was dead.  Tyler then stepped on the man’s chest and pulled out his sword.  It was only then he realized how bloody his hands were.  He had wanted to just drop to his knees and stay there until the battle had ended.  However, the sound of footsteps snapped Tyler back to reality.  The other soldiers!! he thought and he climbed the bolder that his dead enemy had charged from.  No sooner had he reached the top than the other soldiers reached their comrade’s body.  Tyler was too high up to hear what the men were saying but they were clearly scared.  The larger of the three seemed to be in charge as he was giving orders to the other two.  Tyler’s fears were soon realized when he noticed another group of soldiers come out from hiding and meet up with the others.  Tyler could only see eight soldiers down there.  As poorly trained as these were, eight-on-one was poor odds for him.  He started to hear the men cheer as he saw another group of soldiers join them, however this group of four had a prisoner with them.. After a few moments, Tyler realized it was Quickster!  A knot filled his stomach.  He had to save him!  This was his closest friend that was a soldier.  Quicks was putting up a hell of a fight, even though he was captured.  He was tied up with his hands behind his back.  It appeared as though the leader was asking him a question but Quicks just spat in the man’s face.  The leader then pulled out a knife from his belt and raised it to strike at Quick’s throat.\n“NO!!”\nIt took Tyler a few moments before he realized that he was the one who had yelled it.  The sound had just seemed to escape him but it was too late to take it back.  All twelve soldiers were staring up at the bolder now.  Tyler dropped onto his stomach but he knew they had already spotted him.  He could hear a man shout and then rocks crumble in the distance as some soldiers climbed after him.  Tyler closed his eyes.  He could see all of his friends: Max, Eddie, David, Curtis, Hanna, and Maria.  He envisioned them being captured as Quickster had.  He went back and thought of Maria being captured.  Anger filled his veins.  His hand tightened around his sword and his senses were clearer.  He could hear the soldiers climbing toward him but they were too late; he had no fears.\n“Not her!” He yelled loud enough so they would hear.  He opened his eyes and jumped off the edge of the bolder, sword in the air.  As he fell, he landed on a soldier and stabbed him in his gut.  Tyler rolled off him and hit the floor.  His impact was not as painful due to the other soldier.  He felt some pain in his ankle but he had no time to react to it as the other soldiers were charging him.  Tyler pulled his sword out of the man that was now dead and rolled to the right, narrowly missing another soldier’s sword.  He swung at the man’s face and slashed right through as the soldier screamed and fell to the floor.  Tyler saw a sword in the corner of his right eye and turned to parry the blow.  The hit caused both men to fall backwards and to the floor.  As the soldier rolled over, Tyler grabbed his dagger and flung it at him.  It pierced the man’s helmet and skull as he lay there motionless.  Tyler quickly rolled to his left where he saw another soldier.  He slashed at the man’s legs, taking out both knees.  The man screamed in horror and Tyler swung his sword upwards and sliced his throat.  He then rolled up on his feet only to be met by two more soldiers!  Tyler was strictly on defense as he parried the men’s attacks.  Thankfully, four of the soldiers were still climbing down from the bolder and therefore gave him time.  Tyler caught both soldiers lunging to his right and he slashed to the left across both their stomachs.  Both yelled and the man on the right fell down.  Tyler was focusing on attacking now as he swung down upon the other man’s head.  His screams stopped as he too dropped dead.  The remaining two soldiers ran to the bolder to await their comrades.  \n\tTyler cut the rope that bound Quickster’s hands before he went on the attack again.  His stomach was telling him to run away but his body wouldn’t budge.  He couldn’t get the image of Maria being tortured out of his mind.  And these men would pay for it.  He attacked the first man and easily unarmed him and cut his throat.  The second solder ran for the attack as Tyler stood ready.  This one was a better fighter than the others as they were attacking and blocking for a while.  Tyler recognized him as the leader who was giving orders to the others.  Neither of them seemed to have the upper hand which made Tyler a little nervous.  The soldier swung at his head but Tyler ducked in time as the sword missed and hit the bolder.  The impact forced the man to drop his weapon and Tyler went for the kill.  His arms were starting to get red from all the men’s blood he had collected.  \n\tSuddenly, pain filled Tyler’s left soldier and he dropped to the floor.  He rolled over to see one of the soldiers regrouping his sword from the swing.  Tyler was numb from his left shoulder down.  The man went for another swing but he parried the hit with his good arm.  The soldier seemed to be heading for another swing but an arrow struck him in the neck and he fell dead.  Tyler got up and saw another soldier fall with an arrow in his chest.  Quickster was standing across the field with his bow and arrows.  As another soldier got off the bolder and ran for Quicks, Tyler blindsided him with a blow to the head.  The man took two more steps before he fell on his knees and then to his face.  The last soldier jumped down and ran for Tyler this time!  Tyler went for a stab to the chest and as he did so, one of Quickster’s arrows pierced the man’s head.  Tyler shoved him to the floor and was ready to attack.  He looked around and realized that that was it, everyone was dead.  The horn of Luvida was blowing in the distance which meant one thing, Victory!  Tyler dropped to his knees and stared at the pile of dead bodies he had created.  This is war he thought.  And he was now a warrior.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1414985127","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clrelyk","link_id":"t3_2l2p1l","name":"t1_clrelyk","parent_id":"t3_2l2p1l","retrieved_on":1426219084,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":false,"author":"Qedem","body":"Everyone has their part to play in the Great Invasion -- the war that will prove that humans have the most advanced civilization in our galaxy. Our victory was assured, no one had any doubts. Unfortunately, my job was so far removed from battle that the Great Invasion might as well have been an idle fantasy. I was a birther. That was my job, and I liked doing it. When the artificial womb delivered a baby, It was my job to remove any imperfections and enhance its abilities. \n\n*beep, beep*\n\nThere was the alarm, the womb was ready to release its newborn citizen. I rushed to the incubation chamber, where there were eight ellipsoidal pods, each roughly half my size. The two far pods had a red, flashing beacon on them. Twins? Who would have guessed? I ran to the pods and watched as two 3 feet tall organisms slid into them. \n\n*Two infants, one boy and one girl have been born. November 1st, 2074. 7:33 PM. Please perform the necessary operations.*\n\nI knew what to do. I had done this 10 times a day for years. One had a dangling object between it's legs. The other did not. I took the one without the dangling thing, the _girl_, I think. That was the easy one. I took it to the bench, gave it a quick shot and waited for a few minutes while the hole between its legs closed a little. Once I made sure it had sufficient space to urinate, I pressed a button on the collar of my shirt and said, \"Tray. Come get this one. It's ready.\"\n\nThen it was time for the other one. The _boy_. These operations were always involved. I took it to the bench, pulled out a scalpel and went to work. I had never understood why 50% of the babies had this imperfection. I had been told that if it was not removed, it would cause significant discomfort later in life and could render an individual useless if even a small amount of force was applied to the area. I had asked about it before, but the higher-ups just said it was part of the process and couldn't be removed before birth. Interestingly, those with the imperfection almost always had a lower intelligence, but higher strength than those without it. I didn't understand why the great artificial womb couldn't remove these beings altogether, especially considering physical strength is not useful in a combat situation, while intelligence was. \n\nRegardless, once the operation was finished, I gave it a shot and pressed the button on my collar again. \"Tony. Pick this one up. It's ready.\"\n\nWhen Tony came, he pressed a button on his way out, initiating the naming of the babies.\n\n*This evening, two healthy males, Ted and Sam, were born. Please welcome them with open arms.*\n\nI wondered idly to myself weather there was a real difference between the two babies before another alarm went off. I didn't have time to think. I had a few more males to deliver.

I would sometimes pretend to be sick and just spend the entire day in bed, doing nothing but staring at the ceiling and feeling sorry for myself. Now, it’s like I’m too depressed to even care. I get up out of my bed like a corpse arising from the grave, going through my morning routine as I’ve done every miserable day of my life. Gotta go downstairs, gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal. I see everything, but time feels like a blur; the long seconds keep ticking on and on as my family rushes around me, never once stopping to talk to me, like the extras in the background of my life. I think sometimes maybe they just don’t know how to help me, but then I come to my senses and realize they stopped caring long ago. Gotta get down to the bus stop.\n\nI saw some old friends from school drive by as I was waiting for the bus in the rain. We’d had a lot of good times together, and we’d all been a very close group once. Before I started pushing them away. Before they stopped caring. Perhaps out of pity they stopped, but not before drenching me with a puddle of street sludge and rainwater.\n\nI thought for an interminably long time about whether I should take their charity and sit in the front or the back seat. Hell, I thought, it’s raining, and the back seat’s the only one open anyways. I climbed in, and the car fell into an awkward silence.\n\nFinally, one of my friends tried to break the silence, “It’s Friday!” she announced, in desperate search of some topic of conversation. Probably to make me feel more comfortable, I guess. It didn’t work.\n\n“Yeah, looking forward to the weekend,” the driver replied.\n\nEverybody’s looking forward to the weekend.\n\nExcept me.\n\n[Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415083668","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clsgxkp","link_id":"t3_2l7n0w","name":"t1_clsgxkp","parent_id":"t3_2l7n0w","retrieved_on":1426200966,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

More of a grimace than a smile now, 14 years in this sand caked town had run its course, drying his already leathery skin until it groaned and broke at every move. \n\nHe hadn’t always looked this way. Even Charleston’s winters with her chapping winds that could freeze a man’s face in minuets were easily enough overcome beside a fire and a woman or two. \n\n*And there’s my problem.*\n\nPut simply, he had always wanted more, needed more. It’s not that he didn’t have food on the table. A cobbler for a father, albeit not the town’s greatest, had provided a roof over his family’s head. But when he had read the paper that morning he knew his time in Massachusetts had come to an end, and so at 19 he had stolen what money he could find and left without a warning. \n\nSpitting in the sand, The boss could almost laugh.\n\nGold, what a load of horse #BADWORDS#. Only gold I’ve seen is the kind that comes in a bottle. \n\n14 years later, and the boss was doing what he had always done. Taking what wasn’t his. \n\n*“Best get back inside preacher before I reunite you with your maker sooner than you’d imagined.”*\n\nHe took his eyes off the slamming church doors to do a quick check of his men. He’d never met the six on the roof before, he hated hired help but today would have to be an exception. The same couldn’t be said for the four occupying a window each of the Inn across the street. These boys he had bled with, rode with, and stole with before.\n\nThe two in the street with him were more like family than friends. He’d taken “One,” in after catching the gorilla of a man trying to steal his horse right from underneath him, and “Two,” had come a year later, as hard as any man, but with wickedness only a woman could provide. \n\n*“Ten minuets, that’s it, then we are out of here.

Somewhere in the back of his head the boss registered the blood curling scream of the man as Two crouched over the man, but right now he needed that vault door open. \n\n9 minutes. \n\n\t“Get that damn vault open One, we don’t have ti-“\n\nSomething’s off, what the hell is that noise? \n\nThe boss spun around, shooting the man in the head to shut him up and covering Two’s mouth to stifle her ignorant protest. \n\n*Nothing. There’s nothing.* \n\nIt took him a minute to wrap his mind around what was bothering him. Where were the gun shots from his hired hands, where were the screams of the people, the unavoidable crash of broken windows as shutters slammed?\n\nSilence.\n\n*“What the hell? Stay here One, keep working on that door.”* \n\nHis eyes squinted all too automatically as he stepped over what was left of the door he had splintered a few moments prior. \n\n*God it’s hot*\n\nLooking up at one of his men in the windows The boss followed his gaze up the street. He had learned years ago not to bother and focus on something that far away since the heat off the ground made it all but impossible. Still, he couldn’t help himself but to try.\n\nHe yelled up to the man in the window,\n\n*“Pinkerton?”*  \n\nThe man shrugged but set his rifle on the ledge anyway. \n\nCouldn’t be, how could they know already?\n\nThe boss sighed; he didn’t have time for this. A few more moments and the man would be within range of his long rifles. \n\n\t“Put him down, wrong place, wrong time.”\n\nThe boss smiled as he heard the comforting sound of gunpowder,\n\nSorry friend, it wasn’t personal\n\nThen he was on the ground, an explosion driving him to his stomach. Cursing One for ignoring his orders concerning dynamite The boss staggered to his feet and spun around.\n\n\t“WHAT THE HELL!?”\n\nAnother explosion flung bits of wood and sand screaming into his face and eyes. This wasn’t One, this came from the wrong side of the street. The boss’s eyes went wide as he saw a man on a horse throw another bottle into the Inn. His shot flung wide left as the explosion sent a wave of heat and sound scorching the right side of his face. He spun around wildly, searching for the man on horseback as the Inn collapsed inward. \n\nThe sound of a long-rifle brought him back, watching in horror as his men on the rooftops began falling on after another, dead eyed into the street. \n\nDucking behind a coach, The boss cursed, eyes darting back and forth searching for who was tearing his team apart one by one. \n\nTHERE!\n\nA glimpse of a man between buildings, walking as calm as Sunday as he shot upward killing man after man. \n\nTHERE!\n\nThis time a woman on horseback flying through the street building the Inn with his men inside of it. He could hear their screams for help. \n\n\t“Boss, what the hell-“\n\nTwo had made it out of the bank and was running to him. \n\n“Time to get up, One’s got the money and we gotta go.” \n\nHe grabbed her arm, leaning on her shoulder as he stood. He didn’t know who was doing this, but he was going to find out, and make them pay.\n\n\t“Bring those horses from around back, I’ll help One-“\n\nSomething warm hit the boss’s face.\n\n*What?*\n\nConfused the boss saw the look on Two’s face; disbelief, anger, but mostly fear. His eyes followed hers downward, towards the darkening hole in her chest. \n\n\t“NO!”\n\nHe grabbed under her arms, if he could just keep her standing. Then the boss saw him. The man he hadn’t been able to focus on earlier. The man wearing all black. His eyes fought desperately to make out the figure walking slowly towards him. Even as the wind drove sand into his eyes, even as his face cracked drinking in every drop of sweat his body forced out. How could this have happened, he had thought this through, planned it, he had all the men he needed. He wasn’t even supposed to be here, he should have been in Charleston, should have never stolen for the first time, never needed gold, never met Two. His eyes widened as the man in black stepped into focus, and for the first time in years the boss laughed. Laughed as in his periphery he watched One try to run, the weight of the silver pieces slowing him down until he caught a bullet between the shoulder blades, coins raining on his already lifeless body. Laughed as the woman on horseback shot the last man from the Inn as he tried to crawl out of the fire. His ribs ached, his throat burned, and he dropped Two’s staring body to the ground as he clutched his stomach, doubled over now as his cackle turned to a scream of rage from some deep down fire he had felt before. \n\n*That’s it, just a few more steps you son of a #BADWORDS#*\n\nThe man in black walked closer still, the boss spat\n\n*Not even raising your gun, that’s fine I’ve killed men like you befo-*\n\nThe boss dropped his gun\n\n*It can’t be*\n\nThe man in black took another step forward as The boss’s last thought raced across his face. He felt life rush out of him as the bullet tore through his right eye exploding out of the back of his head, his corpse falling to its knees, pausing for a second and then slacking backwards leaving a growing pool of blood beneath it. \n\n*A kid?*\n\nThe man in black stood over The boss, wiping his gun clean.\n\n“Dang Wyatt, you sure do know how to make a mess, hellooo Wyatt, Wyatt?”\n\n\t“WYATT!”\n\nWyatt Porter looked up from the stick in his hand, the smallest of smirks skating his young face he laughed as he ran across his backyard, late for dinner as always. \n\n\t“Coming!”    \n   \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415124914","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clsu596","link_id":"t3_2l9eaf","name":"t1_clsu596","parent_id":"t3_2l9eaf","retrieved_on":1426194644,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}
{"archived":false,"author":"ObliviousStudent","body":"Rob immediately reached out to shut off the alarm, even though he had to be up early, he liked to let her rest as long as he could.  As he struggled to haul his eyelids open, she moaned lightly and shooched backwards towards him so that her butt was pressed up against his back, providing warmth that was always absent in the mornings.  No matter how tightly he wrapped himself up in blankets, she always managed to sneak them away from him.  \n\nHe looked over at the two dogs, stretching and yawning in their kennels waiting to be let out to deposit an unholy amount of slobber and hair on someones unsuspecting face.  He opened the kennels, ushering the dogs downstairs with him.  As he started the coffee pot, he heard the telltale sounds of paws on the hardwood stairs followed immediately by Kayla's giggling and halfhearted yells for them to get down.  As he untangled the leashes, he whistled twice, and stepped out with the dogs into the brisk winter air.\n\nAfter a leisurely three block walk, Rob's nose and ears were quite chilled and the dogs had been transformed from cuddly balls of fur and slobber into creatures akin to the Tasmanian Devil.  He turned them loose and smiled as they bolted into the house, once again followed by giggling, this time from the kitchen.\n\nHe trudged up the stairs, quickly showering, running a razor over his face, and brushing his teeth, digging out clothes from their dresser.  He walked downstairs, dragging his fingers through his still damp hair, and poked his head into the kitchen.  Kayla's hair was poofed out in 6 different directions, and her gorgeous brown eyes were still heavy in spite of their happy glow as she cradled a cup of coffee in one hand and attempted to sneakily feed freshly cooked bacon to the dogs with the other.  He rushed into the kitchen, with a grin on his face and picked her up, spinning in circles, eliciting a squeal from his wife as she splashed coffee all over the floor.  He grabbed some paper towel, cleaning up the mess and watched her attempt to keep her infectious smile off her face, replaced with false disapproval.  Still grinning, he quickly grabbed a coffee to go and the lunch Kayla had made for him - BLT's, his favorite and made for his jacket and the door.  \n\nThe stamping of bare feet running across the floor caused him to turn suddenly, right in time to catch a suddenly airborne Kayla leaping at him, smiling wide, and eyes shining like the sun.  He stood there for a few minutes, basking in her - the way the light shone through her crazy bedhead, illuminating her face. The way she nuzzled against his neck, and wrapped both her arms and legs around him.  He mentally began the countdown until his 10 hour day was over, and set her down, reaching for the door.  Suddenly, he turned around as though he had forgotten something, looking wildly about.  Confusion quickly transformed into joy on Kayla's face as Rob seemed to remember what he had forgotten and leaned in to kiss her goodbye, tangling his fingers in her hair before stepping out into the cold.

{"archived":false,"author":"agrarian_miner","body":"Throughout the history of Heaven, there has always been much debate amongst the various angels on how to deal with the problem of human prayer.    Ostensibly, one of the mandates of God, to the angels of heaven, was to answer prayers, but  the Angels  were short staffed, directionless, and frankly way to underpowered to effectively accomplish this.    \n\nIn order to hear a human prayer, an angel would have to actively listen to the human doing the praying, determine if the prayer was worthy of being answered, submit it to a committee for approval, and then be carried out to the best of the Angels ability.  A talented angel, may be able to listen to three humans at once, and answer about 10 prayers per week.   In the early days, this was a daunting task, but with humanities burgeoning population, an angels increased workloads from other celestial duties, it quickly got to the point where Angel kind didn’t even know where to start.  \n\nThere was debate on whether to appeal to God for extra staff or additional administrative privilege, but frankly pe#BADWORDS#oning God was not a smart career move for an Angel, so the issue remained unraised. \n\nThat is not to say that nothing was done to try to solve this problem.  Jerahmeel, an Angel of Heaven, went as far to successfully create the first automated prayer answering system.     Unfortunately Jerahmeels work, as well as all subsequent attempts at such a system did not end well. The council of Angels tried using different automated prayer answering devices for a short period of time, but no matter how much they tweaked the algorithms, these devices created pandemonium amongst the humans of the Earth.   Eventually the idea was shelved.\n\nAnd so, for the last couple of thousands of years, the issue of human prayer fell on the wayside.   Human prayer became the sort of thing that was almost completely ignored, with, at the end maybe only one or two prayers being answered every century.\n\n-x\n\n\nGabriel, Raphael, and the other executives of the Angel council were very weary when Metatron announced a general meetings between the Angels of Heaven, and the Lord of Heaven, and Creator of the Universe, YHWH.\n\n“What do you think this is about?” Raphael asked Gabriel.   Raphael  tried to seem collected, and slightly exasperated, but he was obviously nervous for the upcoming meeting.\n\n“I do not know for certain,” replied Gabriel, “but I imagine, it has to do with the recent glitch in the weather system down in the South Pacific.”\n\n“Do you think God is calling us to reprimand Barachiel then?” Raphael asked.\n\n“I hope not.  Barachiel had done a fantastic job, and it really wasn’t his fault that this problem occurred. But you know, who knows  who our Lord will choose to admonish.”  Gabriel, at this point in his career had given up all hope of trying to predict God’s decisions.\n\n“I am glad I am not Barachiel,” said Raphael. \n\n“Me too.”\n\n-x\n\n\n“ANGELS OF HEAVEN!  TAKE WITNESS, IT IS I RULER OF HEAVEN, LORD OF THE UNIVERSE, AND CREATOR OF EVERYTHING, YHWH”\n\nThe Angels arranged themselves in a large lecture hall.  God was manifesting himself on stage.  Important Angels such as Raphael and Gabriel were sitting up front, with notebooks in their hands. \n\n“ANGELS OF HEAVEN! LOYAL SERVANTS WHO SERVE CREATION IN MY NAME”\n\nGods manifestation, shifted and glowed.   It was really very impressive and pretty (in the burn the eyes out of a mortal viewer kind of way), but to the Angels of Heaven, it was a source of great anxiety.\n\n“IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT YOU HAVE BEEN IGNORING MY MANDATE TO ANSWER THE PRAYERS OF HUMANS”\n\nOh god, This? Thought Gabriel as he slowly rubbed his temple.  Raphael was visibly sweating.  The other Angels was also restless and nervous, except for Barachiel who exhaled a sigh of relief.\n\n“I HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE HUMANS WHO DOUBT MY VERY EXISTENCE, WHO DENY MY MIRACLES, WHO RELY ON VULGAR THINGS, TECHNIQUES AND ARTS, FOR THEIR HEALTH AND WELLNESS INSTEAD OF MY MERCY”\n\n“THIS DEGRADATION, THIS LACK OF SUBSERVIENCE, THIS IRRELIGIOUS AT#BADWORDS#UDE HAS IT ROOT NOT IN THE WEAKNESS OF MAN, BUT THE APATHY OF THE PRESENT COMPANY WHO FAIL TO CARRY OUT MY DESIGNS IN THE GLORY OF MY NAME, SO THAT MY CHILDREN ON EARTH MAY SING MY PRAISES.”\n\n“THEREFOR MY ANGELS, I RENEW MY MANDATE.  WHEN HUMANS MAKE PRAYERS TO HEAVEN, ANSWER THEM!” \n\n“My Lord,”  Gabriel spoke up, “We eagerly wish to follow your words, but there are several logistical difficulties in effectively granting human prayer.”\n\n“SILENCE,” spoke God, “DO YOU CHALLENGE MY LEADERSHIP, DO YOU QUESTION MY JUDGEMENT, DO YOU HOLD YOURSELF ABOVE ME?  DOES YOUR VOICE THUNDER LIKE MINE, HAVE YOU DESIGNED THE EARTH AND THE COSMOS?  I HAVE MADE MY PROCLAMATION! FOR NOWST UNTO ETERNITY THOUST SHALL ANSWER THE PRAYERS OF ALL WHO WORSHIP ME!”\n\n“Just to clarify,” asked Gabriel, “you want us to answer every single prayer to you by every single human?”\n\n“THAT IS THE WILL OF YHWH”\n\n“And so it will be.”  Gabriel inwardly sighed.  The meeting was adjourned. \n\n-x\n\n“What are we going to do?”  asked Raphael, “We struggled listening to all the prayers when there were but a couple million humans, now there are over 6 billion.  Also, as God spends more time creating parallel worlds, and elaborate paradoxes, we have a higher workload now than we have ever had before .”\n\n“What can we do ,” said Gabriel,  “We have to use Jerahmeel’s toy.”\n\n“But the algorithm never does what it should, and if we set it to answer everybody’s prayer, Earth will fall into complete and utter chaos.”\n\n“Do you wish to resign?” Asked Gabriel as he continuously rubbed his temples. \n\n“No,”  Raphael said.  “I don’t want to end up in hell.”\n\n“Nor do I, Raphael.   Nor do I.”\n\n-x\n\nAnd so, as every prayer to God started to be answered, society started to crumble, as twisted humans had their twisted dreams fulfilled by the mandate of heaven.  \n\nThe world was doomed for but one man,  Ezekiel Johnson, who had the fortune of having the sniffles from birth.  \n\nBeing blessed with peoples vocal prayers to the point where no wicked prayer could affect him, Ezekiel was the one man who could fight for a peaceful society as the ins#BADWORDS#utions of man crumbled.\n\nThis is his story- (to be completed at a later date)\n--\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415289574","downs":0,"edited":"1415378549","gilded":0,"id":"clurfhw","link_id":"t3_2lgt1w","name":"t1_clurfhw","parent_id":"t3_2lgt1w","retrieved_on":1426161432,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

In a minute, I would catch up with him *and oh, the joy of passing the blade through his chest would be nothing short of sweet*. Vengeance is, after all, sweet.\n\nEven more motivated, I sped up in my pursuit and was now within metres of the killer of my family. I could not have been any more happier when both of us were chosen as the Gladiators from our district. Having escaped punishment from the law after raping and killing my mother and then getting away scot-free again after murdering my father who had come after him, he was worse than my enemy. He was a family destroyer. He was a monster. He was the devil in my eyes. As it always is, the justice system was anything but just. However, here I was given a great opportunity to avenge everything. I assured myself that I was not going to waste it. \n\nHearing him panting now, I swiftly unsheathed my sword from the scabbard while running. Within half a minute, the scenario was as I had always fantasied it to be. He lay on the ground, begging and pleading for mercy as I walked around him. Onlookers had started gathering and I spoke for the first time, and due to the deafening silence of the crowd, everyone could here me. \n\nIn an unusually low and vengeful voice, I said, \"You #BADWORDS# my mother. You killed her. You killed my father. There will be no greater pleasure for me than the next moment. As I push the blade inside you, your filthy blood will spill, and a great responsibility will be lifted from my shoulders. I will not spare you any last words. Be killed, you monster!\"\n\nWith that, I raised my sword only for an old woman to rush between us. \n\n\"Get out of my way!\" I snarled at her. \n\n\"No! Spare him, he's my only child. Please- please-\" and with her voice breaking, she knelt beside him as the two hugged while tears flowed freely. \n\nIt was a moving moment for everyone. Everyone, except me. I was this close to vengeance. *Now I even have a parent here. If I can't get both of his parents, I guess I'll just settle for one. I don't care if I get killed off for this because sweet, sweet vengeance will be mine.* \n\nThe crowd gasped as I raised my sword again and pushed it through her and into him. \n\nGasps, and then silence.\n\nI had expected pleasure to wash inside me immediately. As my sword clattered to the floor, I went on my knees in a daze. *This was my moment, then where was the happiness, the relief?* As I looked at the two blood-covered bodies, still hugging, the realisation of what I had done began sweeping over me. First slowly, and then all at once. A mother and her child, a criminal child he may be, had been killed by me. BY ME! Their blood was on my hands. I was responsible for their deaths. No matter how many phrasings I used for the observation, the conclusion was the same: *I was a killer*. \n\nJust before the arena controllers sent a lightening bolt to kill me, with my last breaths, I looked up to the heavens: *Mother, father, forgive me.*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415410894","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clwa8lq","link_id":"t3_2lmply","name":"t1_clwa8lq","parent_id":"t3_2lmply","retrieved_on":1426134003,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

Well, not haha-funny, but you know the funny that your grandmother loved her begonias but ended up getting a scratch while pruning them that eventually went septic, and she died. Well, you get the picture.\n\n“Anyway, why I’ve got the webcam out is that I think I need to say a few things, and hopefully before well, um, let’s just leave it at before. It’s weird how I can’t say it, isn’t it? It’s not like saying the words are going to change anything. Yet I can’t.  I-, I-, I can’t.\n\n“This is hard, isn’t it? All those people on YouTube make it look easy.\n\n“Anyway, I don’t have a lot of time thought because, well, you know, so thing one: what in the world are we doing?\n\n“You don’t know me, yet how come I get to, have to. Well, that. I think most of the people that know me don’t want me to-, have me-. But as a society, we condone this. We wouldn’t want our brothers, our sisters, our daughters, sons, nieces, nephews, friends, second cousin twice removed to be here, sitting where I am, wearing this mark. But, we do want someone to. We require someone. We make someone.\n\n“And I guess, I guess I’m someone. \n\n“There is absolutely no logical purpose in this. I have done nothing that warrants that I should be, well, that. Or that I should be allowed to do the other thing. It doesn’t help anyone that we do this, besides letting a few psychopaths get their jollies. And it for sure doesn’t help any of us someones. \n\n“The others, I looked them up, got their names, you know. I heard that you shouldn’t read their names, but I’m guess I’m a rebel, sitting here talking to the screen and scouring the Internet for shreds of society. \n\n“The others, they are a teacher, a lawyer, a nurse, a janitor, a stay-at-home mom, a retired civil engineer, a musician, an unemployed writer, and a ex-military guy who currently works in security. I give you ten bucks if you can guess who’s walking out of here, but the point is that when we all woke up this morning, we weren’t Contestants. We woke up as people. I was going to go to teach a class this morning, so everyone in the morning section of Math 430, you just missed a quiz, so congrats. Haha, I guess some people do benefit out of this.\n\n“I was going to call my little brother. \n\n“Hi Sam, if you’re watching this. My old calculus binder is my bin down in the storage shed, if you need it. It has all my old tests in there. You better study, Sammy!\n\n“Anyway, my big whole spiel in all this was to say that I’m not going to be a Contestant. I woke up this morning a person, and I think I still am a person. I still have all my same morals and ideals. I’m not going to fight. I’m not going to kill. Instead, I’m going to d-, I going to stand here and die because I think this whole thing is utterly wrong. \n\n“If no one else is going to be the martyr, I guess I have to. \n\n“So anyone watching this, please, don’t let me die in vain. That sounded awfully dramatic, but I’m going to, to die here, so I guess maybe I’m allowed some drama. Everyone should-\n\n“What was that? Was that was the window. No. Oh my god. No! NO!”\n\n“Aghhh--.”\n\n“No. Wait! No! Oh my god. I didn’t--. I’m sorry. I didn’t--. I’m so sorry. Oh, please no. I didn’t mean to, please believe me. I’m sorry. Please, Mr. Polanski, Jim. It’s Jim, right?

{"archived":false,"author":"PlatypusPlague","body":"The pain in my side woke me with a jolt. I gasped for breath as I tried to sit up. The pain was too much though, and I collapsed back into the bed. I coughed, painfully, and looked around, trying to focus through a splitting headache.\n\nThe room was mostly dark. The walls looked metallic, but they had a soft glow emanating from them. I blinked and rubbed my eyes, moving my head to look around while being careful to move my torso as little as possible.\n\n\"Eroshnen haz mirz elt.\"\n\nThe unexpected noise caused me to jump, and I found myself gasping for air again as the pain ripped through my chest. I moaned and tried to look for the source of the sound.\n\n\"Perota mez?\"\n\nI craned my neck and could see a reptilian figure standing near my head. His slit eyes were unsettling. He was a smaller creature, and wore plain clothing. If he had been human, I might have even pegged him for a doctor.\n\n\"Perota mez?\" he asked again as he reached a clawed hand near my head.\n\nI panicked and tried to swat it away. The motion was more of a cringing, body crunching groan than anything else. I was able to make contact with his hand, but not with any substantial force. It was cool to the touch, and smooth. The scales were so tightly laid together that I couldn't feel their edges. It was like his skin was maid of flexible steel.\n\nThe lizard creature paused for a second. \"Mez yuras, torat gera,\" he said softly. I think he was meaning to be calming, but hearing him nearly whisper just made me think of snakes and hissing. There really wasn't much I could do though, so I just closed my eyes and hoped it was all just a bad dream. The whole thing seemed ridiculous. The coliseum, the fight, the announcers, the crowd. \n\nI felt his hand brush against my skull, his claws scratching me slightly. I heard a small click, followed by him speaking again.\n\n\"Is that better?\" The voice came from near my ear this time. I blinked. I could hear him speaking his native language in the background, and it finally struck me I must be wearing some sort of translator.\n\n\"I...yes.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"And how do you feel?\"\n\n\"Sore.\"\n\nHe nodded again. \"I must admit I don't know much about your species physiology. We have been studying your kind for some time, however, it seems the organizers of today's event didn't think you would survive. Therefore, they didn't send me any of the data on your kind.\"\n\nHe looked at me, as if expecting a response. The more I looked at him, the more he looked almost human. If you could just replace the eyes and add some hair, and maybe make his mouth a little smaller, you could almost imagine he was someone with a bad skin condition. Who had their nose cut off. And no lips. No, definitely not human.\n\nHe shrugged. \"There are a few things I can say for sure. Your left ribs are broken. I don't believe any of your organs were severely damaged. At least, none of them were punctured. I am still watching to see how your body reacts to bruising. Some species do not react well.\" He looked me up and down for a moment. \"May I?\" He asked as he reached towards me.\n\nI tried to pull back, but couldn't move far, and I didn't really know what to say. My mind was mostly trying to process whether or not someone with a cut off nose would look like his.\n\nHe sighed, and slowly pressed on my shoulders. I hissed in a short breath. He continued to poke and prod, though he never pressed on my broken ribs. He didn't really have to.\n\nWhen he was done, he put his hands behind his head. \"Until I get the data on your species, I don't know how much I can do. Grag will be angry if I can't get you fixed up and training soon though. He wants you fighting again.\"\n\nI finally looked away from his face and stared at the ceiling. \"I won't be up for doing much for at least six weeks. Six months before I'm fully back on my feet.\" I glanced back over at the reptile, and saw him shaking his head slowly.\n\n\"That won't do kid. Your next fight is in four weeks. But, if we are lucky, and I only say we because I don't like getting yelled at. You, likely, aren't lucky no matter how you look at it. But, if I am lucky, once we get your data we can run some DNA synth patched viruses through your system and have you walking in a day.\"\n\nI just stared at the ceiling.\n\n\"One more thing. I doubt you'll be using it much at the moment, but the Rietza on your wrist will help you to pass the time. If you want, I can show you how to use it.\"\n\nI looked at him quizzically. \"Rietza?\"\n\nHe nodded, reaching for my hand. He grabbed it while keeping an eye on me. I didn't resist, but I eyed him carefully. He pulled my arm up slowly, careful to only bend it at the elbow. He pointed to a keyboard type device that I hadn't noticed before.\n\n\"Rietza. Its what we call it. It doesn't have a direct translation into your language. The closest would perhaps be computer. The communication protocols are disabled, but you can learn about the coliseum, watch some fights, even start doing some research if you felt up for it.\"\n\nHe pressed a button and a hologram appeared floating above it, oriented with my line of sight. It was smaller than the one I remembered from the coliseum, but the quality was the same. Lifelike, except for a small bit of translucency. It was a miniature human woman, with brown hair and blue eyes.\n\nHer voice echoed near my ear. \"Greetings, Jake. Please wait a moment while I establish the neurolink.\" Before I could even start to formulate any questions she continued. \"Neurolink established. You can begin issuing voice commands, or begin deep neural scans for direct thought instructions.\"\n\nThe reptile nodded. \"Rest. You're going to need it.\" He put his hands behind his head again and walked out of the room.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415424958","downs":0,"edited":"1415425234","gilded":0,"id":"clwfjzt","link_id":"t3_2l7t7l","name":"t1_clwfjzt","parent_id":"t1_clsaswf","retrieved_on":1426131522,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

Her dog had taken to pawing at her in the last few weeks, but due to her power, nothing happened. Annoyed, the dog pushed Amanda off of the bed.\n\nNow this action triggered a chain of events. Due to the shape of Amanda's floor, she began to roll out of it, out of the door and into the living room. The dog, in a panic, tried to bite her hair and pull her back, but he only managed to pushed her further outside.\n\nOnce she had gotten past her family's garden, and past the front lawn, her motion stopped. On a road.\n\n Of course a car came barreling along the road just minutes later, smashing into Amanda, not harming her, but still carrying the girl, all the way out into the city, where even the bright lights and the deafening noise of the people and cars didn't wake her up.\n\nNow would be a good time to mention the people in this car, a tall, black truck. They were bad people.  And tonight they had a plot. They began to drive to a normal-looking office building, which just hours earlier was the sight of a brutal takeover no one was aware of yet.\n\nThe people parked their car and exited the vehicle. One of them carried a rope, which snagged at Amanda's hair and pulled her along into the building. This was a very strong, burly man, and he noticed no difference in the weight he was carrying.\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking in which no one looked at the ground, or their feet, they came into a regular-sized room, the heart of their operations. In the very center was a small item, about the size of a pillow. The burly man walked right up to it, carting along the sleeping Amanda with his rope.\n\n\"We's about ready to sets dis thing off?\" asked the burly man.\n\n\"Very soon,\" replied the other man, frail, wearing goggles and a lab coat.\n\nAs the burly man walked away from the bomb, the rope's path intersecting with the bomb that caused Amanda to be laying right next to it.\n\nIn this chain of events, Amanda had become separated from her pillow. And one of her more con#BADWORDS#uous sleeping habits was to curl up very tightly with it.\n\nSo she curled up with the bomb, moments away from exploding.\n\nEveryone else had long gone away from the bomb, and there was no one to intervene.\n\nAn explosion that should have wiped out half of the state instead was reduced to a small, sad *poof* as Amanda snored, drooling a little bit.\n\nAnd ever since that perceived failure, those men have never again enacted a plot.\n\nAmanda returned home.\n\nAnd- Oh yeah!

{"archived":false,"author":"not_quite_eidetic","body":"Wearily, I headed back towards my first creation, the orb I had destined for greatness. It was to be my paradise, full of undisturbed and pristine beauty.  I hadn’t been able to even look over it in a few eons, given the time consuming task of overseeing in the other galaxies.  The beings there had finally sorted it out and I now had time to myself, for what felt like the first time in my existence.  \n\nI attempted to remember what I had put on the earth at the beginning of time, was there only one mass of land on the equator line? Had I allowed for the right climate in the entirety of the planet or had I left most of it to become barren? Did I place too near to its heat source, the star? As I passed through the shimmering asteroid clouds of other galaxies, I realized that so much time had passed, I would not be encountering the same place I left. I could only hope for a place that closely engendered what I had made.  \n\nBecause I moved with a deliberately slow pace instead of willing myself directly to earth, I had time to prepare myself for the changes I might find. I could never have slowed enough to prepare myself for the new earth, the earth of humans.  \n\nI came to the correct galaxy and I saw that the planets looked more or less equivalent to my memory. I took it as a good sign, for how could earth change if these others did not? The frigid tiny planet at the edge of the rotation seemed just as lonely. The ringed planet had just as many rings around it’s cir#BADWORDS#ference as I had intended. Nothing seemed much out of place until I passed the red orange dusty globe that was nearest to earth and felt something amiss.  The earth was within my view and I saw shining pieces of what I took to be machinery circulating in its orbit.  \n\nI was stunned, yet I knew what had happened. There was intelligent life on my paradise, and it had come somehow from what I had created those billions of years ago.  Being too busy and too quick at the creation had left me with a mess of my own doing.  From my experience with these types, I knew these were still probably a young population, and had no idea what they were doing.  I was coming to a place of war and divided minds, to a place of faith and atheism.  The joke was on me, like a scientist coming back to his experiment and realizing he had contaminated it with poor technique.\n\nHumans, they spoke of themselves, creatures with good minds but too much pride and emotion.  Many thought I was their savior and they worshipped me fervently. I went by many names on this earth and had many different roles. To some I was angry and was the punisher of evil beings. Others believed me benevolent and loving of all the humans of the world.  Some doubted the existence of a creator at all, and chose science as their god.  These last category came the closest. Science was their creator, as I had created earth for myself and had never meant for them to exist at all.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415566689","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"clxqn11","link_id":"t3_2lshi2","name":"t1_clxqn11","parent_id":"t3_2lshi2","retrieved_on":1426108260,"score":635,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":635}

And was angry, Hollow Knife Johnson immediately proclaimed, like all them --- well, I won't repeat the word he used for women, partly because of respect for them-all, and partly because I do not want to be hen-pecked to death like Johnson was.\n\nI didn't even know anyone in town kept chickens.\n\nGaia had awakened and wasn't angry, the prophet said.\n\nIn fact, Gaia --- that's to say, primeval and benevolent All-American Mother Earth, not some Alaskan undermountain Godzilla --- was really happy with what mankind had done. She was really warming to us. She was outright sculpted now, her muscles standing out without all that flab of coal and those sagging pockets of oil. She'd meant to get make-up done too, so she really liked those Exxon Valdez beauty spots and that big BP blush of eyeshadow on her baby blues. And the metallic-red accents on her landscape, and those puffs of natural gas perfume --- those were risque on a lady of her age, but she wasn't complaining! No, but she wanted to be still prettier, and she apparently needed us little mortals to help with, especially all the nature-loving tree-hugging people.\n\nShe even had a list of places where to dig, drill and cut. Some of those places were not familiar to me, but Bookman Steggings helped me saying them were foreign, some of them.\n\nWe were all mighty puzzled by all this, and didn't quite know what to make of it, foreign travel being costly and all.

War was always a bloody business, but never more so than when a battle took place at close quarters and a soldier had to fall back on hand-to-hand tactics.\n\nHaving been assigned a largely ceremonial role of guarding a war memorial in the capital, Hailey had not expected to encounter any kind of combat situation, but, confronted with a threat to the memory of his nation's war-dead he had acted without hesitation. Still, some small part of him realised that deploying lethal force against a crowd of protesting hippies might not be a terribly good idea.\n\nDiscarding his rifle he'd grabbed the nearest blunt object (to wit; a rather scrawny young man approximately one fifth of the colossal Sergeant's body-mass) and laid into the musty smelling, tie-dyed, mob.\n\nSeveral miles away in his office, Sergeant Hailey's commanding officer sat watching the live news-feed of the khaki clad man-mountain whirling the long haired youth around his head like a medieval mourning-star.

{"archived":false,"author":"Nanophreak","body":"Once upon a time, and thrice upon a space, there was a universe, made and managed by great and powerful gods. It is somewhat like our universe, but it is also nothing like it.\n\nFor in this universe, one of the gods of creation, a god of Time, and Fate, and Life, was also the god of Regret. And this changed all.\n\nBeing the god of both Regret and Life, he understood the pain of men, and other creatures, who looked back on past mistakes in anguish, full of the useless knowing of what they could have done better. \n\nAnd being the god of Time, and Fate, he had the power to help them.\n\nIn this universe, there was magic. It had rules, and costs, and limits. It was a reasonable thing, but utterly inexplicable to those of other universes. Many gods had shaped this magic, and many gods had set the laws that bound it.\n\nThe sympathetic god made his own contribution to the magic that mortals could wield, and other, harsher gods imposed its limits.\n\nIt was a tedious spell, and costly, by the end. Once bound to a thrice-bound book and twice-born infant, it would begin to fill that book with writing. This writing would detail the life of the child, from birth to present, filling in with each passing moment. \n\nReading the book gave that mortal a single chance to undo a single past event, and live over again the moment of their regret, with all the knowledge of the life they had after. It was a power highly sought, but the books were rarely wrought.\n\nFor while the limits were reasonable, and the rules plain, the cost was simple, but terrible.\n\nAfter the moment has passed and the regret is undone, the book is engulfed in holy fire. It burns, and so with it burns the life of the one it is bound to. All their memory is lost, and they who they once were is the next thing to dead.\n\nIt is a terrible thing, to be a mortal in such a world, and find your father one day unable to remember anything, or your lover, or your child, and know that something terrible has been undone. It is something every mortal recognizes, and for it, they both curse and love the sympathetic god.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415691570","downs":0,"edited":"1415692724","gilded":0,"id":"clz87t1","link_id":"t3_2ly0hc","name":"t1_clz87t1","parent_id":"t3_2ly0hc","retrieved_on":1426082763,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"shtayawhileandlisten","body":"Part 2\n___\n\nHades chuckled. “Of all people, Charon, you most of all should know the rules. Everyone must pay their own fare.”\n\n“I am not paying a fare. I am not buying freedom. I am buying slaves. All of those who wander the bank of the Living. I offer you a Sol for all of their souls. They will be mine to command. Each with their own boats, to serve me and ferry the newly dead. They will be mine to command, to call, to dismiss, and…to release, on my terms.”\n\nHades considered Charon closely. When he spoke, it was the soft cajoling tone of a man trying to talk a friend out of a poor decision. He slowly walked around the Ferryman. \n\n“Charon. You can be rid of your burden entirely! You don’t need a fleet of boatmen. Your answer is here, right here in your hand. A Sol for a soul, and your debt is paid. A new boatman will take your place, and you will move on to your eternal reward. Don’t trouble yourself with that rabble. Be free!”\n\nCharon shook his head. “No. I remember how I came to be in your service. I remember why I do this. And I know your rules. You cannot refuse a fair offer. I offer you the fares collected from tens of billions of souls over thousands of years. I ask for the purchase of much fewer than that. This is a fair offer for you. I repeat to you my offer: A Sol for all those that wander the Bank of the Living.”\n\n“And how many centuries have you worked at this task, Charon? Think of how long it will take you to amass that number again. And with fewer and fewer each year coming with fare? Your foolish deal could negotiate you into to my service forever. You deserve rest, Charon. You’ve been very loyal, and I would love to release you, and you know that what you must offer me for that to happen is exactly what you hold in your hand. Again, my counteroffer: one Sol…for your freedom, and residence for as long as you choose in the great fields of Elysium.”\n\nElysium. The fields of eternal joy and peace. He could—\n\n“No.” The sound of his own voice broke his reverie. He remembered again why he had come, and chose his words carefully to seal the bargain. “Thrice said and done, Hades: one Sol in exchange for all of those on the other side of the river. Mine to command, to summon, to dismiss as I see fit.  Each with their own boat. Thrice said and done!”\n\nHis voice echoed across the marble hall, and he realized that he had not spoken that loudly in centuries. As the echoes faded, there was only silence. Thrice said and done. Hades had to accept his fair offer, but he remained silent, looking at Charon as though he could see through him. He had to accept the offer…unless…Charon’s confidence faltered. Had he miscalculated? He was certain he knew…\n\n“I accept your offer. You shall have them.” Hades’ friendly tone was gone. As he spoke, he held out his hand. The coin floating above Charon’s palm exploded into millions of small gold coins, which arced towards the Lord of Wealth’s outstretched hand. The coins all struck his palm simultaneously as he closed his long, pale fingers around them. He closed his eyes for a moment. When he reopened them, he opened his hand. There was no sign of any coin. “It is done.”  \n\nCharon fought the urge to exhale in relief.  He wanted his new servants assembled on the Death side of the river, and he knew they would be. Hades was still watching him. Charon bowed deeply. “I thank you, O Lord of Death and Wealth.” As he did, he caught a glint in the corner of his eye. He looked and saw that his iron band was now a gleaming silver.\n\nHades waved him towards the door. “You may go. I will see you, perhaps, in another few millennia.” He turned back towards his throne.  “If the price has not gone up.” \n\nCharon accepted his dismissal and turned back towards the door. In two steps he was through it. As he stepped through, he felt his foot hit rough stone, and he looked down to see the path to the dock of the Acheron. He looked behind him. The palace and the necropolis were gone. He stood at the end of the dock and saw millions of boats impossibly moored to it. All the souls stood in their own boats of Rowan, awaiting his command. Each of them wore a bronze band around their arms.\n\n“Step off your boats,” he commanded. “And assemble here on the shore.”\n\nMillions of footsteps echoed upon the dock, and then upon the grey dirt of the riverbank. Millions of souls that he had refused passage, watching him silently. \n\nHe walked through the crowd, looking for his purpose in all of this. He found her moments later, her fair golden curls just as he remembered them. Her deep blue eyes reminded him of the sky he had not seen in millennia. She watched him silently. \n\n“Celes…” he whispered her name for the first time since they’d stood together at the dock. She watched him silently. He brushed a strand of her hair from her face, gently feeling her skin. He felt human for the first time in countless years. But she was a slave, and could not respond. He would not command her to, either. He knew that this deal would not bring her back to him. But it would end her suffering. He would see to that.\n\n“I have bought you all from Hades, Lord of the Underworld,” his voice carried to all of them. He filled it with power as he prepared his first decree. “As your Master, I have only one command for you: Be free.” He looked his love in her eyes. “Be free. I release you all, here, across the river. Wander no more. Lament no more. Move on to that which awaits the dead.”\n\nHe felt a breeze whip through the crowd. He heard countless small clicks as the bronze bands snapped open and fell from the arms of his momentary workforce. They fell towards the ground and evaporated into puffs of smoke before they could complete their fall. A sigh ran through the crowd as they took their first clear, free breaths. \n\nHe looked at Celes as her slave band fell from her arm. She blinked and looked at him, truly seeing him for the first time. Her eyes widened.\n\n“It’s…it’s you…” her words were leaden with years of disuse and confusion.  “Is it…? I can’t remember. You are…but…you aren’t…” She shook her head. “I can’t…”\n\n“It’s all right,” he reassured her, reaching his hand toward her. She flinched at his reach, but let him put his hand on her shoulder. “It’s me. I’m here.” \n\nAt his touch, her eyes unfocused, the memories starting to return to her all together. She wrapped her arms around him and put her head on his shoulder. He realized he had not felt the touch of another human in thousands of years. “After all these years. You kept your promise. I’m free! And we’re together again!” \n\nHe bowed his head. She did not notice the spirits around them, moving towards the path ahead. But he did.\n“Only for a moment, love. Only for right now, and then, you must go on to your freedom. I’ll join you soon, though. As soon as I can. I promise.” \n\nShe looked up at him, her bright eyes full of tears. “I know. I can feel the call. I can’t stay, can I?” She read the answer on him. “No, I didn’t think so. Are we so cursed, that every time we are reunited we must part again in despair, one forced to wait behind while the other forced to move forward?” She pressed something into his palm. He looked down and saw a golden ring. He’d given it to her an eternity ago. It gleamed brighter than it had any right to in this wan light. “So you can find me again. Nothing can stand between us forever. I love you.”\n\nShe took his head in her hands and kissed him then. In that kiss he remembered life. The sounds, the smells, the light and the sky. He remembered oceans and stars and rivers that did not corrupt your soul. He remembered his life, and he remembered his life with her. \n\nAnd then it ended. He stood once more on the red bank of the Acheron. There was no sky, and no breeze. No sunlight, and only the spiteful river silently slipping by. But he remembered. \n\nShe touched her forehead to his. “I have to go now. I feel it. It calls me and I must answer.” \n\nShe took a step back towards the gate as if pulled. Her hands moved down his shoulders to his wrists. “I will not forget again.” \n\nShe took another step back. Her hands clasped his. “Find me. I will be waiting.” He nodded silently.\n\nShe took another step back. Her fingers brushed his. “I promise.”\n\nShe took another step back. The touch was broken. The crowd of spirits moving past flowed between them. “I love you.”\n\nAnd she was gone. The spirits swarmed around and he could no longer see her. They passed by him, thanking him as they were drawn into their eternity, but he did not hear them.\n\nHe watched until the last one passed through the gate. The hound watched him silently, #BADWORDS#ing one of its heads. Charon did not notice. Nor did he notice the silver band tarnishing until it was indistinguishable from iron. \n\nHe waited there, for what he did not know. When nothing happened, as he knew it wouldn’t, he sighed and turned back towards the dock. There was only one boat there.\n\n    *  *  * \n\nThe Ferryman sat in an eddy in the middle of the river. His boat did not so much as sway. If another boatman were to pass him by (absurd; there is only one Boatman), they would see the hooded figure so still, with his oar between his knees, that they might wonder if he was alive. He was not, but he remembered a time when he was. He reached a hand towards the ring that hung from a leather string around his neck. It was warm in his hand and against his chest. \n\nHe stared at the empty shore. It was silent, and there was no movement. He was alone.\n\nBut not forever, he knew. \n\nHe had made a promise.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1415728107","downs":0,"edited":"1415858680","gilded":0,"id":"clzjnuc","link_id":"t3_2lzgen","name":"t1_clzjnuc","parent_id":"t3_2lzgen","retrieved_on":1426077353,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":false,"author":"WillmG","body":"I feel betrayed.  It's the first thing I can think when they march me off the plane, my wrists painfully shackled to a chain around my waist which extends down to my ankles.  I feel like every fibre in my body is screaming, why have they forsaken me?  They looked at me like I was some kind of animal which didn't belong, foreign s#BADWORDS#.  I went to school among their people, I spoke their language, learned their history.  It was my history, my language... they were *my* people.  Eight years ago I feel in love with a woman who in time became my Wife, when she died it broke me and now that agony is rising in me again.  This time it isn't unbearable grief and blood thirsty vengeance, it's heart wrenching, soul destroying rejection.  As if I had been adopted into the most beautiful family only to discover they never really cared, they held me and fed me but when I made a mistake, when I needed them to tell me it was alright and I could still be a good man; they threw me aside.\n\nI was being returned to a Mother I didn't know, left at her mercy when all I wanted was to be with the ones who'd raised me.  Let them punish me, let them stone me or beat me – I honestly couldn't care.  No punishment can surpass this, a thousand years of torture could never compare to the deep despair which buries itself in my heart as I see the stars and stripes hanging over my head.\n\nThese people don't want me, they take me back because it's their responsibility.  Social services rehoming another wayward kid.  I can see in the eyes of the gathering crowd that they're begging for a death sentence, they don't know me, they don't care about my story.  I make them look bad, plastered on the papers and ridiculed by the press, I lower the universal view of America because my Parents were born here and the thousand eyes staring back at me can never forgive such treason.

{"archived":false,"author":"KerriFL","body":"Looking in the mirror, her eyes traveled over her features. Delicate as they were, only marred by the imperfection of the scars that ran over her eye, above and below. She smiled at the reminiscence that the scars always brought to mind.\n\nOne of the last, she knew it was her legacy that would keep her people going forward, it all rested upon her shoulders. The weight of her responsibilities often times kept her mind occupied. That day had not been one full of responsibility, although it should have been. She had been reckless and wanted to be carefree. Much younger she found reasons to do just as she wanted, if only that one time. A child of mind, yet fully grown, she had set off upon an adventure, one in which she had nearly lost her life. Only to be rescued by the boy she would eventually call her mate. \n\nShe shook her head as she forced herself from the memories of the past, knowing that there was no time to waste. She had important things to do. People of power to meet and speak with. Her people's future rested solely in her hands. She ran her fingers through her coppery hair and green eyes glinted fiercely as she slipped her blade into the sheath already hanging upon her belt. She slid her armor into place, as she held back the laugh at knowing that it really was just for appearances for her. She did not need the protection nor the sword. It tended to allow those around her to relax though, so she dealt with the #BADWORDS#bersome weight, if only to seem more like those around her.  \n\nPutting a single plait into her hair with deft fingers, she tied off the end, while walking out the door of her home. Although a temporary one, it had been the only home she had ever had for any real length of time. She had lived among them for a year now, and the people seemed to have taken her in as one of their own. She knew that was most likely to change after today. For the better or the worse, she wasn't sure. \n\nHer legs carried her over the city to the hall where she would be presenting her case. She wondered if acceptance or ostracism would result in her plea of recourse. She had tried living with the people, letting them see her for what she truly was. Why her people were so misunderstood she had no clue. She did doubt the townspeople would enjoy knowing that she had lived amongst them for so long. It troubled her deeply to know that their preconceived notions might mar the reputation she had tried to build. \n\nAs she neared the hall in all it's opulence she took a deep breath. Holding it, she ran her hands over her face as she felt the slightest bit of dampness cover her palms. Nervousness, filled her being. Her hands shook and she let the fingers of her left hand caress the scar over her eye. \n\nIt pulsed under her touch and she could feel the righteous burn of the scar as it screamed out for her attention. Her other being, tormented inside of her all these months only wanted release, and Tiama soothed herself. Inwardly speaking, \"Just a little longer. Please, wait... just a little longer.\" \n\nWith her newest mantra being repeated in her head she stepped towards the hall, it's regal appearance only intimidating her more. It was then she heard the all too familiar voice inside her own head, \"Do this! Make it work! We need to be free.\" Tiama nodded her head slightly in acknowledgement to the voice. \n\nShe stepped through the carved archway and into the building. Taking another deep breath she looked at the one final set of doors in which she had to pass before her fate would be sealed. Releasing the hot breath from her lungs she took a step forward, then another, only hoping she wouldn't be damning the rest of her kind to a fate worse than the reality they were currently living. \n\nHidden in the depths of caves around the small island nation, her people were slowly withering away and dying for lack of being able to leave their secret dwellings. She felt each of their passings deep within herself. The ache of loss even though she wasn't close. They were connected with her, each held a place inside of her and with each of their deaths she felt a bit more of herself dying. \n\nTiama knew that things had to change. There were only nine of them left. Barely enough to continue their bloodline, but she was hopeful. She only needed to make the humans understand. \n\nShe entered the chambers where her case would be heard, and with eyes of green with flecks of gold she eyed the men and women sitting in the semicircle around the center of the room. These people, the ones that would be her judge and jury. \n\n\"Tiama of,\" the old man's words drifted off as he realized that the only name she had given was just that, there was no formality to her, no #BADWORDS#le at all. His eyes of slate studied her, she could feel his eyes boring into her. \"Tiama what is it you want to present us with?\" He continued on. \n\nShe steeled her spine and stood up tall as she felt a small tremor of fear in her hands. Her voice loud and firm she spoke, \"I am here to beseech you to stop the war with my children and I.\" Simple words, ones without meaning when not given further information, but words that had made murmurs break out among those seated surrounding her. \n\n\"Of what war are you speaking?\" Spoke a woman towards the back. \n\n\"We are a peaceable people, we haven't been at war for ages.\" Claimed a man closer to the man with slate eyes. \n\nWhat are you speaking of young lady?\" The voices began to meld together as one question led to another, then another. \n\nTiama stood her ground, silently, waiting for the commotion to quiet. A few moments passed as the jury that thought they were her peers slowly became silent once more. \n\n\"I am Tiama Draconem, mother to those you kill. We are the peaceable ones. Only ever harming those who intend to harm us. We have lived peacefully for the past 3 decades, but yet one sighting and your kind comes at us with swords and daggers. Ready to draw blood even though we have done nothing wrong.\" She took a deep breath that shook her entire being and as she looked out upon those surrounding her she realized that her hopes would once again fail. The hope to live with these people and no longer having the need to hide would once again be denied her and her kin. \n\n\"You are Draconem?\" Cried out the one with the slate eyes even as he drew his sword. \n\nTiama shook her head, a soft roar leaving her in a rush as her body begin to twist and shake. The armor she had placed upon herself earlier falling to pieces around her, as the people advanced. All with swords drawn. \n\nShe shook her head and tears slipped from her still human-like eyes as she realized that these people would never choose to understand her or her kind. With that her final human thought her human form fell to the ground as it began to change, her bones cracking and changing, her skin hardening turning into iridescent scales in a matter of seconds she was no long Tiama the girl, but Tiama Mother of the Dragons. \n\nOn all fours, her body completely changed, she began to back from the room. The doorway much too small for her newly changed form she forced her way through. The walls and doorway crumbled around her as she tried to escape. \n\nThe humans continued advancing, some striking out with their swords even as she retreated. Tears streamed from her golden dragon eyes as she finally found herself outside. She took to the air, disheartened by these peoples inability to even listen. \n\nShe flew for days and nights, losing count of how many, before finally exhausting herself. The constant stream of tears from her eyes still flowing. She lay herself down in a forest, her tears forming a river that run through it, no longer with hope. Tiama was broken, hope for her people all but died with mate, on the day that he too tried to make way for their peaceable existence with man. \n\nWith great sorrow, she called out to her children, using her heart song to communicate her need. They arrived one by one over the next few days. Tiama knew that they must create a new plan, for separation was killing them entirely. They were weak alone, but strong when together, and Tiama planned to keep her children by her side from that moment on.

{"archived":false,"author":"Roedhip","body":"*The view screen flickered for a second before displaying a milky blue marble floating through space. Earth. The captain smiled to himself as he knew his mission had neared it's end. Throughout the ship bustle blossomed as it prepared to approach the planet. They were so close you could even see the burning, black trenches that scarred the surface.*\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYear: 2096\n\nEstimated Date: 2-7 March\n\nLocation: Old Paris\n\nWinfrey looked through his binoculars to survey the cityscape. From his perch atop a skysc#BADWORDS# in the inner suburbs he could easily see the archaic city centre, littered with rubble and decaying structures. The dim light of the sunset provided little vision. He spotted the Eiffel #BADWORDS#e sticking out of the Seine, using it as a reference point to find the 15th arrondis#BADWORDS#t. Gavin was adamant there was something useful there, though Winfrey always zoned out before Gavin could say what.\n\nThankfully there weren't any fires left in this part of Europe. Further north, in Scandinavia, there were apparently still vast swathes of forests and cities ablaze. Closer to the equator the heat had let the fires burn down everything in months, they were only gone because they'd run out of fuel. That's an interesting fact humanity learned, global fires don't have burning on only soil. Scientists were quite baffled, and incinerated, by this discovery all those years ago.\n\nAnyway, Winfrey had figured out a safe enough path to get from here to the edge of the 15th arrondis#BADWORDS#t, and had figured out all the main pathways within. He jumped off the side of the skysc#BADWORDS# and fell down towards the rest of the group. It had obviously been quite a strong building, two of the walls still stood to their full height and a decent chunk of the roof had been sturdy. Winfrey pulled a cord to activate a small parachute, slowing his descent before he lightly tapped on the ground.\n\n\"Can we get there?\" asked Gavin. His eyes showed a hope that was his defining characteristic, his face leaning forward in anticipation of an answer. His mouth moved some more, with a bit of frustration creeping into his face, as Winfrey observed him. Then Winfrey remembered that he'd been asked a question.\n\n\"Yes,\" came Winfrey's delayed response. \"Not too far either, only a kilometre or so to the edge of the arrondis#BADWORDS#t.\"\n\nGavin sighed and smiled. \"Well, at least you can take us places, Winfrey,\" he admitted. He called to the rest of the group, there were sixteen in all, and they all began picking up their bags. \"Lead the way,\" he said.\n\nWinfrey nodded and promptly skipped his way across the rubble and bedrock. Behind him Gavin and the others followed his footsteps, making sure not to trip and land on any of the twisted metal left by fallen skysc#BADWORDS#s. The light in the west faded into nothingness, the light in the north remaining present as ever. A series of whirs filled the immediate area as Gavin turned on on their night vision, the rubblescape now dotted with outlines projected from just above Gavin's head.\n\nWinfrey never understood how those drones worked. Gavin could seemingly make them do anything, one minute Winfrey would see one siphoning water out of a corridor and the next it would be playing music. There was a small thud as Winfrey jumped down from a small outcropping of residential debris onto a path left in the rubble by an old invention called roads. Though they had their flaws, such as being incinerated pretty quickly when foreign plasma-fire rained down, Winfrey appreciated the paths they had caused. If only you could still use all of them, instead of the handful wide enough to not be coated in just as much debris as any other route you could choose.\n\nIn the night sky a few stars slowly became visible. Winfrey wondered at them as he walked, taken in by the beauty of space. Humans had actually been out there, once. So had Winfrey. Winfrey grinned as he noticed an old satellite fly overhead, not many of them could still be seen but Winfrey knew where to look. Their numbers had been dwindling ever since the group first landed on Earth, more and more of the orbits decaying into suicidal paths of friction and fire.\n\n\"Winfrey,\" called Gavin, as he ran to catch up. \"I've identified the building we're looking for, you'll be able to recognise a map right?\"\n\nWinfrey nodded, recalling the map he'd made earlier atop the skysc#BADWORDS#. The outlined night vision disappeared as Gavin's drone instead projected a holographic map of Old Paris. This must have taken a lot of searching, you could tell by the lack of destruction and the small corporate \"g\" in one corner that this was an old map. Winfrey took it all in, trying to tell where everything was. Once he realised the small river was what the Seine used to look like he quickly got a grip of where everything was.\n\n\"This structure here,\" said Gavin as the hologram zoomed in on a long building. \"This is where we're headed. There should be plenty of supplies in there, maybe even a functioning comms system. They used to have links all the way to the colony moons in there.\"\n\nWinfrey eyes and mouth opened wide as he realised they'd finally being doing something related to space again. There were so many possibilities if this was an old space centre, they could even figure out how to talk to all the unmanned ships drifting through the Solar system if they were lucky. Gavin smirked as Winfrey excited himself.\n\n\"I knew you'd like it,\" smiled Gavin. \"And one other thing you'll find interesting, if a little disappointing. This isn't a road, it's a railway.\" Winfrey looked at Gavin, confused. \"Instead of lots of little vehicles running about they had these magnetic rails for big, long transport. A lot faster but more expensive.\"\n\nGavin gestured to begin moving forward again as he finished indulging in making Winfrey happy. The hologram disappeared as the night vision restarted, Winfrey leading the group further down the railway. Ahead the railway was coated with rubble from some old structure, so Winfrey climbed onto a small plateau to his left he'd noticed. The group stopped on this odd plateau to gaze at the sight. Gleaming metal filled the surroundings cracks and holes, Gavin's drone illuminating a rainbow of colours. This odd metallic scene stretched for quite a distance around and even Gavin was dumbfounded for a while.\n\n\"This,\" he speculated. \"Must be a car park. There could've been enough fuel in the centre of the city to melt the metal in the cars, so what we're seeing is their molten remains. Don't touch it by the way, you can never be certain whether old technology is toxic or not.\"\n\nIn not too long everyone had started moving again, and after a left turn and some more walking they'd found themselves by the husk of what Gavin had revealed used to be the European Space Agency's headquarters. Winfrey quickly found a way inside and then Gavin took the lead.\n\n((I'm going to finish this and get round to the actual prompt, don't worry. It's just quite long and my writing muscle is tired.))","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1416081620","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cm3g35f","link_id":"t3_2mdtcs","name":"t1_cm3g35f","parent_id":"t3_2mdtcs","retrieved_on":1426010022,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":9}

{"archived":false,"author":"reostra","body":"It's not a scam.  I get results, it's just that I have to make people think they've been scammed first.  Listen, here's how it works:\n\nEveryone wants to know what their power is.  Absolutely everyone.  Even the \"supers are the spawn of satan\" people have a power and even they want to know what it is.  I know because they've been my clients, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nEveryone wants to know what their power is, but few people are willing to do what it takes to find out.  Few, however, is not 'nobody'.  So yeah, you've got your jumpers who find a building just tall enough to grievously injure themselves, you've got the people who jump in front of trains, and of course people willing to put the phrase 'faster than a speeding bullet' to a rather gruesome test, but mostly everyone doesn't have the guts.  Given the failure rate of the above methods (turns out x-ray vision doesn't stop an oncoming train), you can't really blame them, but it does mean there's plenty of room for an enterprising man like myself.\n\nSee, you don't have to almost die to get your powers.  You just have to *think* you're going to die.  \"Secret\" government projects around the globe have this trick where they turn you into a super-soldier by strapping you into a centrifuge and spinning you around so hard you black out.  The results it gets are middling - the degree of danger is usually correlated to the strength of the power - but hey, half-ass superpowers are better than no-ass superpowers.\n\nI'm better than that.\n\nA few years back I almost died.  Yeah, as far as origin stories go, it's hardly original.  That's pretty much how everyone's starts.  But mine was a little different because of how it went down:  Car accident.  Okay, yes, that's also a big one, thirty thousand vehicle fatalities a year means lots of folks are going to find out they've got skin that can turn to steel or whatever.  Mine was different.\n\nT-boned by a pickup truck, and my car catches fire.  That's the first thing that hardly ever happens, movies lie - cars almost never burn up.  This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the accident had broken an arm and a leg.  Couldn't even drag myself to safety.  Second thing that hardly ever happens is that the driver - my brother, goes by the name Asbestos now, it's terrible but he doesn't listen - was thrown from the crash and doesn't die.  He's just fine.\n\nSo the car's on fire and I'm dying of blood loss or smoke inhalation or something, and he's trying to come back and get me but the fire's pretty damn big at this point, and he's yelling, \"I'm sorry man, I'm sorry!\"\n\nAnd I just yell back (and this is really impressive here, somehow my lungs still worked), \"You #BADWORDS# moron, you're immune to fire!\"\n\nAnd it turns out he is.\n\nThat's my power.  It's the power to know what other people's powers are, and to bring it out.  And in any other deadly situation I'd have learned that fact and died like so many other people without \"get me out of this deadly situation\" powers.  But that time the fates lined up and, after a lengthy and expensive hospital stay, I had a new life and a new job.\n\nI live the life of a con man, because that's what people have to think I am.  I trick them into thinking I can give them superpowers, and then I skip out with the money.\n\nThen, later, completely by coincidence, they're put in a situation where their specific power would save their life.  This is pretty easy for people with powers like regeneration or invulnerability, half the time they get themselves mugged before I can arrange one.  Other times it's hard - one lady had x-ray vision, so I had to arrange a full-on restaurant robbery complete with gunfire and a fire exit out back only visible through several walls.  The fact that the fire door was solid steel was helpful.\n\nWhy all the showmanship, you ask?  I could just tell people what their power is, and they'd have it, full strength, right?\n\nSure, if I want to get kidnapped by whatever country happens to have assets wherever I am.  Or killed by whatever countries can't have me.  I'm faster and cheaper than a centrifuge and I get better results.  I'm worth more than my weight in gold.\n\nSomeone knows, though.  Maybe my brother finally told the story at some point.  Maybe one of my clients got wise.  Either way, 'they' came for me just a week ago.  Black vans, SWAT gear, the works.  If I hadn't been out attempting to stalk a client down a long, straight alley (superspeed, it turns out) I'd have been toast.  I got the hell out of town.\n\nWhat do I do now?  Turns out I'm owed a few favors.  See, I have to make people think I'm a con man but a good con man can convince some pretty smart people.  And afterward, those people put the \"I'm going to give you superpowers\" scam and the fact that they got superpowers together, and they get me.  So I've got some former clients who're willing to help me out.  One of them's been a personal detective on my behalf for the week.\n\nWho's he following?  I think that's obvious at this point, don't you?  He's the one over there, at the bar, watching us.  He's been following you.\n\nWhy you?  That's simple.\n\nYou can hide people.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1416351499","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":3,"id":"cm6f9mb","link_id":"t3_2mpg02","name":"t1_cm6f9mb","parent_id":"t3_2mpg02","retrieved_on":1425959012,"score":2228,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2228}

Full of something that's not really anything at all. \n\n There's a draft in the room and it's seeping through my white gown at an alarmingly rapid rate, chilling me violently. Taking in more of the room i search for a window, or anything really. One simple scrap of familiarity, i call out for my friends; \"Holly? Jess? #BADWORDS# anybody?\"\n\nI wait for a reply, for any sort of sound to dull the hollow feeling that's blanketing me. That's blanketing this whole empty room. \n\n There's a feeling building steadily inside me, welling up it begins to flood over the sides as a sudden shot of terror tears through me.\n\n Screams rip from my body as i sprint straight at one of four blank walls and fight with everything i have. My hands and feet ache as i punch, slap, and kick, the pain almost as strong as my need to leave. Almost, but now quite. Every time I feel as though i'm almost out it solidifies before me. My nails catch in plasterboard and rip from their fragile foundations, my body a canvas of blood and frustrated tears. I drop to the floor- i just want out. \n\n I hear a light ding that seems to echo throughout the room and my head shoots up as i search frantically for the source. I see an antiquated mobile phone on the floor and i dart for it as quickly as possible, picking it up carefully in my abused hands. The phone is completely empty except for one message, 'Wake up.' I try to reply, to ring out as the phone dies before me, the last seconds of battery draining as the screen goes blank. I turn around and throw it as hard as i can at the wall- the wall that had been bare seconds before and now seemingly has a door.\n\n I rush for it giddy and terrified in equal measure, how is this even possible? I reach a hand out for the doorknob when a moment of hesitant, but complete certainty surges through me. I know that whatever happens when i open this door will completely change my life, i know it and i pull the door open anyway. \n\n My every sense feels as though it's been assaulted, the room is brighter than anything I've ever seen before and i blink rapidly attempting to make out more than just hazy shadows.

{"archived":false,"author":"GekkostatesOfAmerica","body":"The mask was surprisingly easy to come by. I figured I'd have to order the thing off Amazon and have to postpone the robbery for a few days while I waited for the thing to come in. Instead I found it, along with my buddy's, at the comic book store. Cheap too.\n\n\"You ready?\" David asks. His hands tighten on the steering wheel, anxious. His mask is on, and his voice comes out #BADWORDS#led by the cheap rubber.\n\n\"Yeah, J.B., you?\" I ask back. Dave nods. Show time.\n\nWith my empty briefcase in one hand, I open the door of the van and step onto the sidewalk. Immediately I get a few stares from people passing by, but the mask is common enough that they shake their heads in dismay. They're probably assuming I'm just some sort of hooligan. Oh no, I think, I'm far more than that.\n\nI enter through the two sets of front doors, my leather shoes clicking softly against the marble floor. To my right is the receptionist for appointments, and to my left is the line of tellers, hidden behind a tall wall of glass with speaker holes. You can see the old-style vault a few meters behind, opened just enough for customers to see the piles of cash that they show off.\n\nIt's worth noting that if the bank receptionist had any clue, she would have called for security the moment a masked man walked into the bank. But, like I'd hoped, the mask probably made her hesitate.\n\nIs he for real? She was probably thinking.\n\nThere are four other customers in the bank. One receptionist. Four tellers. There are probably other personnel around the corner, where the receptionist is, but I don't count them. They won't get in the way anyway. \n\nI don't stop, walking right to the first teller in the line. She is busy counting money, her eyes diverted from the face of her customer.\n\n\"Hi welcome to Bank of America, how can--\" she looks up into the barrel of a gun.\n\nI pull the trigger and thunder echoes throughout the bank. The teller is thrown back in her chair, the sudden weight tipping it over. For a split-second there is only stunned silence, then screaming.\n\nThe other tellers dive under their desks, and the customers head for the door. I grab a chair from the waiting area, shooting the glass a few more times before throwing it through. The glass rains down around the tellers and me, littering the floor with little knives.\n\nI jump over the counter and slip behind the vault door. Popping my suitcase open, I fill it with as much cash as will fit. Stuffing my pockets as well, I exit the vault and leap back over the counter.\n\nBooking it through the glass doors to the sidewalk, I notice some teenager with his phone out. He's probably recorded the whole thing. \n\nOh man, the mask will made this #BADWORDS# famous, I think.\n\n\"Stay in school, don't do drugs!\" I yell, just as Dave pulls up beside me in the van. I jump in the passenger seat. But before I can slam my door I hear that snarky teenager yell at me: \"Thanks Obama!\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're welcome.\" I retort. Then Dave hits the gas and we speed off.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1416592620","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cm947xh","link_id":"t3_2mzmci","name":"t1_cm947xh","parent_id":"t3_2mzmci","retrieved_on":1425909067,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

It's sad.\", the woman next to him said.\n\n\"The last time we hung out, we went to 7-11. He asked me to buy a soda for him because he was low on money. So I wait in line to buy everything and I see him filling out the forms for multiple lottery tickets. So I hand him the soda and told him if he's got money for lottery tickets, he can use his own damn money to buy his own soda.\" John sighs. \"Now I wish I would have just bought that soda for him. It was only two dollars!\"\n\nThe man behind pipes up, \"Andrew was an #BADWORDS#.\"\n\nJohn turns around, anger in his eyes. \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Andrew was an #BADWORDS#. Don't act like just because he died he was some kind of saint.\"\n\nJohn stands up and turns towards the man. \"This is his goddamn funeral.\"\n\nThe man is unfazed. \"Doesn't change that he was an #BADWORDS#. I'm his cousin for Christ's sake. That's why he was infected with the A-Hole virus.\"\n\nThe woman next to John pleads with the man. \"Please, this is a funeral. Have some respect. He died of the AH-Zero virus.\"\n\nThe man rolls his eyes. \"Yeah, the one that kills #BADWORDS#.\"\n\n\"He was my best friend and he may have had his faults, but he was still a goddamned human being.\"\n\n\"He was an #BADWORDS# and he's always been an #BADWORDS#. Even as kids. I broke my arm when he pushed me off my treehouse. He nearly took my eye out with a paintball once. Just last year, he borrowed my car, got drunk and totaled it. Andrew was an #BADWORDS#. The only reason why I'm here is to see him go into the ground.\"\n\nThe woman next to John,\"Please act appropriately. You may have had a problem with him but this is not the proper venue. This is a funeral.\"\n\nA middle aged man sitting further down from John and his girlfriend turns towards them and says,\"He ran over my dog and didn't even slow down afterwards. Just kept on driving.\" His eyes swell with tears. \"That was the only thing I had in my life since my wife died.\" \n\nJohn stands and addresses both of them.  \"What is the matter with both of you? This is a funeral. If you hated him so much, you shouldn't have come. Now be quiet before his parents hear you.\"\n\nJohn's girlfriend puts her head down and whispers,\"He touched me.\"\n\nJohn looks over at his girlfriend. \"What?\"\n\n\"He used to grope me when he got drunk and you weren't looking. He did it all the time. And he used to tell me the nasty things he'd like to do to me when you'd leave the room.\" John's girlfriend begins crying \"I didn't like him either.\"\n\nJohn balls both hands into a fist. \"That mother #BADWORDS#... \"\n\nJohn's girlfriend begins uncontrollably sobbing and looks up at John. \"I'm so sorry, baby.

Why are we doing this?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Mike?\"\n\nNothing.\n\n\"You know why they call it virus A, right.\"\n\nMike slammed his hands on the desk. \"For Gods sake Kerra, *of course* I know why they call it that! It's the #BADWORDS# #BADWORDS# virus alight. Everyone knows that. Look, can we just get on with the work please. We've practically got a functioning immunisation here. We're sitting on a gold mine.\"\n\nTen minutes passed before Kerra breached the topic again.\n\n\"I'm just saying, wouldn't the world be better off without a load of #BADWORDS# everywhere,  always messing it up?\" Mike shot her a warning glance. \n\n\"Cm'on Mike! Let's get real. Are you happy slaving away in here while some #BADWORDS# of a manager sits on their ass all day reaping the benefits?\"\n\nMike sighed. \"Look, I just think it's better if we don't think about that. There's a lot of money been put into this, alright. People are literally dying for it.\"\n\n\"#BADWORDS# are dying Mike, #BADWORDS#.\"\n\nThe word hung in the air.\n\n\"Look,\" Mike's voice went quiet. \"I've seriously considered destroying the sample and all of our work. Really..\" \n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And I'm scared, alright Kerra. Look, of course I'm sick of #BADWORDS# running this planet. I really am. I'm sick of smug #BADWORDS# walking all over the real hardworkers, the real thinkers. I'm sick of living in a world where a third of the planet lives under the rule of some dictator #BADWORDS#bag. I'm sick of hearing about war and murder. But I'm scared. I'm scared of what will happen if we sabotage the world's only hope at finding a cure for this virus.\"\n\n\"Scared?\" Kerra looked genuinely shocked.\"Scared of what? Scared of being punished? All the #BADWORDS# will be gone, Mike, no one'll want to punish you.\"\n\n\"No Kerra. I'm scared that.. That we'll become #BADWORDS#.\"\n\n\"Oh damn.\" The penny had dropped. That's why Mike hadn't said anything. He'd already thought it through, a lot more than she had by the sounds of things. \"Yeah, #BADWORDS#. I guess that could happen.\"\n\n\"I know.. What a #BADWORDS#ish thing to do eh? We'd effectively be signing the death sentence of a billion people\"\n\n\"A billion? That's a bit pessimistic.\"\n\n\"There's already 800 million, and the virus has barely penetrated China.\"\n\n\"Oh #BADWORDS#, yeah. There's quite a lot of #BADWORDS# there.\"\n\n\"Don't you think there's a chance the virus might decide that letting those people die was for the the greater good?\"\n\n\"I, I don't know Kerra. I mean, it's ridiculous enough to have a virus that only kills assshols. But this virus' definition of #BADWORDS# doesn't even seem to have any grounding in reasoned logic.  If anything it seems a bit racist. You heard about France right?\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No?! Well, they're all dead Kerra. Apparently every living human of French origin was an #BADWORDS#. What kind of twisted logic is that?\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with our moral dilema?\"\n\n'She still wants to go through with this,' thought Mike.\n\n\"I'm saying that we can't possible predict the logic of this virus. I have no idea what it's basing it's targets on.\"\n\n\"Look, I'm not taking the risk Kerra. But..\" \n\n\"But?\"\n\n\"But, it's getting late. And I think I'm starting to feel a bit ill, if you know what I mean.\" He winked at her. \"I'm going to go home now, and, er, I won't be coming back to finish this project. On account of being ill, of course.\"\n\n\"Mike..\"\n\n\"Look, you're right. The world *would* be better off without #BADWORDS#. But I don't have the balls to put my neck on the line for it.\"\n\nMike grabbed his coat off the hanger as Kerra sat slack-jawed.\n\n\"I hope you make the right decision, Kerra.\"\n\n\"Well #BADWORDS# Mike, that got serious - \" he slammed the door shut before she could even finish her sentence.\n\nSarah leaned back in her chair. She had some thinking to do.\n\n*2 weeks later*\n\nMike was struggling today. He couldn't help but feel that it was somehow his fault. Kerra had died, and she hadn't managed to save anything. The virus hadn't stopped. Of course it hadn't. He should of known that not *every* single Frenchmen was an #BADWORDS#. The virus had a warped opinion, and it just kept infecting more and more people. \n\nRecently it had gone after Mac users. Everyone could understand at first, it mainly seemed to go for those who'd always suggest that their friends by MacBooks instead of their perfectly fine HPs. They were #BADWORDS#, true. But every single Mac user? Well, they're all dead now.\n\nMike still looked back at that day. The day he had talked his friend into killing herself and dooming humanity. They hadn't been able to sal#BADWORDS#e the research. There was no one to do it. Everyone just sat at home  now, watching TV. No one talked anymore, too scared of being labelled an #BADWORDS#. \n\n'Oh well,' thought Mike, 'At least ComCast are gone.'\n\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1416609643","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cm9d796","link_id":"t3_2n02o6","name":"t1_cm9d796","parent_id":"t3_2n02o6","retrieved_on":1425904865,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

Sometimes when I get really feeling like, omagaw, I'mma die right now you guys for really, I can like get really mad and be super everything for a minute. I figured out how to do surgery on myself you guys for really.\n\nSo, I'm like, walking around all level 5 and #BADWORDS# and like at this point I barely even see humans because they've been trying to kill me for like ever and so I'm high all the time with those endorphins I was talking about because at level 5 like when I just got there and turned 5 I was all dreaming about like stats and I dumped a whole bunch of points in endorphins because that #BADWORDS# is the #BADWORDS#. 'Cept for the fact that I didn't know it wasn't just a dream, and it was a totes for really Stat point bonus dream. Omagaw. What the #BADWORDS#.\n\nSo I'm just going to spell this #BADWORDS# out here. I'm a kind of a tank because I'm a drug addict. That #BADWORDS# is hot. I was like I'm going to #BADWORDS# everyone because now when the police people get here I can just tank a bullet. Whoah, no. Because ma bonuses broke, and by that I mean my bones, and all I do is get high because I didn't go for healing, not really. I mean who expects their bones to break. So I went to the hospital and just came all over everything because they assumed someone else had put me under. Gross. I think they just wanted my level 5 booty. You know doctors are just like bigger nurses. Ain't no theoretical physics, just engineering, so who does the theory, whatever.\n\nThe other thing that happened when I just turned 5 was I started uh noticing other people who were at least level five. I freaked out. There are so many of us guys you don't even know. I saw one guy who had transcended existence and he was totes old and like Asian, but he had like a swirly of spirit eyes on his face and it was so beautiful and not ugly at all. He just cut people down with a sword made of doubt and addiction all over the place. I mean so many people are dying and anyone below 5 cannot see it. Their eyes aren't good enough yet, they're like re#BADWORDS#ed just kill some people.\n\nAnd then another thing happened. Maybe, it's hard to tell. My inside voice changed. Like the one in everybody's head, that tells them why they should and shouldn't kill people without an amulet. I barely notice them anymore so I dk what I'm going to say when some scrub asks me. LOL.

{"archived":false,"author":"cmlincoln","body":"“ My grandson Eli, you know the one with the big head, well when he was still in diapers he would ride Boris around in the front yard like a horse. He laid down on the dog's back and held on to its collar, a big grin on his face while old Boris just stomped around all the same. Diana and I would watch from this bench and not say a single word to each other. We would just watch.”\n\t\nUntil this point, Carter had been moving his hands and face right along with every dip and #BADWORDS#e in this old story. But now, he just looked out at his yard with an open smile, letting out a small pulse of air with every silent laugh. His profile was still and serene. I had seen his face a million times before this, but it had never looked that damn genuine.\n\t\n“ You would have gotten a better look if this tree was out of the way” I lamented, leaning into him with my wide grin “ This thing still looks the same. I remember when you two first moved in and set up the kiddie swing on the near branch. I wish the part 30 years were ask kind to me as they were to your tree.”\n\t\nI could tell Carter was getting more sombre. When you get to be our age, all you do is talk about the past. You begin to feel your mortality. Soldiers are awful good at telling stories, but this sentimentality, this flux of emotion that comes with retelling a memory is new to both of us. \n\t\n“ Reggie. I've seen a lot of things come and go in my life. Countless men in the war died surrounded by unfamiliarity and confusion. We got to come back home, God knows why, and we got another chance to appreciate the pillars in our life. I watched by kids grow up in this house, I married Diana in this house, and I got to sit outside of this house and just watch the seasons change. The kids grew  up and moved away, Diana passed after a long, beautiful life, and I am left alone in this shell. Every damn day for the past 30 years I looked out my kitchen window and I saw that tree planted firmly in the front yard. Last month the city comes to my house and says my tree's roots are messing with the underground pipes on the block, and they gotta cut it down. Now Reggie you gotta understand, guys like us, we need stability, we need something to lean on when we don't think we can stand on our own. I don't have my wife, I don't have my family, I don't have my dog; This house is my museum for them. The only thing I’ve got is that damn tree.”\n\t\nI wanted to stop him so bad. I wanted to take him to my house and let my wife cook us a brisket and then watch the ball game. I wanted to tell him this is a part of life. But, I just waited for him to finish. I could see his lips quiver.\n\t\n“ If the city thinks they are gonna take away the last pillar of my life, then they don't understand what I did for this country, what we did for this country, Reggie. Those eggheads think they can tell me what is and is not mine. They don't understand familiarity. They don't understand routine. Some men snap when they don't have something to lean on; something to prop them up. I'm not letting them take my tree, Reggie. I just plain ain’t gonna let them.”\n\t\nWe continued to sit on the bench in Carter's front yard for a while longer. We both were silence. He glared at the ground a foot in front of his feet, hands clenched into fists. I stared clear into his neighbors porch where a woman was watering her flowers. Back when he first moved in, I could never see that house. But now, today, I had a very clear view.

{"archived":false,"author":"Mazon_Del","body":"Director Jenkins sighed as he sat back in his plush office chair. \"Finally.\" he says looking down at the screen in front of him, his fingerprint fading out from the pad. The words \"Welcome Back Director Jenkins\" gently flashed on the screen before fading away to the familiar and much missed NSA logo. The last year had been an interesting time for Jenkins. Due to a snafu in the new GovNet computing system, he had been forced to work as the director of NASA for a full year. While working for NASA had admittedly always been a boyhood dream of Jenkins, he had never really intended for it to happen. Unfortunately there was nothing to be done. The system would not accept a change of director of a major post twice in less than a year. The system determined his access permissions, his funding levels, everything. He came in every morning to headquarters, closed his door...and ran NASA...\n\nAt first there had been rage. So much had been planned, and certainly a dreamer like Director Carter would give into the temptation to reveal all of the programs in the NSA's pocket. Jenkins had sat there for a few days, expecting to hear CNN announcing revelations left and right. It would be worse than the Snowden leak all those years ago. But as the days dragged on...nothing... Slowly Jenkins came to realize that Carter had resigned herself to doing her job, just as he should his.\n\nThen there had been depression. As he poked at his growing email list of the concerns of his 'new' employees and the day to day task of running a space program he couldn't help but sink into a quagmire of depression. 'How is it that people so smart can be so stupid?' he had thought to himself as he sat through a budget meeting. There was such waste EVERYWHERE. Oh not the kind most people think of. NASA ran as lean as was possible for a cash strapped agency could. What they wasted though was all the opportunities to squeeze out extra cash from their sources.\n\nHe started distracting himself from his depression by tossing out some tweaks here and there. Starting slow, mostly because he felt he couldn't be bothered. A few tweaks to the payroll database justified by 'compe#BADWORDS#ve practices' clauses. Suddenly the agency had a couple extra million, and the accountants that would notice were receiving enough of a salary to keep quiet. He had felt a slight shiver down his spine as the changes had gone through. This reminded him of his early days in the NSA, finding money from nowhere to expand the funds available for the projects the NSA undertook without anyone being the wiser. With a slight smirk he cracked his knuckles and decided to see just how naive these 'geniuses' had been with their money...\n\nWithin a week he had claimed most of the low hanging fruit. Quick stuff really. He'd set into motion a few other things that would take a few weeks or months to run their course. But now that he had his groove back on, he dove in with a passion. But already he'd managed to expand his pool of 'discretionary funds' to about a billion dollars. Money piling up in the NASA accounts that nobody knew existed. He looked into the technologies that NASA was investigating or utilizing and he couldn't help but laugh. Yet again, wasted opportunities abound! He knew from his intelligence reports on several nations that their homebrew rocketry programs were reaching certain milestones. It was a simple matter to arrange for technology sales to the right people.\n\nA classic example of utilizing an enemies compartmentalization against themselves. India's most advanced systems were of course a tightly held secret. Their intelligence services would be unaware that the papers they were purchasing would be largely useless by the time they filtered around to the scientists. Was he cir#BADWORDS#venting tech embargos and trade restrictions? Technically yes, but if it should ever come to light, the fact that he knew that nothing new was being revealed would tie up the courts long enough for the matter to drop. Plus, he managed to snag an extra couple billion from the various targeted nations.\n\nAs funds became available he looked for worthy investments. It didn't take too long to figure out what would achieve the most in the shortest amount of time. Funds were shifted around, priorities established. Everything nice and quiet of course, it wouldn't do for others to question NASA's sudden shifting around. It would just be so much simpler to keep everything in the shadows. Over the next several months there was a flurry of activity throughout the space agency. Unfortunately there were quite a few issues with some of the satellites to be launched. Nothing NASA's fault of course, but as a result, launch priorities were pushed back, flight vehicles reassigned. Nobody really noticed the strange orbital paths that the new projects were taking. At least, nobody that could interfere with his funding.\n\nEight months after taking the job and he felt like a chess grandmaster showing a young whelp what for as he looked through the recent photographs to reach his desk. Several dozen rovers had been landed on the moon, all in the same location. With typical NASA precision, all of them had managed to land inside the sunken cave he had chosen. Carefully and meticulously these rovers had sucked in the lunar regolith and printed out what he needed. Assembling systems layer by layer. The vertical cave mouth looked the same in the current orbital images...and so it should. But the next images he had were from the landing systems on the lander...the MANNED lander. It descended towards the cave mouth, but the entrance had a strange warped visual to it. But it became clear in the next image as the false cave-mouth swiveled out of the way for the lander to enter the base. \n\nIn a few short months the printers had managed to construct an underground base the likes of which mankind had never produced. It could support a crew of twenty indefinitely. Enough manufacturing gear had already been loaded into the base to allow it to produce whatever it might need to keep itself going. Which is good, because when the next fifty workers showed up, production on mankinds first interplanetary spaceship would begin. Nothing like the Orion, the Constellation, or those other 'ships'. Those were just kinetic trash cans compared with what this facility would produce. The initial costs had largely wiped his hidden funding, but that was fine. The base would begin in situ resource utilization and would shortly need nothing from Earth. Which would help keep it hidden.\n\n[Continue]","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1416818745","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmbg9ip","link_id":"t3_2n8ir6","name":"t1_cmbg9ip","parent_id":"t3_2n8ir6","retrieved_on":1425868640,"score":60,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":60}

He hadn't meant to look at her, only intended to give her a passing glance as he continued on his way, but he found it more difficult than expected.\n\nShe was pretty, strikingly so, with dark brown hair done up in a messily intricate combination of braid and ponytail. Loose strands framed her face in waves and curls and emphasized her teasingly inquisitive eyes. But it wasn't her face that made him stop, rather her clothes. \n\nThe woman wore a canvas skirt that fell past her knees. Beneath the hemline, two deep brown military boots sat, revealing only a bit of calf in the pleats when she moved in just the right way. She wore a plain blouse which didn't show off any of her breasts save for the pleasant swell beneath the off white, and even that was covered by a thin scarf looped around her neck. \n\nIt wasn't at all sexy. Still, there was something *#BADWORDS#* there, an alluring pull that Death couldn't deny. She seemed comfortable and her expression spoke of a sensual authority, which suggested sex in a smoky, forbidden kind of way.\n\nHe hadn't thought... not until she hiked up that long skirt of hers and flashed him milky thighs in the neon bath of the store sign that she took refuge under. \"Hey handsome,\" she called-- and that was when he realized. Death always took a form that meant something to his target, usually someone they feared or felt guilt or debt towards, and at the moment he was an old man dressed in an ill-fitting suit with a nearly disappeared hairline and a pronounced beer gut. \"You interested?\"\n\nHe had to admit he was tempted. Her look recalled ancient memories within him and a stirring he'd never felt. \"I have never--\" he replied before he knew what he was doing. \n\nShe gave him a sultry smile. \"It's okay, I'll show you.\" And there it was again, that authority that had him feeling an entirely unfamiliar pull. \n\n\"Alright.\" And she did, her lithe form dragging across his body in ways that made every bit of him stand on edge. Death felt so out of place. She was beautiful, unlike any #BADWORDS#-- any woman he'd seen, and he was a foul beast of a man. He found himself wishing he'd taken a different form, something that would please her. He wanted to please her. But when she kissed him and rolled her hips, he forgot all of it and was lost in the heat of her body.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked later that night, the words falling off his tongue in time with his heartbeat-- God it felt nice to have a heartbeat. He'd never known.\n\nShe looked over at him as she lit a cigarette and her answer made his cheeks pale. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he stammered out. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\nDeath whispered her name, tongue curling reverently around the syllables. \"It's your time. I have to take you away.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know.\" The woman took a long drag and released the smoke in a slow, purposeful exhale. \"I've always had daddy issues.\"\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1416849846","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmbpoma","link_id":"t3_2n7o67","name":"t1_cmbpoma","parent_id":"t3_2n7o67","retrieved_on":1425864147,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Of course she knew she couldn't physically stop me. I was ten pints of cider deep and felt the power coursing through my body, just as I felt my mind swimming in a drunken fog. Pointing out into the street I said \"Gotta go save all the people.\" It sounded courageous in my head, to her it just sounded like a drunken idiot about to go out and get himself into yet another mess. Her brows furrowed deeper as she spoke yet more words of protest \"You can't, the mayor said from now on the police are to treat you as a vigilante, a law breaker; you can't go out there while you're powered up!\" I was paying her less and less heed, my flesh was turning to bone reinforced scales, my teeth turning to fangs and a tail ripped out through the back of my stained sweatpants.

But it wasn’t. It was, in fact, the beginning. The beginning of something wonderful in her mind, but in actuality it was an entirely different beginning.\n\nWhen she remembers the incident, it plays through her mind just like a movie. The glass shatters, pieces flying in slow motion through the air. Her chest heaves into her seatbelt, head heading towards the steering wheel, a puff of white appearing from the center. She can vividly hear the crunching metal as the roof of the car moved down towards her, puffs of white now entering her peripheral vision.\n\nShe should have been dead. But warm, golden hands scooped her up and flew her out of the car, straight through the glass of the front window hanging in midair. The glass cut and imbued itself in her skin, but as long as she was in his arms she felt no pain. She looked up into her savior’s face, shining brightly, and saw the most handsome man ever. Against her will, he lowered her down to the ground. As his hands left her, the pain ricocheted through her body. She saw the large, golden white wings sprout from his back, and then he was gone, like a wisp of air.\n\nShe knew she loved him. His touch, the beat of his heart. She could still feel it pulsating as her head laid against his chest, pulling her from the rubble of that fateful car wreck. She’d know the man she was in love with anywhere, even if he happened to be her guardian angel.\n\nA few weeks later, drunk and desperate after he refused to appear, she jumped off of the local bridge, only to feel the warmth of his arms again. He flew her to the shore and safety. This time he appeared angry before he left. She pleaded with him to stay, but like the last time he was gone.\n\nOnly a few days passed this time, no word from her guardian angel. Doors locked, she sat on her bed and held the razor. And then, slowly and carefully, she began to cut her wrist. Sparks flew as the razor came into contact with something tougher than her skin, the metal breaking off. A tiny spark of her blood appeared on her guardian angel’s finger.\n\n“Stay,” she pleaded. On her knees, she looked into his eyes, begged that he might stay if only a moment longer. “Please. Stay with me! I love you. I love you. I don’t even know why. But I love you!”\n\nTears streamed from the angel’s eyes as he disappeared again. Distraught, the women laid on her back, vowing to never see her guardian angel ever again. She hated him, she insisted to herself.\n\nBut her hate didn’t last very long. For this time she was looking at the oncoming car, stunned at what she had done. The child was now on the side of the road, pushed out of the way just in time, but she wasn’t so lucky as the car struck her instead. She felt her body go limp as it flipped up onto the car’s windshield and rolled back off onto the street. But those same, warm hands gripped her yet again on her way back to the pavement.\n\nThis time, though, she felt herself being carried towards the heavens. As she looked back down at the ground, she saw her corpse laying there, the driver distraught over what he had done. She looked up into her guardian angel’s face. Sleek and handsome. And then she really remembered what had happened.\n\n“I knew you before, didn’t I?” she said to the angel as they soared through a cloud. “You were… Who were you?”\n\n“Your husband,” the angel said in a deep, soothing voice. “I was drunk one night, we were on a date, I drove, and in the end nearly got you killed. The accident wrecked your memory. I swore that I’d never let you get hurt like that again.”\n\nThe woman stared, trying to remember. But nothing came to her, even now in death.\n\n“Why can’t I remember?” she asked.\n\n“You will in time,” the angel said. “Trust me on that.”\n\n“I remember that I love you,” she said, getting lost in his warm, brown eyes. “I know that I love you.

{"archived":false,"author":"Blagerthor","body":"*Note: It only works with rereading the first segment after reading the last*\n\n\nJonathan never understood Cheryl the way I did. How could he? I've known Cheryl since she was five! He's only known her since she moved away to college. I try talking to her every now and then, but if I'm honest with myself, we really started to drift apart during high school. It wasn't cool for me to hang out with her anymore. But any time she had a bad day, I was there when her backstabbing \"friends\" weren't. She confided in me. And then it was all fine, after all, I didn't have sympathy for those who hurt my friend.\n\nI-I think it's hard to say, but I love her. She's my entire world. Sure I knew other people, but it was always Cheryl who gave me the greatest joy. I hurt when she got her first boyfriend, but hey, I also saw her through her first breakup. I never had any sympathy for those who hurt Cheryl. I never really liked her choice of pets either. Dogs. Too needy. \n\nBut Jonathan. Something is different about him. She loves him. Anyone who sees them together can tell that. This is the first time in five years that Cheryl has spoken to me. Five years ago me told me all about her husband-to-be and something about a picture of me. To be honest, I don't think I can live without her, but I'm here for her even if she does only talk to me every so often, now. And she's really hurting now. And sometimes you should be afraid of things that go bump in the night, because I never had any sympathy for those who hurt Cheryl.\n*****************************************************************\n**Jonathan**\n\nCheryl was the best thing to ever happen to me. Funny, creative, compassionate and adventurous, she was my dream girl. We met through a mutual friend in college and had been inseparable ever since. Which is why I went away this weekend. I had thought about it for months before I decided I didn't want to ever lose her. So, call me old fashioned, but I went back to her parent's and asked her father for his blessing. And his blessing I did receive! \n\n\"Cheryl, come here hun-bun!\" I called out, \"I have something to show you!\"\n\nI heard some scampering around in our bedroom and soon after the door popped open. And there she was, the love of my life! She practically threw herself at me, even though she was only dressed in socks and one of my shirts. \n\n\"Cheryl, I know you thought I went to my parents' house this weekend, but I actually went to your parents'.\" I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring just like I had practiced, \"And I asked them for your hand. Cheryl Rubenthal, will you make me the happiest man on Earth?\"\n\nShe was stunned silent. Her answer was a barrage of kisses and her quickly squeaking out, \"Yes! Yes! Yes! Of course, yes!\"\n\nA few hours later, after the excitement died down and the appropriate relatives were called, I brought up something else that her parents had given me. We were sitting on the couch now, watching some old re-runs of some sitcom or other when it struck me. I shoved my hand down into my pocket and pulled out the crumpled up piece of paper.\n\n\"Hey hun,\" I nudged, \"Your parents wanted to give this to you as well. Said it had some meaning for you.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"Can't be!\" She #BADWORDS#ed the paper from my hand and quickly unwrinkled it. \"It is! Oh my gosh, it's a drawing of my friend from childhood! Yup, same mousy hair and the eyes and everything! Thank you hun, thank you!\"\n\n\n***********************************************************************\n**Cheryl**\n\n\"Johnny! I'm back!\" I shut the door to our house with the heel of my shoe. Jonathan had been away at his parents' house for the weekend. And now he was back home from work. I heard some rustling upstairs and down came Jonathan, in his boxers and that was it.\n\n\"Couldn't wait to get back in your own bed, huh?\" I teased.\n\n\"Cheryl, I--\" Jonathan began, but he was interrupted by another voice.\n\n\"Johnny, baby, are you coming back to bed? I told you, it was just the wind!\"\n\n\"*Johnny baby*, you've got a lot of thinking to do.\" The next few minutes blur together in my memory. I think I hit him and dragged that #BADWORDS# out of his bed. They left in his car. I could really use a friend right now. But Jonathan was my only friend for so long, I'm not sure I could--Wait. Him. He always cared for me. And it's so easy to call him up. Just a matter of thought, really.\n\n*Hello Cheryl, it's been a long time. Five years, is it? How's Jonathan. No need to tell me, I already know. Remember how you vented to me about those girls in high school? That jerk who broke your heart? How those troubles just...went up in smoke...Tell me all about what Jonathan has done. Your imaginary friend is always happy to help*\n\nHe looked just like the picture and just like I remembered. Red eyes. Ears of a mouse. Everything, just as I remember. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1417145521","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmf07xn","link_id":"t3_2nml9k","name":"t1_cmf07xn","parent_id":"t3_2nml9k","retrieved_on":1425807420,"score":17,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":17}

{"archived":false,"author":"miri09","body":"It's dark, and damp, and one of those nights where the air feels like dew, all wet and thick. Me, I'm trudging through the grass and trying to ignore the fact that all I want to do is pop off my shoes and let the blades tickle my toes. I could do that. There's nobody to judge me. There's nobody to tell me no. Inwardly, I repeat the mantra that I've allowed to ring through my head since the divorce: *I am a wonderful human being; I am a successful man; nobody can judge me but me*.\n\nIt was tough. The divorce, I mean. And only because I'd dedicated so much of my life to him. We met in college and I was infatuated - him, it took a little convincing. But eventually apprehensiveness and infatuation morphed into love. We built a life together, first a little condo in the big city, and then the cabin out here for those summer nights when the air feels like dew. My career, his career, my family, his family - we maneuvered through the obstacles. We were in love; we were endgame. And when you feel like that about someone... well, you can't deny that they become a part of you. Good and bad.\n\nHe was a judgemental #BADWORDS#. And a control freak. If he would see me right now, throwing my loafers to the side, the socks crumpled in a heap and tossed somewhere towards the porch, he would come out and roll his eyes and call me an idiot. Or - he did this thing, when he was amused with me. He'd kind of run his fingers through my hair, fix me with this crooked sort of look, a lopsided grin. Like I was a curio in a museum. Like I was the most fascinating creature he ever laid his eyes on.\n\nAnd I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the dark, damp, dewy summer night. Maybe it's the blades of grass tickling my toes. Maybe it's the cabin out here, or the condo in the suburbs, or the fact that I won't see him in either of them ever again. But - for the first time since he caught me cheating, for the first time since he fixed me with his cold glare in the courthouse, I don't know, but I really *#BADWORDS#* miss him. My throat feels dry, painful. My eyes pinch. My chest has dropped down into my stomach, which is crawling through my body. And fleetingly, I run my fingers through my hair, pausing at the knot at the nape of my neck like he used to do. And it's sad. And if he were here watching this, he'd roll his eyes and call me an idiot.\n\nBut he's not. And okay, fine. Maybe I am a wonderful human being. But I also cheated on my husband. And maybe he is a judgemental #BADWORDS#. But he also promised to love me forever, and kept it. And maybe you can be both wonderful and terrible at the same time.\n\nAnd so here I am, in the middle of the clearing in front of our cottage, running my fingers through my hair and pausing at the knot at my temple like he used to do, having a #BADWORDS# epiphany. I don't know how long I'm going to stand here, watching the mental image of my ex husband rolling his eyes at me and calling me an idiot. But eventually, I pick up my sneakers from wherever they had landed, and resolve not to even look for the socks. I put the mental image of him to bed. And not long after, I follow suit. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1417193919","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmfddfz","link_id":"t3_2nmapt","name":"t1_cmfddfz","parent_id":"t3_2nmapt","retrieved_on":1425801212,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":5}

You don't care about that anymore?\" Che asked, the disbelief evident in his voice over the phone.\n\n\"Of course I do, don't say that. I just don't see any more point in such demonstrations anymore. I mean Needala-\" and the phone cut off.\n\nI felt angry at my exhausted self. *Why do I always forget to say Nee, our codename for him?! Of course it gets disconnected at that because the insecure idiot can't stand any talk about him.*\n\nPutting my phone aside, I gently ran my hands up and down my rather sore legs as they soaked in the hot water. While doing so, as a rational and logical person, I once again opened my mind to the possibility of going to the rally once more. However, I quickly decided that despite having maintained my fitness for years, there was literally no use going to any more of those protests. \n\nFirst, you were only allowed to chant anti-dictatorship slogans five times collectively. Second, the demonstration could not move at all from one giant circle and had to stay and bulk up in one place. Third, we could not make a video because mobile phones were not allowed. The only press that was there, was of the government's channel, with the cameraman muting the mic throughout the protests and focusing and zooming the camera on the body parts of whichever girl came into the view. Last but certainly the most ridiculous, you had to stand on one leg throughout. ONE LEG! Sure, you could shift which leg you stood on but had to jump up for it. If at any point in that giant circle you stood on both legs even for a second, one of the plain-clothed policemen mixed up in the demonstration would always catch that movement and take you away for 'questioning'. That's how I lost Zevach and Ledif yes#BADWORDS#ay.\n\nI sighed and felt sorry for not just my legs but also for all the demonstrators' legs that would be gathering at the central plaza right about now. Getting up, I dried myself with the towel nearby and went to the TV lounge.\n\n\"Open TV to Channel Needala News\" I commanded.\n\nThe tv opened up to that channel just when the cameraman was zooming into the bosom of a... a... guy?! *Yep, moobs. Stupid dude can't even do the dumb job he's assigned to do properly.* There was no sound obviously but as he zoomed out, I could make out the faces of a few of my friends entering the circle on one leg. *It's about to begin in ten minutes or so, I guess.* A rather beautiful girl walked by the camera and I was pleasantly surprised the cameraman did not choose to zoom into her clea#BADWORDS#e. However, to my disgust, he did end up zooming in on her ass. *Typical.*\n\nTen minutes had almost come and gone when quite suddenly the TV went out. It came back with the voice of a robotic female saying \"You have completed your monthly viewing time of Channel Needala News. You will now be switched to the do#BADWORDS#entary, The Life and Adventures of President Needala. Thank you.\" I let out a groan as the smiling face of my least favourite person in the world came onto the screen.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1417256262","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmg1a6y","link_id":"t3_2nqub3","name":"t1_cmg1a6y","parent_id":"t3_2nqub3","retrieved_on":1425772119,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":false,"author":"Quantumquandary","body":"Our best astrobiologists said we would most likely find some form of them on many planets. They were elegant yet simple, evolved early and were sturdy little creatures. On Earth, we nearly forgot they existed. Losing touch with the fact they even posessed a form of life, we exploited their resources and tranformed them into monstrosities. If there was a Mother Earth, she wept at our self-proclaimed advancement. \n\nAs humans we crawled on their backs until we found our iron legs. Our lives grew longer and thus our contributions to the future were grander. One had the time to develop the great ideas that would fuel our future. We had become the king of the proverbial hill so we build mega-cities on the hill. Our weight was felt heavily by our home, yet she continued to nourish our growth. \n\nThen we grew older. Average life spans were growing toward the triple digits. Our species was ready to move out of the house, to find another hill. We harnessed much of what we had left to get us here. We thought that it was best for our planet to recover after our destructive stint as main tenant so we took what we could and left her to lick her wounds. Many species went extinct. Others filled the gaps and grew. Darwin would have filled libraries. \n\nWe left. Simple as that. Every soul who could fit onto a ship scrambled with their tiny bags, filled with family photos and childs toys, up ramps threatening to close. We squeezed into corners and climbed into ceilings. This was the Exodus. Never to look back, we set off to colonize the new worlds we found for ourselves.\n\nWe had seven choices. Seven worlds to call home. Each human was to decide which planet they wanted to try a life on. I say try because nothing was a guarantee. These seven worlds were to be our new start. \n\nContact between worlds was minimal at best. Once a population established basic needs the rest of the fleet moved on to the remaining worlds. We were left to our own devices, so having resources already on the planet was a selling point for four of the seven worlds. The remaining worlds wound up being inhabited by the adrenaline junkies who wanted to live on the edge. Those three worlds did not see our species for long. Turns out living on other planets is pretty difficult. Who knew?\n\nEstablishing an average life span was impossible for the first few generations; too many variables. Once things began to come together we learned that we were aging faster than at any time in the previous century, even with our advanced medical technology. Of course we saw this as a massive problem, so we threw our best scientific minds at the problem. One after the other they came back with the same conclusion: we have absolutely no idea. \n\nSo we took our four worlds and carved our new existence, forgot about living long lives and just worried about surviving. We even got pretty good at it at times. Advacements were being made. New technologies and scientific fields grew from discoveries on our new homes. Most accepted and even loved their planet. Some, however, were a bit more nostalgic.\n\nA few small groups of like-minded people found eachother, and in that an idea. They would venture back to our Mother Earth to see how she fared after our departure. We'd been gone for nearly a millenium, surely things were beginning to look like they had before we began to use what was not ours. We sent along some of our top minds to gather data and compare things there to our current environment in order to solve the aging problem. What they found we never could have guessed.\n\nThe images we saw seemed familiar. We had all seen them in the textbooks in school, when we learned about our heritage on our home planet. They were everywhere. Endless oceans of static creatures. All seemed normal, until we saw the first explorer standing next to one. It was massive. They were all hulking giants. \n\nWhen we left the planet a very large hole needed to be filled, and they moved right in with almost no effort. We had created the perfect conditions for them to thrive and we left the door wide open for them. \n\nEveryone wanted murals of the new landscape. Some spoke of vacations or safaris. The daydreaming continued for some time until new images began appearing. Those who went back to Earth were doing something out species was never able to do before. \n\nA small group of scientists were sitting in a circle in a clearing. They were about 5 feet off the ground. Two engineers were tossing a ball of plasma back and forth, changing its color each time. As each group went to another with their news they began to teach their newfound abilities to eachother. Each meeting saw new things to change their lives. \n\nThey forgot about all of the live streams while they gallavanted in the wild, like children who just learned to walk. After the excitement waned the scientists began to seek answers and it was not long before we learned what we sought out to find. Little did we know that it would also answer many other questions, both past and future. \n\nSome initially thought it was the specific makeup of the Earths atmosphere, but they were thinking far too small. We thrived alongside countless species and exploited many others when we were there. Not once did we think we were in a symbiotic relationship with any of them. \n\nThe technology we developed during our time away from Earth allowed us new insight into the home we left behind. It was the air, but not the gases that make it up. \n\nIt was the plant life. The most benign and seemingly unintelligent branch of the tree of life, and they were helping us the whole time. They consume CO2 and release O2. Animals consume O2 and release CO2. We just never thought that the plant life would nurture and encourage out growth for its own benefit. They release a compound that slows cell death just in order to increase the amount of CO2 any given cell can release, thus increasing the energy supply for plant life. \n\nWhen we left, they had to compensate. We left thousands upon thousands of square miles for them to reclaim, buy they needed the energy to do that. Without billions of humans to create CO2 for them, the plants begin to release more amounts of the compound to meet their needs. \n\nBy the time humans returned the atmosphere was saturated with this miracle of in#BADWORDS#ependence. So much of it was in the air that after prolonged exposure the cells in the body began to use it not just to keep themselves alive longer but to unlock hidden potential. \n\nFor all of our technology and advancement, we were the very first domesticated species. Humans. By the #BADWORDS# plants.

C'mon! We've got a blimp to catch!\"\n\nI grabbed on to the back of the Avian as it flew towards the ship. When we reached the hull, I jumped off and shouted, \"I'm glad you're alive, but I've got some bad news.\"\n\nHe frowned, \"What is it?\"\n\n\"This artifact, the way it was made, requires a large catalyst in order to work: Specifically the life of whomever wields it. Old friend, this will be the last time we see each other.\"\n\n\"When were you planning on telling me this! Surely there is another way!\"\n\n\"There is none. If this force reaches the capital, everyone's dead. I was a coward and should have told you sooner. I'm sorry.\" With that, I ran into the hull of the ship. I heard him call out to me as I ran. I didn't catch what he said, but it didn't matter. People were counting on us. I had to pull this off.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1417854578","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmmsw2h","link_id":"t3_2oawp2","name":"t1_cmmsw2h","parent_id":"t3_2oawp2","retrieved_on":1425576384,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"what_eve","body":"Danny starts singing to the beat of *Mary had a little lamb*, \"Two boogers had a walk in sand\" The two boys laughed heartily at the word *boogers*. Joey jumps in to complete the next part of the song, \"Its footprints didn't show\". \"Everywhere that boogers went, the sand was sure to go\"\n\nJoey was crying with laughter at this point. He continued to draw connecting triangles on the side walk, dripping some of his tears on the chalk. Danny was really good at making up songs. He was his best friend.\n\nDanny suddenly shouts \"HULK SMASH!\" and erases part of the circle he was drawing with a roar. In rubbing his hand over the sidewalk, he got a deep cut from glass that he hadn't noticed. It didn't really hurt since he knew he was a big boy and it shouldn't. It sure was bleeding a lot, though. \n\n\"Whoa! That's so cool!\" declared Joey, as blood began dripping in a pretty shape on the ground from Danny's hand. \"Everywhere that blood drips, the sand was sure to show.\" again to the tune of \"Mary had a little lamb.\" \n\nDanny liked this new version of their song. He felt really manly now too. Holding his hand up and dripping in one spot, he added to the song. \"The puddle gets bigger, which was against the rule.\" Joey added the next part, \"It made the children laugh and play to see blood in a pool!\" He was so proud to make a rhyme. He put his hand in the small amount of blood and placed his hand next to the puddle to make a print.\n\nThe earth beneath his hand began to rise slightly. He pulled back frightened by the movement. The print that should have been there, was instead, a tiny red man. Well, kind of like a man. A tiny voice emanated from the shape. \"Dryendor at your service master.\" The tiny voice was hilarious to the boys so it took away all of the fear.\n\nThe laughter made Dryendor a little upset but he understood. He had never been summoned with so little blood and tears before. Dryendor walked over to the pool of blood nearby and absorbed it to grow a bit larger. At the sight, the boys were really excited. \"Joey! It's a new walking toy!\"\n\n\"I am no toy, child.\" His voice a bit lower pitched but still higher than a child that had inhaled helium. The laughter that erupted from the boys after frustrated Dryendor. \"I am here to do your bidding, masters, but you will need to take me seriously!\"\n\nDanny was so excited to have made something real! \"Okay, okay. Draw a pony.\" \"As you wish, master.\"\n\nAs Dryendor began drawing a pony with a nearby piece of chalk, he began resigning himself to the fact that these boys would not be able to return him to his slumber once he completed the task they requested of him. He would dissipate over the next few days and finally have sweet, sweet release. He sighed quietly, happy for the first time in his lifetime.

{"archived":false,"author":"CocacolaDrinker","body":"There appears to be a link between this guy’s lack of lack of fashion sense and the incoherent nonsense he’s spewing.  He’s about six foot give or take and his hair seems to be trying to escape down his back. He looks down his nose at me through a pair of hideous glasses, lenses as thick as the bottom of a milk bottle, with a wired frame that wraps around his ears. His mouth seems to never stop moving and the words are just none existent to me. I let out a long audible sigh as I roll my eyes. \n\n“Am I boring you Mr. Walters?” He said with a condescending tone.\nI sat up properly on the sofa and looked to the side of me. Sitting next to me was my best friend, wrapped in black shaking his head. \n\n“Look, I just don’t think we can solve our differences.” I said as I folded my arms. \n\n“To be honest, whoever said that I wanted too?”\nMy friend sighs, pulling back his hood, he looks directly into my eyes. \n\n“Is that really how you’re going to be? I want to fix this, don’t you? Surely that’s why we’re here.” He said with a voice that seemed so alien to me now. \n\n“I’m here because you forced me here, that’s all.” I unfold my arms and slouch back into the sofa. My friend does the same and mumbles to himself. \n\n“Well, let’s try and work this out.” The the#BADWORDS# leaned closer. \n\n“Let’s discuss how the two of you became friends.” My friend looked at me with a longing expression. \n\n“Fine, it all started when I was about 8? Maybe 9, I can’t really remember that far back. My dog had just died and my family didn’t seem to care that I was upset, I mean it’s not their fault they had work to do but it still left me feeling pretty lonely. We met by the river, I’d gone there to clear my head and he just sort of appeared out of my peripherals. He asked me what was wrong and sat there with me. Talked to me for hours and made me feel a whole lot better.” I shifted around in my seat, trying to get more comfortable. \n\n“So you could say that he was there for you when no-one else was?” The the#BADWORDS# said with an emotionless tone. \n\n“Yes, that’s how it started and then he was there for me every single time I felt really upset. The day I left home, the day I found out my mum had passed away, the day my girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me, all the hard times in my life he was there for me.”\n\n“So then, why have the two of you lost that connection, what caused the hostility?” The the#BADWORDS# was now leaning back into his chair. \n\n“The time I needed him most, he wasn’t there.” I said beginning to get upset. \n\n“And why did you need him this time more than the others?”\n\n“Everything in my life went wrong, I mean everything. I found out my wife has been sleeping with her boss, for almost 2 years. She kicked me out of the house, took my dog, took everything. I slept rough for a week because my father just didn’t have room to house me. My friends all turned their backs on me, they believed my wife’s lies, and they blamed me for my own stupid actions. So I went back to the river where I first met Death, sat by the water’s edge, just waiting my friend to be there for me, but he never showed. The last thing I remember is black and then I woke up here.” I was in tears now, unable to control my emotions any longer. \n\n“Why weren’t you there for me? Why did you leave me alone when I needed you most?” I managed to choke my words through my tears. My friend turned to me, with tears in his eyes. \n\n“It was your time.” \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1417923877","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmnhsl9","link_id":"t3_2oifv9","name":"t1_cmnhsl9","parent_id":"t3_2oifv9","retrieved_on":1425564539,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

When she didn't come home we contacted everyone to see if she was with them, Ricky was home with his mother.  She has leukemia, and had been getting worse.  He was with her all day, night, missed some school to take care of her.\n\nWhen we didn't follow the demands of the first ransom call we got a lock of her hair.  We thought it could have been anyone's, anyone of her friends could have cut a lock.  It was just hair anyway.  The next call we ignored we got a finger.  My babies finger...in a manila envelop.  I remember crying until I passed out.  It had her favorite shade of polish on it.  She bit her nails so the polish was chipped and bare in spots.  We knew without a doubt it was Chelsea's. \n\nThe next call we followed their instructions to the letter.  I put all of my jewelry into the envelop they sent my daughter's finger in.  We never thought to have it dusted for prints, we were frantic.  Please don't judge us for the mistakes we made — which were many.\n\nAfter the next request didn't get us our daughter back we finally broke down and contacted the police, disregarding the kidnapper(s)' request for no authorities.  The first time they called after the police got involved one of the new officers made a mistake.  For that mistake the kidnapper(s) sent us photos of them raping our daughter.  Chelsea was bleeding from...the...abuse.\n\nThe FBI was immediately brought in after that and took over the \"operation.\"  My daughter was a scenario to them...nothing more.  They always asked me how I was doing, they offered to bring in a the#BADWORDS#, it drove me mad.  They didn't make mistakes, though.  The next call went without incident as I stumbled through the written speech they had prepared.\n\nThis time, they let her speak, \"Mom? Mom, please get me out of here! Mom I'm —\" I could tell they didn't put the phone close to her and I had to make out her words over his creepy breathing.  His breathing was terrifying and sinister and made me hate him more.  I couldn't imagine the agony and terror my daughter experienced.\n\nOur neighbors alienated us, mostly because they didn't know how to behave around us.  I suppose, part of it could have been that to the FBI everyone was a suspect.  When people came near they were interrogated.  The school allowed them to check her locker, interview the staff, and students.  \n\nEveryone was apologetic in the beginning, they pitied us.  Now, they are trying to tell me to move on.  Like it has been long enough and I need to get on with my life.  THEY CAN ALL #BADWORDS# OFF!!!! \n\nThe FBI got a lead, an anonymous tip said she was in some motel room.  She was with an older man.  They said they could hear them through the walls talking and laughing.  When the Feds raided the motel they found the older man, my husband.  He had hanged himself.  \n\nThey inspected the room and found no evidence of anyone else.  Maybe he just didn't have the courage to struggle through this any longer.  This is why I need YOU.  I have given everything I had to the kidnapper(s), burying my husband, investigators, psychics.  I have nothing left...\n\nYou are my last hope,\n\nAlone in the world.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdited: Typo","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418199388","downs":0,"edited":"1418200081","gilded":0,"id":"cmqmltd","link_id":"t3_2osity","name":"t1_cmqmltd","parent_id":"t3_2osity","retrieved_on":1425509805,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"bland12","body":"CONTINUED!!!!!\n\n……..\n\nHe turned back for one last glimpse of that sickening orange glow that used to be London, as he did he thought of the speech from the Under Secretary of State, George Henry Hall, which had been delivered shortly after the destruction of London. “We will never give up, never surrender, England shall be a free bastion of hope…” \n\nAs he trudged slowly down the hill he scoffed at that sentence, “always be free huh” he thought as he stared at one of the giant walls the Germans had constructed to divide the country after they had swept across it within three weeks after London’s destruction. He again thought of that speech by Hall, “Our indomitable spirit will see us through, we will fight, we will fight through all eternity if we must, but victory will be ours. We will not stop, we will not be turned away from our cause! Revenge for London, and victory for England!”\n\nAgain he couldn’t help but scoff at that statement, it was popular with all the freedom fighters, they quoted it before every attack, at every meeting. Every freedom fighter had to know it. He knew it well, but it seemed idiotic to quote a man who within three weeks had signed the unilateral surrender of British forces. Yet 75 years later he was remembered as a hero. “Time changes everything” he whispered under his breath before he knocked on the door. \n\nThe door opened a crack, and a familiar voice blurted out, much too loudly, “JAMES! FINALLY, what took you so bloody long!” It was more of a statement than a question. “Shut up Charles, do you want the SS swarming all over us or something, and you say us Americans are loud… bloody hell.”\n\n……\n\nJames had picked up a few customs from the Brits since he managed to infiltrate the country with a few other American special ops guys five years ago. He still didn’t take too kindly to the Brits either. How could he, the Brits lost one city and just laid over for the Germans. On the other hand the Americans lost New York, D.C., Miami, Boston, and still beat back the Germans. \n\nOnce the U.K. fell the Germans turned their attention west to America, and while the Americans had played coy about entering a conflict that didn’t belong to them, they made no mistake about realizing what could happen if the Germans set their sights upon them. So F.D.R. had ordered the construction of what would be the largest naval fleet to ever sail the Earth. \n\nIt was proved to be prophetic, the Germans did manage to land in the New England area, and then smuggle their atomic weapons down the coast line to be detonated in targeted cities. American intelligence stopped five such weapons, capturing them intact, but still millions died and the capital was laid to waste, but with the fleets still intact the planned german ground invasion failed, and thus the War that had started in 1944 turned into a stale mate, one that gave the Americans enough time to reverse engineer the atomic weapons of the Germans to their own use. \n\nIn 1953, with the help of the defected genius Albert Einstein, the Americans were ready to counter strike. Lightweight, easily mobile “suitcase” atomic bombs were dispatched to American spies throughout Europe. In all 20 weapons were sent, and eight reached their targets. Bern, Warsaw, Moscow, Stuttgart, Hamm, Hamburg, Munich, and Frankfurt.\n\n…\n\nBy 1954 a cease fire was put in place between the two nations. America thought it had dealt a near death blow to Schuyler and his War machine. When in reality all they had done was set back Schuylers plans of establishing the perfect race. Schuyler had achieved his goal of European domination, the war with the Americans was simply a distraction to achieve his ultimate goal. Genetic perfection, and the subsequent cleansing of those not worthy.\n\nIn 1936 Schuyler had begun to import hundreds of thousands of workers from The Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Each year hundreds of thousands, possibly millions more. Each year more were brought in, even some of Schuylers closest advisors were later recorded as not understanding how they could keep bringing in so many laborers year in and year out.\n\nThe truth was much more sinister, Schuyler needed genetic material to experiment with. The strongest, the smartest, the tallest, the fastest. They were kept a live longer than the rest. However their existence was far worse than death. \nThe estimations are wide ranging and perhaps only two people will ever know the full extent of the deaths arraigned by Schuyler’s genetic genocide campaign. Those two people being Schuyler himself, and his closest advisor – Adolf Hitler. However all the experts agree that Schuyler has massacred at a minimum 150 million people; Jews, Arabs, gypsies, Cossacks, Russians, Asians, Africans, and even a large number of Europeans were all among those massacred. Some even believed the number could be as high as 600 million, but with no official records, and the German state still in control of the entirety of Europe there is no way to know what the true total is.\n\n……..\n\n“James, it’s time… we are finally ready!” Charles was nearly squealing with excitement. \n“Charles, calm down. What do you mean we are ready?” James calmly replied.\n“James how am I supposed to calm down! It’s DONE! DONE DONE DONE! Finished! Let me say this in terms even an American can understand.” Charles then went into a slow, almost southern drawl, “that dar machine we’s been builden is dun!”\n\nJames was offended, but was too stunned to actually respond. He had to compartmentalize what he just heard, how could it be done? He didn’t honestly believe it was even possible! \n“It worked?” James was nearly stuttering.\n“OF COURSE IT WORKED! Einstein said it would, and it does!” Charles was still shouting.\n“Okay then…. So….. What do we…. What do we do now?” James was stammering now.\n“Well… you go back, you kill Schuyler and then stay to make sure that his party never rises to power” Charles was suddenly very stern.\n“Okay then Charles, I know you know the answer! You’ve worship Einstein and his theoretical models for years now. If I kill Schuyler who takes his place?” James asked.\n“Well… all the models and theories show that Adolf Hitler would come to power instead.” Charles was totally composed now, and sounded more like a college professor giving a lecture.\nJames was floored, “YOU MEAN TO TELL ME, THAT I HAVE TO KILL THE WORST MAN IN HISTORY ONLY TO HAVE THE SECOND WORST MAN TAKE OVER FOR HIM!?”\n“Look around you James… it can’t be worse than this” Charles was all business now. “It has to be done James, and you know it too.\nJames took in a deep breath and then as said as if it were a sigh, “fine, set it up. I want to be ready to go back within the hour.”\n\nWith that, everyone in the room scurried off to handle their part of process to ready the machine for the jump back in time. This left James sitting in the middle of a small room that suddenly felt very large. His mind was racing through so many things, imagines of his family, friends, and his girlfriend. Would he ever see them again? Would they even exist in a future time where Schuyler had never risen to power? What did the future hold for this new time line that would be created? \n\nHe remembered Charles’ words, “it can’t be worse than this”. With that he got up and started readying himself for the upcoming jump.\n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418235466","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmqyzfm","link_id":"t3_2otswo","name":"t1_cmqyzfm","parent_id":"t1_cmqilci","retrieved_on":1425501477,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":false,"author":"porqtanserio","body":"*Tick, Tick, Tick.* Sighing, I flipped the sheets over, and turned to my left, uncovered. I could hear the soft, deep, breathes coming from the lump of mousy brown hair laying on the pillow next to me. Man, do I love to watch her sleep, it’s almost as if it radiates its own type of tranquility.  She smells funny again. *Tick, Tick, Tick.* That triggered the reminders, slowly creeping under my skin, like an IV dripping the same debilitating thoughts that have been haunting me for the past two weeks. *You know she’s cheating.* I swear that clock will sync with any thought in my mind. The signs are there, the secret “meetings”, the late-nights at work, the over doused perfume and the smell of alcohol on her breath secreted under the false pretenses of a girls night and a bad bout of hiccups. *You know where they are meeting tomorrow.* \n\nGod I wish I could shut my brain off. She does smell funny again, a mixture of itchy grass and fresh linens. I can’t place it. I’m going to follow her tomorrow, allowing the paranoia to continue to set in. Adjusting to the new insomnia, I stared off into the wall, deep in thought, until finally drifting off to sleep three hours later. \n\nThe next morning I resumed life as usual, I kissed her good-bye as she left for work, emailed my boss about my bout of food poisoning, and then put out enough food for the cat to last three days. But as I got closer and closer to the front door, the fear started dripping back into my veins. *Am I crazy for following her?* I should trust her, she’s been my girlfriend for years, maybe I am the one being paranoid.  My heart felt like it was going to fall out of my chest and my fingers started going numb as I removed the crumpled piece of paper I stole from the inside of her jacket pocket. It could be the first clue in solving the puzzle. I set downstairs for my car, address in hand. \n\nIt was a park. A national park. I parked the car, this is not what I imagined. I had thoughts of finding her car, in front of a strange house or secretly attending bars, not this. How the fu-“Can I help you sir?” I snapped out of my disbelief and annoyance, the park ranger was staring, half asleep, into my driver’s side window. “No sir sorry, thanks” I mumbled under my breathe and began to shut the car off. Guess it would be a nice day for a walk.  \n\nI walked a few meters up the rocky path, until I decided that this was stupid. It was hot, and I was sweating. I felt dumb. Turning around, I noticed the mousy brown hair, with her face turned away from me, kneeling within the woods. I peered into the moss-covered trees off the path, where she was. A guy approached from within the woods, *Oh #BADWORDS#, this is it.* I had caught her. A million thoughts started running through my head but all I could do was crouch to try and disguise my heavy wheezing and intent to eavesdrop on their hushed chatter. I wanted to faint.\n\nI blinked twice. Again. She was-transforming-no, changing. No- I’m on acid, this cannot be happening. She started disappearing. I could hear the trees whistling and the vines snapping on the ground. The vines started twirling around her ankle and up her legs, turning her green along the way. I clutched my mouth, stifling the screams. If I didn’t feel the need to vomit, I would say it was the most divine being, or woman, or creature, I had ever seen. She even glittered in the sun as the leaves overtook what used to be her hands. Pausing, she turned to face me knowing I was there. Her green eyes pierced into my cornea. I started to feel a sort of misplaced serenity overcome me, she was reading my mind. *I’m sorry I didn’t trust you*, was all I could telepathically send back.\n\nShe nodded. And ran off. I went home and sat on the bed, deciding what to prepare us for dinner. *Tick, Tick, Tick*. I have to get rid of that damn clock. \n\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418248793","downs":0,"edited":"1418251173","gilded":0,"id":"cmr6vzl","link_id":"t3_2ougo4","name":"t1_cmr6vzl","parent_id":"t3_2ougo4","retrieved_on":1425497421,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

Here he was, in a midnight blue suit, sitting in my living room, smiling as he poured some Jack and lit a cigar. If anything, he looked more like Stan Lee than a cherub. But why the blue suit?\n\n\"Everybody wants to know that.\" he laughed, as he leaned back in his seat, puffing on his cigar. \"Why am I here, why now? You know why, Chuck.\"\n\nSuaveness personified.\n\n\"Listen, Chuck. I didn't get to choose my tastes anymore than you did. I don't like to stay the same for everybody, but you're a straight s#BADWORDS# and I figured it'd be best to skip the #BADWORDS#.\" He grinned over his glass, raising an eyebrow inquisitively. \n\n\"My name's not Chuck... and what are you doing here, anyway?\" I asked, tapping my pen on the divorce papers I'd been reading through before I noticed him sitting there. I knew who it was before he'd even said anything. \"You only come to people who need answers. I've already figured out what I need to do.\"\n\n\"Ah, yeah? What's that, Chuck? Deliver those papers and turn your gas on? Take a little nap? C'mon, do you really think I'm that dumb?\" Cupid was an annoying bas#BADWORDS#. Always asking questions that you knew the answer too. He asked too many questions. He made *me* ask too many questions.\n\nI opened my mouth to reply, but I couldn't put it into words. I *felt* it, but I couldn't say it. He smiled as he puffed his cigar and slowly wagged his foot, like a pendulum swinging back and forth.\n\n\"Look Chuck, I do my best to let you guys figure this stuff out on your own, but sometimes people need a little help. I know you feel like this is it, I know you feel like this is the end of the road. Think about it for a second, what happens tomorrow?\"\n\nI couldn't believe he was asking that. Every heartbreak I'd ever felt was because of this #BADWORDS#. It was all his fault.\n\n\"What happens tomorrow? You already know that, don't you? You set me up with somebody I really mesh with and you pull the rug from under my feet. That's what happens, #BADWORDS#.\"\n\nCupid laughed, a little puff of smoke escaping with each chuckle. He inhaled deeply, and stared at the ceiling for a few seconds before saying anything.\n\n\"Listen Chuck, I knew how it was all gonna end, sure. I got the ball rollin', sure. But that don't mean it wasn't real. You felt it. Those ladies felt it. I just made sure the bat hit the ball.\" He said, pantomiming a big swing.\n\nThat was the thing with these sub-gods, they were eccentric bas#BADWORDS#s, and they never spoke straight. Personally, I didn't feel like talking much.\n\nCupid leaned forward in his lazyboy, looking at me. He already knew what I wanted to ask. \n\n\"Why do you keep failing, Chuck? Why do you mess everything up? Why doesn't a kid know how to ride a bike the first time?\" \n\nI knew he wasn't going to directly answer anything. Cupid was famous for making you figure it out on your own... mostly. \n\n\"You didn't really expect everything to be grand at your first ballgame, did you? You didn't think you'd last eight seconds in your first rodeo, huh?\" Cupid smiled, taking a sup of his Jack satisfactorily. \n\nBas#BADWORDS# came here to help and he only confused me more. My phone lit up, reminding me I had an unread message. It was Racheal, an old friend. 'Are you ok? I know you've been down, but I'm on my way over with Chinese. I'll be there in a few.'\n\nI smiled, slightly. Racheal had been here for me through everything. She was the only one that didn't mind all the baggage. All the issues, the #BADWORDS#.

{"archived":false,"author":"based-dog","body":"The Red Death, they called it. Like that Edgar Allan Poe story. Scientists initially categorised it as a sub-type of the Bubonic Plague, but further research showed that it was completely distinct. In fact, nothing like it had ever been seen on Earth.\n\nThat drove the conspiracy theorists crazy. Some said it was an alien bacterium, sent from the stars to wipe us out and leave the planet ripe for the taking. Others said it was sent from god to punish us for our sinful ways, and that it would signal the end of days. The more rational among the madmen said it was a top-secret military experiment gone wrong, unleashed by mistake (or perhaps not) on an unsuspecting world. Some even said it was built by a civilisation that ceased to exist before time even began. There were a lot of crazy theories going around when it hit.\n\nBut one thing was certain - humanity was in peril.\n\nThe Red Death spread like wildfire, wiping out nearly a third of the world's population by 2018. Humanity was desperate. Wars broke out in the Middle East and Africa, decimating society and driving what was left of those places into the arms of the world. Soon, America, Europe and Australia were flooded with refugees seeking an escape from the horrors, who would only find that things weren't necessarily any better there. \n\nThe Red Death struck everyone, ra#BADWORDS#ing the earth and leaving behind a trail of sorrow and extinction. The sings were easy to spot - red sores on the body, followed by lesions that bled the victim dry. But what really killed them off was the phenomenon that came to be called The Ring - a gaping hole that formed in the afflicted person's chest, carved out by flesh liquifying into blood. They started to call it the Heartless Plague because of that.\n\nBut, like we have before, we killed it off. By 2025, with half our population gone and the world in shambles, the Red Death was almost gone. Sure, Africa and the Middle East were desolate, empty wastelands, but the rest of the world was free. As the months went by, humanity started filling in the gaps. The survivors, drunk on relief and celebrating the end of humanity's greatest threat, began things anew, bringing new life into the world and giving birth to the new generation.\n\nBut things were not as they seemed.\n\nYou see, the Red Death had infected everyone - everyone in the whole world. It just didn't manifest in everyone. It had lain dormant within the populace, laying in wait and changing us all. It transpired that the Red Death could alter our DNA.\n\nWe had given birth to new lifeforms, transcending humanity.\n\nThey were known as Espers, the children of the plague. The name Esper came from the thing that made them stand out from the rest of humanity - their access to ESP, or extra-sensory perception as it's otherwise known. The Espers had been mutated by the hereditary Red Death cells inherited from their parents, allowing them to perform feats regular humans were incapable of - everything from telepathy, mind control, telekinesis, levitation, precognition and, in extreme cases, manipulation of time and space. The abilities stemmed from a strange phenomenon found within the bodies of the Espers, a crimson mass of strange, alien tissue around their hearts called The Bleed, which seemed to distribute their psionic capabilities through their bodies.\n\nWe thought we'd escaped the brink of death, but once again we had been pushed back to it.\n\nWe kept tabs on them. We watched them. We even threw them in camps and experimented on them. But, as it always has, our fear and cruelty only made us weaker. The Espers attacked, and we were on the precipice of defeat. But luckily, Red River came along just in time.\n\nFormed by men too cold and malevolent for the likes of Halliburton or Blackwater, Red River used all their wealth and lack of conscience to build weapons that would be able to fight these super-powered threats. Soon, the tides turned and we were back on top. By the end, we'd slaughtered almost every one of those Espers, and the ones we didn't, we locked away for a long time.\n\nNow, it's 2040 and I'm writing this. The world is at peace. Our economies are stable, our society is much fairer and we live safe, rewarding lives. But the shadow of Red River cast itself wide over us all. Was this really worth so many lives? What of the Espers born every day, who must simply wait until their differences manifest and they can be escorted away by men in suits and never see the world outside again?\n\nWe have order, but at what cost?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418436821","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmteiln","link_id":"t3_2p1ary","name":"t1_cmteiln","parent_id":"t3_2p1ary","retrieved_on":1425459527,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

I've been staring at the tiny cellphone screen for far too long.  Time to let them roam.  \n\nThey scream in joy as I let them roll,  my tear ducts unleashing a torrent of refreshing liquid. For the first time in hours,  they attempt to focus on something,  anything more than a few inches away. \n\nThe computer first.  It's perched atop the false oak desk, the plastic sheet it rests upon slightly melted from the laptop's heated exhaust spurting out nonstop for at least two years, as long as the aging building has been in use as Battalion Headquarters. The faded green sticker emblazoned with the words FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY matched the green, flickering desktop background, proudly proclaiming UNCLASSIFIED, as if such a label meant it was in some way special among the others in the building. Perhaps it was. It's not as though I could leave this room to see if the other government-special computers bore a different tag.\n\nBeside it, the muted, fading yellow of the old touch-tone telephone complemented the aging architecture. Like the beige linoleum floor and whitewashed cinderblock walls, it cried out in builderesque complacency. \"I might have been condemned once, but Army can't pay for all you young whippersnappers to have fancy glass offices.\" As if this were my office. It's practically a prison. \n\nThe overstuffed clipboard, the desk's last inhabitant, speaks more derisively. It serves as a reminder that you worked your 8 hour day yes#BADWORDS#ay. And then it goes to dutifully log your 24 hours of subsequent duty in a tiny eight by twenty room in a folding metal chair behind that big false oak desk. The single, harsh, fluorescent light harshly reflects off the clip, blinding you no matter which direction you look. The reflective coating over the double glass doors at the other end of the room once protected you from the prying eyes of the outside world during the day, but night fell eight hours ago, and since then it has reflected only that damned fluorescent light and your own tortured fact back at you. I sc#BADWORDS# the metal chair up against the cinder block wall in a subconscious effort to distance myself a little further from the reality.\n\nBut there must be an escape. The darkened hallway to the right may as well be another wall. No windows. My phone, though. It has 4G. The Internet  stands ready, waiting to welcome me back to its embrace. But the wall is full of Sergeants Major. The opposing wall full of Commanders. All are staring. One, two eyes on me. Doubled again in the reflection  in the mirrored glass doors. I am a professional, they cry, and God willing, you will be too!\n\nBut it is 3AM, and I've six more hours to go. I am sorry, my darling eyes. I must sacrifice you to stave off the boredom. I will not dishonor my leaders. I will not fall asleep on duty. Internet, take me away for a little longer!\n\nAnd the Commanders stare down.\n\nAnd the Sergeants Major stare down.\n\nTheir eyes on my shoulders; that weight compounding the sheer force of the sterile white walls and souless government beige linoleum.\n\nSix more hours.\n\nSix more hours.\n\nSix more hours.\n\nTL;DR\n I'm stuck on a Staff Duty shift in this room for so long I'm not sure if I'm awake or just dreaming that I am.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418462253","downs":0,"edited":"1418462583","gilded":0,"id":"cmtmih7","link_id":"t3_2p5nx6","name":"t1_cmtmih7","parent_id":"t3_2p5nx6","retrieved_on":1425455725,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":false,"author":"MisterBorgia","body":"I'm new to reddit, so go easy on my pigeon like physique. I had this dwelling in my place for awhile, and I think it relates. \n\n\n**An Adventure**\n\n\nThis Summer I went on a small adventure. I needed one. It came spontaneously, but the prospect of discovery was always in the back of my mind. I saw no limitations in the connection between us humans, and nature. It was always as it once was, yet we seem more lost nowadays because of our artificial relationship with inert materials. White, polished, Orwellian looking pish. I don’t denounce technology, I think it’s great. However, I think we should establish some self-respected rules as to when scrolling and swiping is enough and it’s time to step outside and smell the roses. So I did exactly that.\n\n\nThe sky was bright when I arose. I filled my ancient FAI camp bag with a bottle of crumby water and 4 butter croissants shrouded in a plastic bag. My family had rented a house in Kerry for two weeks, to, as quoted, ‘get away from the flatness’ that was my home place of Clare. The area we were staying in, Castlegregory, is a particularly beautiful spot. A small village ripe with activity hidden under the shadow of Benokee; a gentle, keep-it-simple mountain formed in the pre-Cambrian period. Castlegregory is a place full of dark and volatile history, which is ironic considering the amount of artists there who exude the quiet and meditative. It’s a bit like a place where all of Ireland should be like. Scant of neo-cafes, Catholic domination, and all the #BADWORDS# in between. What it had was everything I wanted. Beaches, landscape, the possibility of romance with a beautiful lady, music, mad people and most of all, freedom.\n\n\nSo I set off. Alright, I didn’t quite gallop into the haze like Indiana Jones with raging hormones; I got a lift to Glenteenassig, a hidden valley at the Southern side of Benokee. (Castle is to the north.) Glenteenassig has two lakes. Upper and lower. Where I was going was lower. Dropped at the path entrance, I followed it all the way to the river crossing, where I found a staff, with a head on it shaped like a goats foot. I took it as a sign. I was going to climb a mountain, so I could only ponder on the ergonomics of a staff made for being pushed into the rugged landscape. It was early, and the sun was strong in the sky. People were scarcer in the lower lake. The upper lake was more popular with the Kodak clickers. These people, to me, were the hordes of Sauron. I detach myself from anyone who safely remains behind a screen. The mountain wants you to climb it. Let it seduce you, and climb.\n\n\nI cir#BADWORDS#vented the shimmering lower lake like a mad tribal war leader, leading his charge to the choke before the enemy briskly arrives. There was a man and child there, and the child said to the man: ‘Where’s he goin’ Dad?’ to which the Father replied; ‘he’s goin’ mad son.’ As I ran around the lake; blue, miniscule dragonflies ascended in nervous bunches from the giant ferns I made my path through. The lower lake is surrounded by ridges on the north, south and west sides, while the east remains open to land that recedes further back towards the entrance path. I came from the lowest ridge of the north, and was travelling around the right side of the lake facing south. The western ridge is the highest, but is easily manageable in the lower part of the slope. Here the vegetation is more prominent, and as the slope ascends, the vegetation gives way to silver rock.\n\n\nThe halfway point between the north and south landmasses lies a long, beautiful stone wall that goes up to the crowning, ridges at the top. As I crossed it, I couldn’t help but imagine it as some sort of ancient toll gate. A structure so needlessly outlandish; to the untrained eye of course. My best guess was this was a strip to establish a means of defence against something… Years of school history told me a rival faction, but I wanted to believe it warded against giants who roamed dangerously in the ancient world.\n\n\nOn the Southern slope there lies an eternally shimmering waterfall. It was here that I was to ascend, and get up around the western crown ridges. Climbing high enough, I filled my water bottle with some of the real stuff, and took a big gulp. Putting my face to the reflection of that generous torrent felt like feeling water for the first time. Like a liquid that had just formed in our atmosphere out of the first spring, and I was the lucky individual who got to taste it’s infinite embrace first. As I ascended, the view got even more spectacular. On the north end of Benokee, Castlegregory is built at the start of a giant sandspit that pushes outward into the Atlantic. The quaint glinting houses of The Maharees, at the most northern point of the spit, came to my vision; and, as I got further up, became surprisingly more prominent. The northern point of The Maharees is about 12km from where I was standing at that moment on the tip of the southern ridge. My pace increased as I could not wait to get to the top of the high ridges to the right of me.\n\n\nIt was no easy task. The stretch of highland I wanted to frolic about on was formed on top of a steep, upward jutting slice of rock. I was leaning ever so slightly backwards as I climbed it. Gravity showed no mercy. The memory of rainfall trapped in the mind of the ridge seemed to remember and decidedly dropped a lot of it on my pathetic, human head. I came close to slipping at some points, but held steadfast, my trusty bag of croissants and Goat’s Foot Staff forever at my side. After the humidity became unbearable, I finally got where I wanted to be. Splayed in front of the view of all views, with front row seats.\n\n\nBut, nature does not compromise. As if by some sorcerous intervention, a vast cloud rushed towards me, completely obstructing my view. I could not see a thing. The heat was shut out and moisture hung in heavy tufts all around me. I sat on a rock and tore into my soggy croissants.\n\n\nAnd thus it was. I feel that magic is not an unreachable thing for human beings. It is everywhere; but cannot exist independently. We must create it, and, as a lone teenager submerged in the grasp of a cloud, experience it. There is nothing wrong with escaping into our own minds, where we classify things based on our own emotional and spiritual expositions. Go have an adventure somewhere, alone.\n\n\nFinishing my croissants and water I descended the slope, back into civilisation. There I resumed my normal habits jovially, and still do, but I’ll never let the mountains leave my head.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418580081","downs":0,"edited":"1418580501","gilded":0,"id":"cmuntku","link_id":"t3_2p9xwz","name":"t1_cmuntku","parent_id":"t3_2p9xwz","retrieved_on":1425438040,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

As Aberforth opened his mouth to console her, he noticed his worried brother at the door. He shook his head, indicating that Albus should stay out. He had a tendency to make these kinds of situations worse, especially with Ariana. Albus gave him a slight nod and retreated.\n\n\"I was thinking of socks,\" Ariana blurted out. \"Mum used to knit socks - maybe I could do it too?\" \n\n\"Everyone needs socks,\" Aberforth replied encouragingly. \"Did Mum show you how?\" \n\nAs Ariana thought back to her mother, tears filled her eyes, but she swallowed hard and suppressed them. \n\n\"I think I could do it,\" Ariana said. \n\n\"Well then, I'll get you everything you need,\" Aberforth told her. \"And I'll expect some grand socks this December.\"\n\n\"Albus too,\" Ariana pointed out. \n\n\"Albus too,\" Aberforth agreed. \n\nAlbus, who was still outside the room, smiled. After the guardianship of his siblings was #BADWORDS# upon him, he had been worried. He didn't know how to calm Ariana down nor how to get through to his sullen younger brother. But when the two were together, Ariana was calm and Aberforth was cheerful. As long as Aberforth and Ariana had each other, they were all going to be okay. \n\nSuddenly, Albus heard the chairs moving across the wooden floor. He quickly ducked out of sight - he didn't want them to think he had intruded on their moment together. \n\n*Eight months later* \n\nIt had been weeks since the duel, but it was the first time that Albus had been able to go into her room. Aberforth was long gone - where to, Albus didn't know, but he couldn't stop him. Now, all Albus had was this empty house and memories of his family.\n\nAs he walked through the room, he suddenly heard a crack. He lifted his foot to find a now broken knitting needle on the floor. Albus picked it up and thought back to the conversation he had overheard. Aberforth had bought her wool and needles, and she had been so excited that she had immediately dumped a drawer's worth of her belongings onto the floor and declared it her knitting drawer instead.\n\nAlbus walked over to said drawer, intending to leave the broken needle inside. He didn't have the heart to just throw it away nor the will to repair it. Once he opened the drawer, however, he found himself unable to move. \n\nThe beginnings of two pairs of wool socks were nestled inside, untouched since Ariana had last kept them there. Albus took the soft wool into his hands and, for the first time since they had buried Ariana, began to cry.

{"archived":false,"author":"Jass1995","body":"It created a big fuss that morning. A print on the outside of the dome. But this was *human*like. A large crowd of what remained of the human race could not help staring at it. I mean, it's not like television existed anymore. So this was as close to new entertainment people were going to get aside from reading books which, surprisingly, still had not yet become a pastime for residents of this glass dome.\n\nI took a look at it, and walked away, uninterested. Why, you ask? Quite simple really. It was mine.\n\nSee, about a decade ago, I was tasked with helping put together this dome. And I was one of the workers tasked with helping to place it down. Of course, what with exo-suits and all, they really needed like, one man for each point of the compass. So I was tasked with guarding the southern side.\n\nThe thing is, the job meant we would be sealing *our* fate. We would be doomed to die on the outside. but, I'm not the type of person who takes a liking to that kind of thing, if you catch my drift. When I was certain it would fall in place, I gave the all clear to let it down. As it was descending, I ran like hell was snapping at my heels and, with the help of the suit of course, slipped under the dome, into what now is the remains of civilisation.\n\nI kept my head down and out of sight of the residents and the workers outside, because we agreed we would go our separate ways to die in whatever miserable way life could give us. When they left, I ditched the suit and took place in one of the empty houses, built in advance for the future generation.\n\nSo why is it that this news didn't surprise me? Well, for starters, we were to wipe the dome to remove any indicator of a predecessor. Give the next generation the illusion that life was in the dome and all that was there was to it. Of course, when your saving your own ass, procedure doesn't really come to mind does it? And it just so happened that the wind blew in the direction of my print that day.\n\nAh well. I'll keep it to myself. Soon enough things will settle down.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFeedback, as always, appreciated :)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418730297","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmwgqrh","link_id":"t3_2pfo18","name":"t1_cmwgqrh","parent_id":"t3_2pfo18","retrieved_on":1425374127,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}

{"archived":false,"author":"Zhira_The_Thief","body":"I was here when humanity was but a newborn, shrieking and writhing within its new skin.  I was here when the first great empires rose from the dirt, its denizens believing themselves to be the epitome of human evolution.  I was here for every murder, every war, and every plague since then.  I was here when humanity died, as well.\n\n\nLike I anticipated, the last sound heard by human ears was the collective shriek of humanity; The piercing wail of an air raid siren.  They destroyed themselves through war.  As humankind advanced, so did their methods of killing each other.  Humans finally reached the peak of their violent ambition with the introduction of nuclear weapons.  The ability to destroy massive amounts of life with one decision is what ultimately ended them.  Their death was awful.  The air was charged with electricity and smelled of burnt flesh as the volley of bombs descended endlessly across the earth, ending all human advancement with a flash of heat.\n\n\nAlthough they're all gone I remain here, in the charred ruins of what used to be a lush and diverse land.  Humanity died a selfish death; they didn't die alone, they dragged the collective kicking and screaming masses of all organic life with them.  I rarely see animals anymore and plants are all but nonexistant.  I ocasionally see a rat or a #BADWORDS#roach scuttling in the rubble of once great, towering landscapes.  I would give anything to see a deer or a flower.  I miss the vivid colors and life of the former world.  Now the earth is covered in a shroud of darkness and decay.\n\n\nThroughout the centuries I have wandered Earth, condemned to be alone and without the sweet grace of death.  I entertained myself by observing the humans around me.  I watched their progress from afar, bearing witness to many historical events.  I've witnessed atrocities greater than I imagined possible and yet the ones who carried out these injustices were allowed to pass on.  Hitler put a bullet through his skull, Stalin died of a cerebral hemorrhage, Saddam Hussein had a brutal death but at least he wasnt forced to eternally wander the land in solitude.  Mao Ze#BADWORDS#, Atilla the Hun, Pol Pot, Mussolini, Kim Jong Sun... I could spend a decade listing cruel and evil humans.  All of these men were given the sweet relief of death.  So why must I *still* be cursed with undeath?  Surely I've paid for my crime?  Maybe there's someone left still alive out there, scavenging what they can from the decaying remnants of civilization.  Maybe God has a cruel sense of humor and wants me to commit the last murder, just as I committed the first.  If that's the case, then I won't play his game.  I won't kill another, not even to end my torment.\n\n\nI take one last look up at the statue of Jesus in the decrepit church, his skin blackened and rotting from radiation.  As my eyes fall on the wounds of Christ, his hands pierced by the nails that hang him from the cross, I instinctively brush my hand across the accursed mark on my right hand, the mark which was seared into my flesh by God himself.\n\n\nI leave the church behind, neither emboldened nor peaceful like the religious masses who used to frequent this place.  I return to my eternity of wandering, no longer having the motivation to beg God to end my misery.\n\n\nNote:  Im sorry if there are some spelling errors or the format is odd, I typed this on my phone.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418762424","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmwvwze","link_id":"t3_2pgs73","name":"t1_cmwvwze","parent_id":"t3_2pgs73","retrieved_on":1425366959,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":false,"author":"through_shadow","body":"Sofia loved the photos of the apartment on craigslist, but after two weeks of apartment hunting in NY, she has quickly learned not to trust the photos. Between the Photoshop and the realtors posting photos of blatantly different apartments, Sofia knew that what seemed too good to be true often was. Still though, this was the best prospect they had had in a while. She was getting desperate- Craig's lease was up in two weeks, and there was no way he could move in with Sofia and her two roommates- in their one bedroom apartment for the remaining month on the lease. It was hard enough getting ready in the mornings when he stayed after their date nights- she couldn't let it become permanent. \n\nWhen they walked into the beautiful one bedroom apartment, with hardwood floors and a fireplace (a fireplace!), she wanted to squeal with joy. It was perfect. It was in their price range, and had more than the space they wanted. But something was wrong. Craig was bouncing on his feet in excitement, visibly fighting himself from saying yes right then and there to the realtor. But Sofia was hesitant. The second she crossed the threshold a cold, foreboding washed over her. She shook it off, forced a smile at Craig and began to walk around. Everything seemed perfect- the beautiful baseboards were something she had dreamed of in looking at Better Homes &amp; Gardens Magazines. The bedroom closet was huge! Not walk-in huge, but for New York standards, certainly impressive- she could actually walk into it. But as soon as she opened the closet door her stomach clenched. The feeling she felt upon entering the apartment increased tenfold. Something was off. It was the wood floor, she knew it immediately. Sensed it maybe. She looked down, and even though the lighting was poor she knew something wasn't right about the coloring. It didn't match. \n\nWhen she pointed it out to Craig, he dismissed her- \"who cares? It's *in* the closet. The rest of the place is perfect!\" Sofia knew he was right of course, but something about that floor just didn't seem right. Something about the entire apartment just didn't feel right. When she asked the realtor what happened to the floor, he nonchalantly said that a stain that had to be removed- something about the wood being stained the wrong color on repair. It seemed plausible, logical even given the look of it- but Sofia couldn't help but feel that something was wrong. Noting her hesitation, the realtor quickly chimed up that at the current price, the apartment would certainly go quick!\n\nThen Craig pointed out the granite countertops. It really was a beautiful apartment. Sofia really had no reason not to sign- it was perfect. If she could ignore the cold dread forming inside her, she knew Craig had found an amazing apartment, one they couldn't walk away from because of some weird feeling that Sofia couldn't even explain. She slowly nodded her assent to Craig, and walked towards the counter where the realtor had already laid out the lease to sign. As she picked up the pen and began to initial, she couldn't help but think that something was wrong, that this really is too good to be true.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418773921","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmx2jiw","link_id":"t3_2pighx","name":"t1_cmx2jiw","parent_id":"t3_2pighx","retrieved_on":1425363798,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

Except for one.\n\nA slim, white figure missing his left hand remained in top notch posture, well, the best posture that you can muster while on your knees. I raise my Energy Rifle and approach the confident figure.\n\nI kneel down to his height and look into his eyes through my suit's visor.\n\n\"So what did they call you back home?\" My voice produces a more robotic sound through the Vocalizer. I didn't need an answer though.\n\nThose eyes.. bright, burning ambers. A long, sunken face.

{"archived":false,"author":"Mevsstories","body":"The door opens and I throw myself inside as if from a storm. I wipe my brow. My sweat is cooling and, almost instantly, I’m shaking. A climate for metal and data, not for the corporeal. My eyes sting as I survey the hallway. The room is, as it was, piled almost to the ceiling with various detritus and waste. A nonsense of biological waste, syringes, needles and bloodied rags are a familiar welcoming party by this stage. No point in cleaning up. I suppose he thought the same.\n\nMy music has slowed to a steady drone with faint harmonics rises and falling above. I feel relaxed, comfortable initially. It’s like a strange kind of home, this place. Or a tomb is perhaps more apt. Though nobody would keep their loved one’s tomb in such a disgusting state so perhaps I do think of it as his home. I recognise elements in the music I’m listening to, my very own particular biometric soundtrack. It’s a strange sensation. As I think of this tomb, him buried so far beneath the earth, I can feel myself getting upset. I can hear it too. A certain atonality and bassy resonance. The software is emphasizing the underlying major chords, levelling the dynamics and removing all syncopation. It’s trying to calm me down. I focus, trying to push the shuddering, rising feedback out of my aural sphere. The exercise, the meditation of trying to alter the music, rather than alter the emotions, feels like playing an instrument, the input is so disparate from the output it’s hard to believe the two actions are linked. But it only really works in situations where I’m not interacting with anyone. It’s pretty damn hard to play an instrument and hold a conversation at the same time. So I remove the earpieces. This will naturalise my mood but I’m not in a position to use them anymore.\n\nI head down the hallway into the central chamber. From the main chamber came a steady blue glow, lighting up the lining of refuse close to the end of the hallway.\n\nThe air gradually becomes sickly sweet as I approach the nest. The hum of electronics becomes louder and more pressing.\n\nI turn the corner and see that disgusting alter once more. A viscous anger rises from my stomach.\n\nHow could you let me see you like this?\n\nLike a metallic birds nest lies the Alter. Long ago, he laid his body down on this simple table in the centre of the room. Every square inch of his skin blossoms with meters of wire, tubing and sensory cables. The array of threads and spines rises up from his decaying frame like a forest, ac#BADWORDS#ulating on the high ceiling before drooping back down into various esotery in the chamber. Such is the quan#BADWORDS#y of cabling and wires that enter/leave his body his shape is splayed over the table, like something pried open for observation. It is as if he had been carrying a horrible pregnancy of steel, copper and fibre and had lain down in the chamber to painfully birth the alien material out of every pore and orifice.\n\nThe first time I saw this I couldn’t even entertain the thought that this was him. I ran outside and vomited. It’s a horrific sight, still.\n\nNext to him is a woman. She is seated in the same chair as she is every year. The woman is sat up straight, as if to attention. Once again, she is wearing clothes unlike anything I’ve seen in the city. Undoubtedly, she is from the Community, from the towers. The first time I came here I searched her thoroughly, fearful yet a little curious. I searched her pockets, examined her body. Nothing unusual.\n\nWell, they’re all human at least.\n\nShe is his voice and his body for this session. A Peripheral. I suppose some kind of deal was arranged long ago, my considerate and loving husband loaning out another woman’s vocal chords and facial muscles to disturb and torment his wife from afar. The woman’s spine appears to be rigged up to the canopy of equipment above. Her eyes are bleak and empty betraying the fact she is now a tool of some other being.\n\n“He’s coming”, the seated woman spoke.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418839967","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmxrb1a","link_id":"t3_2plf7v","name":"t1_cmxrb1a","parent_id":"t3_2plf7v","retrieved_on":1425351953,"score":28,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":28}

{"archived":false,"author":"Clonedrone","body":"It had been twenty five years since he'd last stepped in to the men's dressing room in back of the theater. As a faculty brat he'd spent his formative years roaming the halls of the old prep school, both with friends and by himself. It felt strange to be back for a class reunion after his father's death. The old man's office on the corner, once a hangout for those who didn't quite fit in to any other cliques, had now been reappropriated for storage. This dressing room had been John's sanctuary, a place where no one ventured outside of those few bustling hours before and after a performance. He'd brought girls back here on some occasions, but mostly it was a quiet spot to sit and read or to catch up on sleep using one of the ancient couches that smelled of dust and stage makeup. \n\nLittle had changed, really. There were still old, forgotten costumes hanging on the high racks and piles of props in the corner. FDR's wheelchair, the scarecrow's hat, Tevye's vest, and dozens of other vestiges from forgettable productions of the not so recent past. He stepped into the corridor between vanities and felt the familiar, eerie rush of an infinity of selves staring back at him. There was still that sense that if he moved quickly enough he would be able to see the back of his head straight on. For the fun of it he jumped...jumped again...then stopped. Something was different.\n\nThere was a *delay*. When he landed he saw the the fourth or fifth iteration of himself land too, only a little bit slower. And it kept on like that. On and on into the shrinking forever he saw a wave of figures falling back to the ground in swift succession. But there was something stranger still. Genetics had not completely favored the men in his family. He'd been blessed with a workable level of intelligence and a lean physique, but at forty three he was already mostly bald on top. The farther down the line he looked, though, the more hair he saw, until the most distant figure in sight landed with a full mane of long dirty blonde hair- the kind he'd had when he last stepped into the dressing room.\n\nHe climbed onto the small counter and reached for his reflection. Contact sent ripples into the ever. The surface was like water! His hand disappeared for a moment and came back unharmed. Again. And again. And again and again he pushed his hand through the reflective liquid only to draw it back out in disbelief. A deep, primordial fear ran through his skin and settled with a terrible buzz in his stomach. What the #BADWORDS# was happening? He ran out of the room as fast as he could and slammed the heavy door behind him. The sound echoed through the empty hallway as he slumped down to the floor, his back resting against the wall opposite the dressing room. He was finally going insane. Forty three is a bit old for schizophrenia to set in, he'd read, but not outside of recorded history by any means. \n\nHe sat there for a long time just thinking. At first, it seemed like he'd made up his mind to return to the banquet hall in search of a confidant. There would still be some people left. Some really drunk people, he thought to himself. And at that, the kind of people who probably wouldn't listen to him or follow him back here. All of his old friends had cut out early to get back to their families or to hit the bars. Those that remained were the kind for whom high school was something to reminisce at length about, and he certainly hadn't run in those circles. \n\nThen another thought crossed his mind. It started as a memory, really. He remembered how it felt to run his hands through a full head of hair. Then, he remembered sitting in FDR's wheelchair. He remembered ripping off that damn hat to scratch his head furiously between scenes in The Wizard of Oz. And finally, he remembered stomping around in front of a packed house, lights blaring in his eyes as he sung about what life might be like if he were a rich man. What life might be like...\n\nWith a strange sense of calm he opened the door and walked back to the dressing room, ready for whatever fate awaited him on the other side of that mirror.\n\nEdit: spelling","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418879192","downs":0,"edited":"1418879903","gilded":0,"id":"cmybvbb","link_id":"t3_2pm6tk","name":"t1_cmybvbb","parent_id":"t3_2pm6tk","retrieved_on":1425341858,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

You always loved that voice.  Ever since that time she gave you that flower when you were only three.\"  Samantha had to put the letter down to wipe the tears from her eyes before continuing to read the letter aloud.\n\n\"Everyone around you thinks that the cataclysm did not give you a power, but I know better.  The cataclysm gave you a very special power.  A power that can change the world if you can master it.  But you cannot do it on your own.

Samantha, if you trust the words of a stranger, the only stranger who can help your brother save the world, just open the front door and allow us to meet.  I will be there.\"  Samantha finished the letter and put it on the night stand with a trembling hand.  Jeremy was laying on his bed uncharacteristically still in the shadowy morning sun.\n\n\"Jeremy, do you trust him?  I mean, it's been three weeks since the cataclysm, why didn't he contact us sooner?  He didn't even sign the letter with his name just, 'The Guide.'\"  Jeremy's dark brown eyes briefly scanned his sister's face.  Intention, devotion, love, and earnest curiosity were meant to pass with that look.  I felt the moment pass, and Jeremy began playing with his hands.  Samantha stood up and left the room.  I could no longer see her through Jeremy, but I heard her footsteps coming down the stairs.  She must have gotten the message.  The plain old wooden door opened silently and I was face to face with Jeremy's sister.  She was still young but not a girl anymore.  Not after caring for her autistic brother for the last ten years.

She hesitated in the door for a moment then nodded and stepped aside so I could come in.  As I stepped in, I thought back on the last few weeks.  I remembered agonizing over the memories and sensory information that had flooded my mind after the cataclysm.  Then the sudden calm as I realized what I was seeing and what it could mean.  \"Perhaps,\" I thought at the time, \"these powers we were given weren't so useless after all.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418937189","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmyxqsk","link_id":"t3_2pp77g","name":"t1_cmyxqsk","parent_id":"t3_2pp77g","retrieved_on":1425330593,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"the_omega99","body":"Mike stepped off the cruiser. *On small step for Mike, one giant leap for Mike-kind,* he jokingly thought. It was the 300th anniversary of contact with the moonlings and his family had saved up all year to be able to see the Moon Parade.\n\nIt all started back in the 1600s, when Gallileo provided evidence that there existed sentient life on another world. This started a lightning fast space race that caused technology to grow at unseen speeds. Now, more than 300 years later, humanity was in a golden age. It had been more than a hundred years since the last war and quality of life was at an all-time high.\n\nWe had even established a rapid transit with the moon, which provided 30 minute transportation to the moon. Mike had learned in school that the rapid transit system reached nearly 0.25c and in fact the majority of the time was spent in a very difficult decelerating process. Starting was easy. Stopping was not. There was even a joint Earth-Moon research project that had shuttles capable of safely decelerating in a fraction of the time, cutting the trip down to a mere minute.\n\nLost in thought, Mike bumped into a moonling, stumbling onto the cobbled walkway of Yirugu, the capital of the Moon nation.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" the moonling said, quickly helping Mike to his feet.\n\n\"S-sorry, it's my fault, I wasn't paying attention.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! I am most sorry my actions caused you harm. I wish you all the best on your day.\" The moonling continued on his way.\n\nThe moonlings were quite different from Humans. Their society placed an incredible emphasis on politeness. When we first established contact back in 1669, the humans thought the moonlings were laying a trap because they were so unusually kind. They were so kind that they adopted the languages of the humans they met rather than speak their native tongue, which humans had difficulty enunciating. The entire moon was a single nation of like minded people. The moonlings had no government, but rather came to the same conclusions on most issues. Consensus always solved the rest. They even offered citizenship to all humans who migrated to the moon.\n\nThis social behavior was part of the reason that the earth was so well off. The moonlings were more than happy to share the knowledge of their race, including all their technology. This advanced the earth by a thousand years in the span of a day. The repercussions caused great chaos on earth. You see, the moonlings had no concept of religion. This caused resulted in humans on earth presuming that the religions they were taught must have been lies and they revolted against the religious. Others tried to start combat against the moonlings, claiming them blasphemers.\n\nHowever, the moonlings had dealt with these situations in the past, and provided weaponry to those who shared their opinions. This started the Great Cleansing, where tradition was brutally wiped from the Earth. Being far more advanced in technology, if not in spacecraft, the moonling weaponry made the battles one sided. In fact, today's parade was more about remembrance of the scar on Earth's history. It wasn't a parade remembering those died, it was a parade celebrating the planet's change for the better. It was the last major battle fought on earth.\n\nMike's attention was captured by the sky turning into a video panorama, flashing images of the Great Cleansing. It showed peasants being struck down by laser weaponry, the destruction of Constantinople by earth renders, shielded moonling soldiers crushing houses within armoured exoshells. The crowd cheered at the images. Mike smiled and cheered along.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418966456","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmzc1zl","link_id":"t3_2pr90k","name":"t1_cmzc1zl","parent_id":"t3_2pr90k","retrieved_on":1425322204,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":7}

He could hear #BADWORDS#led screaming though he couldn't make a sound. He passed out from the pain.\n\nHe awoke to a new understanding. He was inside a woman's stomach, in her womb. Tethered to his stomach was his lifeline. It had been tainted three days ago. He had almost left this place too early. What would have happened?\n\nHis brain continued to grow with his understanding. There was something new in the food tether that linked him to this woman. Something she had ingested had caused new 'nerves' to form in this umbilical cord.

{"archived":false,"author":"InternetPerso","body":"I #BADWORDS# LOVE this city. That's all there is to it. I got here half a year ago when the numbers started showing up. I was number 5,940,091..... ok...90, but I never could stand odd numbers, They're bad luck. Anyway I had no clue what my power was until these 2 cents were fighting it out down the street from a bar me and my buddy hung out at. Now usually we don't get to see many flashy fights, this part of town is where the mils hideout, the ones too weak to move up anywhere. One of em, some kind of explosion guy, got knocked straight through the wall next to me. Head crushed on impact. But get this, he dies but its not the guy who killed him whose number changes, it's mine. Just like that I went from being a mil to a thou. Oh he was livid. Standing there all shiny, covered in some kind of diamond. He was certain the guy wasn't dead, so he kept hitting the body looking at his number. Now by this point anyone with good sense was 50 feet away and running but something in the back of my head told me, touch his neck. He barely had enough time to look up at me before his head exploded. After the ringing in my ears went away I noticed it had happened again. This time I was a cent. After that day I began working my way up the ladder. Found a guy guy who thought he was invulnerable, turned out he still needed to breathe. Next I found a seer, took me almost 3 months to corner her, found a lot of good one along the way, Perfect memory, healing, the ability to talk to wolf spiders... ok so not all of them are useful, but their mine. Now, I'm number 1, everyone who knew me before is dead or worse. Set myself up in the old 1's mansion with some cute cents to wait on me living it up like a king.  Visions keep telling me that the city is about to try a full scale invasion, that's fine I... we are ready.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1418976179","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cmzf759","link_id":"t3_2ppg8d","name":"t1_cmzf759","parent_id":"t3_2ppg8d","retrieved_on":1425320607,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"TGnos","body":"  The future is never set in stone. In fact there are normally so many different possibilities that it hurts for Clairvoyants to see them all. But with practice, Clairvoyants can pinpoint a turning point; a crossroad that decides between two most drastic outcomes. \n\n  As you left the World Congress building, you realized that you do have a lot of spare mana stored up, what with missions getting few and far in between. With that, you decided to focus your powers on an unseemly child who passed by, looking afraid and lost.  \n\n  And the visions shocked you. Before your Eye, flashes the scene of the very building behind you bursting into flames while the child watched afar, and yet there was another possibility- the child walking away with his parents, alive and well. The visions then skipped into the future- visions of a hellscape, a man sitting upon his golden throne, slaves at his feet and a gaudy crown upon his head. Yet a tamer possibility existed- a future not unlike the present, depicting a shy florist working in the suburbs. You had always believed that nature triumphed nurture, but perhaps, you thought, the loss of his parents was enough to tip this boy over. \n\nYou rushed into building with the child, knowing you had only five minutes to get him and his parents out. You proceed to the information counter, get them to make an announcement and all that. 3 minutes left. The parents finally arrive. You paid them no heed, looking down at your watch and realizing there's little over a minute remained. Great. How would you persuade them to leave? \n\nBefore you could think up a coherent plan, the child dashed out of the building frantically. Oh well, at least he's helped you get the last stage settled. You rushed out together with the boy's parents, who catched up with the boy and scooped him up.  \n\n\"Oh kids these days, you know how they are,\" laughed the mother. \n\n\"Yeah I-\"\n\nThe mother turned around, she was smiling but her eyes were empty. \n\n\"Thank you so much\" she said, but her words sent a shiver down your spine. \n\nThey left and the building behind you burst into flames. There was screaming and blaring sirens and falling debris, but you could only stand there, shocked and rooted to the ground. You had opened your Eye just as they left, and the future was set in stone. The future would be hell.

{"archived":false,"author":"LovableCoward","body":"June 24th, 587 C.E. South Lyon, County Oakland, Kingdom of Laconia.\n\nThe music spilled out of the open door, the nighttime summer air wafting in. The Gilded Lion was the oldest tavern in the village of South Lyon, a small settlement of around three thousand people. The drinking house was located across the road from the train station, a curiously shaped structure that was aptly named for its appearance, the Witch's Hat. The tavern itself was built some hundred years earlier, one of the first buildings built in the area. It was two stories, with additional outbuildings for horses and the like. The proprietors lived in a seperate house connected to the pub by a covered walkway, a heavy wood gate enclosing the large courtyard. Hanging over the dirt road was the tavern's sign, a golden lion rampant with its name in gilded script. Picking his way around a pile of horse#BADWORDS#, Rhys Paget walked under the sign and into the public house, eyes  adjusting to the brightness.\n\nThe place was crowded as was usual for a Saturday night, the menfolk of the village meeting to drink and discuss. Over in one corner Rhys' friend William Clemens sat with a book in hand, a glass of cider in front of him. Two of Rhy's neighbors sat playing backgammon next to the fire, the flames more for the light than anything else, though plenty of candles lit up the place anyways. Matt Barrows sat in a cluster of men, a small pile of coins next to him from his game of five finger fillet, the blade a blur in his fist. Paget didn't worry too much, for all his boisterousness, Barrows knew when to call it. Not willing to disturb either friend, he instead made his way to the counter, and smiled as he saw who was manning bar.\n\nElisabeth Krauze smiled in return and then turned around to fill an empty mug from one of the barrels opposite the bar. She pulled on the handle and let the glass stein fill with a rich dark beer, wiping off the excess foam before setting it in front of Paget. He picked it up and sipped with relish. He tasted the malted barley notes and what Paget was told was chocolate. No one except nobility or the king had access to that bean from the South, far too expensive to produce and ship to make it available to lower classes.  Swallowing, he nodded.\n\n\"Best porter in the entire kingdom.\" He stated. The barmaid merely scoffed. \n\n\"Shameless flatterer, and exactly how many places have you been to, Rhys?\"\n\n\"I've been to Detroit twice.\"\n\n\"Twice?!\" Miss Elisabeth Krauze said in mock-amazement, holding a delicate hand on her blouse. \"Stars, you are a regular Allen Traveler. Rhys, you haven't been more than sixty miles away from here in your entire life. You might say my father's beer is the best, but you haven't been to Rapid City. The beer there... I will say with pride that our beer is the best in County Oakland, but the entire kingdom? That'd be pushing it. Anyways, something to eat?\"\n\n\"Yes please, Lisa. What's ready?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Aside from perpetual stew, there's a nice haunch of venison ready to be made into gyros. Want fries with it?\"\n\nPaget smiled, his grin bright in the well lit common room.\n\n\"Sounds great. I take it.\"\n\nThe barmaid disappeared to take care of his order and so Paget turned his attention to the crowd. The music died down, the accordion player bowing to the applause before returning to his drink. Another patron, an aged graybeard of a man stepped up in front of the fireplace, setting himself down in one of the stuffed chairs. The drinker seated next to Paget, Peter Rook of Ten Mile whispered to him under his voice.\n\n\"Old man Tellers. This should either be good or #BADWORDS# terrible.\"\n\nThe shriveled man was likely the oldest person in the entire village, most people agreed he was around 94 give or take. His sight was gone, as was most of his hearing but the rest of his faculties worked just fine. \n\n\"When I was a boy, not more than ten years old, my grandfather told me what his great-grandfather told him and so on and so forth. I'm not too sure of the dates tell you the truth, they used a different calendar from us, but it was in the year 2215. Whatever that was. He said that the continent was united once, under one banner with no kings of any kind. They chose their rulers like they do in New England does. The richest and well-to-do would bribe the people will drink and entertainment so they choose them over others. He said that they could do magic, like bring people back from the dead or fly. Even go to the moon.\"\n\nThe whole tavern laughed at the thought of that; the pointlessness of it. The old man nodded in agreeance. \n\n\"I'm only saying what he told me, and he was a notorious liar. I don't believe it for a second. But apparently there was other, just as powerful places with weapons unimaginable and they went to war over the world. Their actions angered the gods and so were punished with the very same weapons they built. They wiped away hundreds of cities, tore down the towers of glass and nearly killed every person on earth. At least that's what he told me.\"\n\nThe old man spoke a while more but not many paid him heed. Weapons that could destroy entire cities, talking suits of armor? The stuff of fairy tales.

This particular house has a peculiar way about it: in my can only be claimed by those who can conquer their fears. Many people have tried to win the gorgeous Victorian style house equipped with the latest utilities and gadgets. This house sits on a reflective lake in a breathtaking valley. The builder of this house enchanted it upon completion to use a visitor's worst fears against them. A sign planted in the front yard that describes the challenge to any how happen upon it, it reads: \"I issue a challenge to you traveller. Beginning at the front door, venture through the house and arrive at the trunk in the attic. In this trunk lies the deed and keys. Beat the house and it's yours, but beware, your truest fears will haunt you until you obtain the trunk's contents.\" \n    \"This doesn't seem so bad!\" declares Eustace. \n    \"Yeah!\" Elise answers, \"Piece of cake.\"\n    Eustace and Elise believe that they aren't afraid of anything, thus making the house easy pickings. Under the sign hangs a box and reads \"Map\". They take one. \n    \"Wow could this be easier hahaha!\" Eustace exclaims in an arrogant confidence. \"Let's do this.\" \n    They turn the knob and open the door and stare in at a white empty room. Their footsteps echo through the room. \n    \"Hello?\" Elise questions. No answer. \n     Upon observing the nothingness of the room Eustace notices, \"hey you think that's the back door? I mean, it's no help but... yeah\" \n    \"Hey! It's tons of help!\" Elise retorts, \"I don't know about you but I can't see any walls and the first turn through this room is just before it. I hope the whole house isn't like this, we'll never find the attic.\"\n    This was true, the room was blank not a seam for the walls, floor and ceiling or even a shadow. There were no fixtures and all that was visible sat on the opposite end of the room. A lone window pane that looked out at the lake and a doorknob. The couple walked to it and gazed upon the beauty of the scene that they would soon live on. \n    \"So it's our back door, huh?\" inquired Eustace arrogantly once again. \n    Elise chuckled, \"Not yet ours, darling\"\n    Eustace made a sigh and pulled Elise to his side and she embraced him. \n    \"Well, plenty of time for this soon!\" Eustace exclaimed arrogantly, yet again, \"Race you to the top!\" As he takes off around the corner, he suddenly stops. In front of him lies an actual room. A large living room with a roaring fire. \n    \"Wow come look at this!\" Eustace celebrates running to Elise to bring her his way and stops confused again. He sees the foyer it is beautifully adorned with hooks on either side of the door and a large glass pane that runs the length of the hallway across the ceiling with hardwood floors and a plain white paint on the walls. His confusion persists as he looks around. \n    \"Where had Elise gone?\" he wonders. \"She must be trying to trick him to beat him to the attic.\" \n    \"Haha!\" erupts a voice from the silence, \"Gotcha!\" \n    It's Elise! Gah, how could he let her get this one over on him!\n    \"Alright ,cheater, here I come!\" Eustace challenges and rounds the corner. \n    When he reaches the stairs he yells for her, \"Elise? Hellooooo!\" No answer. As he walks up the stairs looking he calls again. No answer still. \"Elise?\" he stamers, \"It's not funny, come on! I wanna go with you!\"\n    A scream pierces the long silence. Eustace sprints, in a near panic, to the source of the sound. Elise is sitting in a chair, looking at a picture. \n    \"Ha ok you got me now let's g...\" he freezes upon seeing her. Go turns into a gasp as he looks upon her dead body with blood trickling from her sliced neck. \n    \"Hey, why'd you leave me?\" he hears from the door. \n    \"Elise!\" he blurts relieved. He looks back at the chair which is now empty. Relieved, Eustace runs to his girlfriend and throws his arms around her. \"Oh I thought I had lost you.\" As he pulls away he observes a rope around her neck. \"NO.\" he screams as he desperately removes the noose. \n    She chokes out \"Why, Eustace? We're not afriad of anything.\" \n    \"Thought I wasn't,\" he speaks through tears. \n    Just as suddenly she's gone. Eustace gasps and tears through the house to the next set of stairs only to find Elise laying at the bottom. He slows to a trot then a walk and collapses to his knees. \n    \"No,\" he whispers his arrogant tone now gone, \"Get up! Let's get you to a hospital.\"\n    Elise coughs and attempts to stand only to cough again spraying blood and falls back to the floor. \n\"C'mon baby get up we gotta go!\" he desperately chokes out. He hoists Elise on he back only to face a plain white room. \"No,\" he stamers, \"It got me. But I wasn't afriad of anything.\" Eustace brings Elise into his arms, \"At least until I met you.\" Tears roll down his face as he pulls a black, felt box from his pocket. He flips it open and removed the contents. With a shaky hand he slides a ring onto Elise's finger. \"I love you,\" his voice shakes. \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419150673","downs":0,"edited":"1419154067","gilded":0,"id":"cn16dvl","link_id":"t3_2ps4r9","name":"t1_cn16dvl","parent_id":"t3_2ps4r9","retrieved_on":1425290486,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"billyshambles","body":"Every day was the same and I was sick of it. I hadn’t said a word for weeks. At work I could get away with it. I’m a developer and communicate only via email. Headphones go on in the morning and no-one approaches me until I race out the door at night. It’s glorious. \n\nI have the utmost respect for the sales team. How they manage it I don’t know. All day spent selling to clients. And tech support are the best paid workers in the world. Imagine having to rhyme with the world’s finest morons all day. The guys are geniuses, but they burn out young. It’s a dangerous game.\n\nToday was different for me. Today I had to hold a conversation. I had been tense all morning and now the moment had finally arrived. Today I had to buy a television. I took a deep breath and pushed through the door.\n\nI casually sauntered towards a 48”, hoping not to be noticed. Still, I saw him approach with a plastic smile upon his face. My gut tightened and I broke into a cold sweat. “Can I offer you any assistance?” So it begins.\n\n“My old TV met with some resistance.” It was no lie. I’d thrown the controller through the panel after a 5-0 loss in FIFA. “Would you recommend any sets?”\n\nHe pointed towards a large TV screwed to the wall. “Sony are the best.” That was rough, not the best of rhymes, but I think he got away with it. “Though did you hear about North Korea?” \n\nChrist, this way getting out of hand. Talk about a curveball. We were down the rabbit hole now and I had to roll with it. It took me a moment before I could form a reply. “The execs have verbal diarrhoea,” I said. Time to get out of this before something went awry. “Look, I just want to buy a television.”\n\nThe poor man looked taken aback. But I was doing us both a favour. “Sir, there’s no need for such derision. I’ll bring the TV to the checkout.” \n\n“There’s no need to pout,” I said under my breath. I followed him to the till. No-one dared to make eye-contact as I strolled through the store. Not a soul of them wished to get trapped in one of these interminable chats. I smiled at him apologetically as he rang up my purchase. “Sorry about my mood.”\n\nHe seemed a little relieved himself, now we were almost safe. “Let’s not start a feud,” he said. “How would you like to pay?”\n\nI patted my pockets, then searched them frantically. “This just isn’t my day. I’m after forgetting my wallet.” I knew immediately my mistake. I had condemned the man. He stared at me with his eyes wide open. Sweat drenched him in an instant.\n\n“I…ah…well. Let’s see…” An alarm sounded. They would be on him in mere moments. He had no rhyme. I couldn’t think of one myself. What had I done? \n\nThey crashed through the door, weapons raised. “Sir, put your hands in the air. This is a code orange.”\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419170917","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn1a0xe","link_id":"t3_2pyop0","name":"t1_cn1a0xe","parent_id":"t3_2pyop0","retrieved_on":1425288717,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":4}
{"archived":false,"author":"user1444","body":"\"What?\"  Hank was confused.  He had been laying on his couch watching football, and now he was standing in a giant ancient stadium filled with thousands of people.  It certainly didn't feel like a dream but it had to be.  Things didn't get any less confusing when 2 giant \"warriors\" came running at him with a sword, and a large pole with a #BADWORDS#ed ball at the end.  He was about to start running away but they stopped in front of him, and offered him the weapons.\n\nWhat the hell is going on here?  He asked the scary guys with crazy weapons.  \"Chose your weapon.\"  He was told.  \"Why the hell do I need a weapon?  Where am I?\"  They did not reply.  So he grabbed both of the weapons from the men and begun to threaten him, but they walked away.  The crowds were cheering loudly now, chanting something he couldn't make out.  He did see another man in \"the ring\" with him, approaching.  \"Jesus.. Who the #BADWORDS# is THAT!?\"  Hank said out loud to nobody in particular.\n\nThe guy who was apparently his opponent was even taller then him, and he stood at 6'4.  The guy was wearing what looked like heavy steel armour (which Hank just realized he was wearing himself somehow, \"thanks for that at least\".) The man was twice Hanks width, and Hank was a very strong man.  He was carrying a large #BADWORDS# sword, the best description.  It was 5 and a half feet long, 3 inches wide and looked crueler then his ex wife.  It didn't look like the man was coming over to talk.\n\nHank dropped his own sword which was much smaller and held the evil pole with the scary metal #BADWORDS#e ball at the end.  It was at least long enough to stay out of the reach of that gigantic shard of iron.  He really wished he had his gun, any of them, the M16 would make short work of that armour and anybody inside, but even his 9mm would be enough to take the guys head off before that sword got close.  He was basically unarmed though, because quite frankly he had no idea what the hell to do with this mace on a pole, it sure looked dangerous, but how was he supposed to use it?  He had to figure it out though because the man had just launched at him from 20 feet away and was bringing that sword around ridiculously fast.\n\nHank ducked, and felt the wind over his head as the sword missed.  \"Holy #BADWORDS#!\"  The man was already regaining control of the missed cut and bringing it around again.  Hank recklessly #BADWORDS# the #BADWORDS#e ball towards the mans face, but he moved aside like he knew it was coming, and brought the sword up in an uppercut.  Hank jumped back, but the tip hit his armour and pushed him off balance, and the screech of metal on metal burned his ears.  \"#BADWORDS# this\" he thought, and dropped his death staff on the ground as the man brought the sword around again.  Hank tackled him and took out his legs, the man dropped the sword and Hank got on top.  This was his game now, he didn't know how to use these brutal weapons, but he had a couple of his own, his left and right.  Which he delivered to the larger man, over and over, going for a fourth punch though, his wrist was caught, and nearly crushed in a grip.  Another hand came up around his throat, and suddenly he was thrown a good 4 feet away, and the man was getting up as Hank wondered what the hell had happened.\n\nHe realized all 240lbs of him was just thrown through the air like a paper air plane..  Now he was scared, there was no fighting this man head on, and that's exactly what he was doing now, running at Hank unarmed like a football player looking for the kill.  Hank jumped down at the last second and the man tripped over him, but the force still knocked him on his own ass.  The man was jumping up and coming again, and Hank was still on the ground.  He grabbed a handful of sand and flung it in the mans face.  He stopped his charge and screamed, clawing at his face.\n\nThis was his chance he knew, he picked up the mans own huge sword, which didn't seem any less scary in his own hands.  And he swung it in a sidestroke at the mans head as hard as he could.  Turns out wielding a video game sized sword is difficult without training.  Hanks blow caught the man in the center of the breast plate and lost all it's force.  The man grabbed for the blade, but Hank pulled it back, and took a step back.  \"Stay back, Stay back!  I'm warning you, I'll #BADWORDS# kill you man, I don't want to but you aren't giving me a choice here!\"  He tried bluffing, hoping the man would decide it wasn't worth the trouble.  He did not.\n\nHe charged Hank again, and he brought the sword up planning on bringing it right down on the mans head as he got close, but he wasn't fast enough with it, he had to let the sword go mid swing to jump to the side and out of the way of a takedown that surely would have ended everything.  The man came at him again.  In Hanks last clumsy movement he had noticed there was a dagger on his hip, so he drew it.  The man straight on came at him again, so Hank faked left, and jumped right, as he threw a wild cut at the mans face.  There was red, and a grunt of pain.  He had cut him, and cut him good.  Which he was now starting to think was a bad idea, terrible idea.\n\nThe man didn't look hurt, despite the fact he had a deep cut opening his cheek up, he simply looked ANGRY..  He charged Hank again but this time managed to grab a hold of Hanks leg as he jumped aside, and pulled him down so hard Hank had to check if his leg was still attached.  He tried to wrestle with the man, he knew some groundwork, but this man was a sa#BADWORDS#e, far too strong, and the armour wasn't helping his movement any.  It didn't take long for the man to get on top of Hank.  In desperation Hank pushed the dagger into one of the joints of the mans armour, it only went through a few inches, but enough to cut him.  The man simply laughed, and delivered his own punch to Hanks face.\n\nStars, white lights, numbness, confusion.  Had he just been punched in the face, or was he standing within 10 feet of an IED when it went off?  Hard to tell, either way he had to do something.  His vision was blurry as he tried to reach for the mans throat, he couldn't reach.  Suddenly the man had Hanks dagger and was pressing the tip to Hanks adams apple.  \"I give up, you win, whatever, please don't\"  He managed to say, this was all so ridiculous.  \"You gave up, but I didn't win yet.\" Replied the man, and he almost gently pushed the dagger into Hanks adams apple, to the hilt.  Hank was in shock, he couldn't speak, or breathe, he was freezing suddenly and didn't feel anything but the cold, and then it stopped.\n\nThe man raised his hands in victory, and the crowds cheers shook the stadium, he strutted off the sand and through an exit.  Slaves came out, collected the weapons, dragged off the body, raked the sand smooth and clean of blood again, and went through another exit.  The crowd waited in anticipation.  There was a brilliant flash of orange light in the sand.  Suddenly, a 26 year old accountant named Dave appeared.  He looked around confused, pushed up his glasses and looked simply stunned.  The crowds began to chant something he couldn't make out.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419179419","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn1cn9b","link_id":"t3_2pyw8u","name":"t1_cn1cn9b","parent_id":"t3_2pyw8u","retrieved_on":1425287496,"score":38,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":38}

They say your life flashes before your eyes right before you die and its true. I watched it, my life, uneventful but ultimately pleasant. I watched it pass and watched myself pass up moments, avoid hardships, dodge calamities. I was happy. Then I stood at the end of it all and look at the nice neat little line of events I had left behind. Not knowing what to do I took a seat at the tail end of my life and waited for whatever came next.\n\n\"Hey\" a voice from nowhere came and spoke.\n\n\"what?\" I responded\n\n\"what are you doing?\" it asked\n\n\"I dunno, what am I supposed to do?\" I asked it back\n\n\"Whatever you want. You're sitting outside of time now.\" It replied with some finality.\n\nI sighed and lay down, staring up into complete white nothingness. After a while I got fed up with the stagnant boredom and walked around a bit. Up and down my boring life, reviewing the pleasant moments, skipping past the bad. I don't know how long I did this for before getting bored again but eventually something caught my eye. Something I haden't seen before. A branch in my life during a key decision I had skipped by staying home that day. After an eternity of the same old same old I decided\n\n\"eh, why the hell not\"\n\nand walked the branch. I saw many things walking down the branch. Incredible pain, heartbreak, tremendous loss, embarrassing failure but I also saw greater happiness than had ever existed in my old life, success, and the dog I had always wished I had adopted. I could see all this but I couldn't really feel it. It was like trying to eat that steak on the food network through the tv. It just didnt work that way. I tried everything I could think of to try to bring those moments within me but nothing I did was satisfying.\n\n\"Hey, what're you doing?\" The voice asked me again after a while.\n\n\"I don't know. You said I could do whatever I wanted. Why can't I experience these moments?\" I asked it.\n\n\"You already chose not to. I can't control what you choose to do.\" It replied.\n\nand so I walked an eternity. seeing the infinite possibilities of what could have been, what should have been, but had never come to be.

The serfs of that land were a simple folk, and their lords were content enough to leave them be most of the year. In fact, the tavern would soon celebrate the day furthest from any taxes.\n\nUlrik, the stocky tavern owner, had an eye out for any good entertainers he could hire for the coming festivities. Bards, being cunning gentlemen, could always tell when a barkeep was doing this, and thus one was attempting to show off to the tipsy, cheerful crowd. His current piece was a telling of an old wive's tale, one of those ones about the sky falling.\n\n\"But the dwarves they wouldn't turn back,\" he sang, playing the odd note on his lute.\n\n\"As the sky above them turned black,\" he continued, aware that he was being well received. He winked at a particularly encapsulated lady nearby between two of his lines.\n\n\"With their swords and shields at the ready,\n\n\"Came the cry 'Ever stubborn and steady!'\n\n\"Engulfed in the mists, that eddies and twists,\n\n\"They met their doom, amidst the gloom,\" he burst into a short instrumental, quickly reminding himself of the next verse. A few cheers went up from drunken fans and he flashed them a grin in return.\n\n\"Then rode the warriors of the plains,\n\n\"Forgetting their ill-gotten gains,\n\n\"They charged deep into the advancing fog,\" he bellowed, every breath of his voice echoing enthusiasm as he played his piece.\n\n\"Joining the dwarves in their desperate slog,\n\n\"Suffocated and rent, bones snapped and bent,\n\n\"Despite their charge, the murk did enlarge,\" more cheers filled the tavern as the bard began another instrumental. Ulrik, sitting behind the bar, nodded to himself, pleased to have found such a popular entertainer. Once the playing was finished he would make sure to approach this maestro of lute and song.\n\n\"Then the elves as valiant as-\n\n\"Enough!\" thundered an old man sitting at the back of the tavern. Everyone, including the bard, fell quiet. For a while it seemed even the crackling of the fire and the pattering of the rain dared not break the silence. The old man stood at his table, firelight illuminating his wrinkled and worn face as he slowly paced towards the bard.\n\n\"Why do you claim such noble acts occurred, when none such did?\" inquired the man. The bard sneered in return, unimpressed by the elderly figure that strode towards him. He composed an adequately theatrical and mocking response.\n\n\"And I suppose you were there to see otherwise, were you?\" questioned the bard, getting a few laughs from drunkards near the bar.\n\n\"Aye,\" replied the man, looking the bard dead in the eyes.

If anyone had shattered the social standard, it was that guy.\n\n“I’m fine,” Chuck said, turning his attention back toward the wall ahead of him.\n\n“Everything going well on your end?” the man replied, the sound of his urine still audible as it crashed down onto the plastic mat below.\n\n“I guess so,” Chuck said. He was actually having a bit of trouble going, a little “stage fright,” as his friends back home called it, but didn’t think it was necessary to mention. Something about having a conversation with the man next to him following brief eye contact made it a little difficult to pee.\n\n“Hang on,” the man said. “Some freak next to me is trying to talk to me while I’m peeing.”\n\nChuck leaned backward slightly and peaked around the man’s shoulder. The urinal next to him was empty, save for a small puddle of what Chuck guessed wasn’t water on the floor beneath it. Either there was a tiny man hiding just out of his vision, or Chuck had made a terrible mistake.\n\nThe man turned toward Chuck and shook his head slightly, a small, metal object attached to his right ear. \n\n“What do you want?” he said.\n\n“Sorry,” Chuck said, turning his attention to the light blue tiling above the urinal ahead of him. “I thought you were talking to me.”\n\n“Freak,” the man said, taking a step to his right and resuming his admittedly impressive stream against a new, child-sized, urinal. \n\nChuck sighed and zipped up his fly, admitting defeat. He still had to pee, still had a burning sensation in his bladder, but knew there were other bathrooms he could use. He didn’t need to continue embarrassing himself at this particular one. He turned and walked toward the sink, immediately making eye contact with a man in a maroon suit standing next to it. He held a soap bottle in his hand, a series of towels stacked behind him. If anything, the guy looked more like he belonged outside of a hotel entrance than inside of a Macy’s bathroom.\n\nThe suited man smiled at Chuck as he walked up to the sink, the bottle of soap held out in Chuck’s direction. He stared back for a moment, unsure of exactly what was going on. He’d never had a stranger offer him a bottle of soap before, but didn’t exactly mind the idea of free stuff. After all, he was running low on soap at home – it would save him the extra trip of buying another. He leaned forward and grabbed the bottle of soap out of the man’s hand, then slipped it into his back pocket. It fit almost perfectly, as if it were made specifically to slide in there. \n\n“Thanks,” Chuck said, smiling at the man in the suit. He leaned forward and began washing his hands in the sink ahead. He could feel the man next to him staring at him, studying him. Chuck glanced back at him. His head was tilted to the side, a distorted expression on his face as if something were out of the ordinary, as if Chuck were the one acting strangely. Here was a man literally handing out soap in a men’s bathroom, yet suddenly Chuck was the weird one. \n\n“Sir?” the man said, glancing at Chuck’s rear pocket. “What are you doing?”\n\n“What do you mean?” Chuck said, his voice cracking heavily at the start of his sentence. It had been almost two decades since he had gone through #BADWORDS#rty, yet still his voice just seemed to abruptly decide it was time to shatter a few windows. He cleared his throat in an attempt to hide his sudden soprano.\n\n“You took my soap.”\n\n“What?” Chuck said, his voice again cracking. He cleared his throat again, then repeated his “what” in a much deeper voice.\n\n“You put the soap in your pocket, I need that.”\n\n“But I thought you were giving it to me?” Chuck said. \n\n“I was going to squeeze it into your hand, I’m a bathroom attendant.”\n\nChuck froze. He had no idea why he hadn’t thought the guy was a bathroom attendant. The suit, the hat, the stacks of towels, it made so much more sense than him just being some weirdo hanging out in the men’s bathroom. He was there to help move things along, to wash hands and squeeze soap. \n\n“I am so sorry,” Chuck said, immediately pulling his soaking hands out of the sink and grabbing the bottle of soap from his back pocket. A cold, wet feeling spread across his behind as he pulled the bottle out. He knew he’d just accidentally squeezed it against the back of his pants, and now likely had a giant stain in its place, but he’d already made a fool of himself enough. It would be best not to draw attention to it. He turned to the left to hide his pants, then handed the soap back to the attendant.\n\n“Thank you,” the man said, placing it back on the counter. \n\nChuck returned his hands to the sink, then waited. He needed soap, needed something to scrub in his hands, but wasn’t sure of the process exactly. Did he wait until the man offered him some? Would he offer him some? Chuck wouldn’t if he were in his situation, he’d already had enough time with the bottle. Plus, Chuck knew he needed to get out of the bathroom—he didn’t want to wait around anymore, it had been long enough. He casually lowered his hand and rubbed it against the back of his pants, lathering it in the soap he’d recently applied to his jeans. \n\n“The #BADWORDS# are you doing?” said a voice from behind Chuck. It was clearly the man from the urinal before, the voice of a man who already had a pretty obvious disdain for Chuck.\n\n“Nothing,” Chuck said, immediately returning his hand to his front. “I was just, uh, soaping. I was soaping my hand.”\n\n“Are you insane?” the man said.\n\n“No,” Chuck said. “I just--I needed soap.”\n\n“Hang on,” the man said, glancing up at Chuck through the mirror. “The #BADWORDS# freak is talking to me again.” He paused. “What the hell do you want?”\n\n“Sorry,” Chuck said, “I thought you were talking to me.” He stared down at the sink and focused intently on it, hoping that he might disappear if he thought hard enough.\n\n“Well I wasn’t,” the man said. He glanced down at Chuck’s pants. “Did you #BADWORDS# yourself? Did you #BADWORDS# yourself and then rub it on your hands?”\n\nChuck stared at the man in the mirror. Was he talking to Chuck or did he ask that to whomever was on the phone? It was so specific, so oddly cir#BADWORDS#stantial. Still, he had no idea, but knew it was probably best to ignore it. He returned his hands to the sink and began lathering them up, the soap from his pants working well enough. He had to get out of there, had to go home.  \n\n“I’m talking to you now,” the man said. To whom? Was it Chuck or the guy on the phone? He had no idea, he was so confused. He continued washing his hands, focusing everything he had on the way the water cascaded down his palms. He still had to pee so badly, but he needed to get out of there.\n\n“Here you go, sir,” the attendant said, finally holding out the soap bottle. Chuck had clearly just finished lathering his hands up, but figured it would be rude to reject the offer. He turned around and placed his hand under the nozzle of the soap, then waited. The attendant stared at him, his head tilted slightly.\n\n“What are you doing?” he said, pulling the soap back slightly.\n\n“I thought,” Chuck stammered, glancing at the bottle. “Soap. Hand soap.” He had given up on full sentences.\n\n“Not for you,” the attendant said, nodding toward the Bluetooth man. \n\nChuck spun around back toward the sink. He had to get out of there, it was becoming too much. He reached his hand out toward the towels, immediately knocking them over and instead punching the mirror behind. \n\n“Sorry,” Chuck shouted, his voice again cracking. He lunged forward to grab the towels as they fell, instead pushing them directly into the still-running sink, his footing slipping out from beneath him. He tried to catch himself on the edge of the counter, yet instead smacked his chin against it with a tremendous slap. He fell to the floor, the room slowly losing color as his vision faded. Although he realized he was likely going unconscious, he remained acutely aware of the warm liquid that was now running down the interior of his pant legs. At least he knew he no longer needed to pee, and that the ordeal was now probably over.  \n\n____________________\n\n^If ^you ^enjoy ^my ^writing ^style, ^feel ^free ^to ^check ^out ^some ^of ^my ^other ^short ^stories [^in ^my ^new ^subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChokingVictimWrites/) ^or [^on ^my ^website!](http://wordsontheinternet.org/)\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419353499","downs":0,"edited":"1423084336","gilded":0,"id":"cn3dap5","link_id":"t3_2q6mb0","name":"t1_cn3dap5","parent_id":"t3_2q6mb0","retrieved_on":1425252394,"score":874,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":874}

{"archived":false,"author":"PhantomandaRose","body":"There's obviously no ultimate authority on this, and I'm sure there are conflicting sources, but I think the popular view (drawing from Catholic theology and Dante) is that Limbo is reserved for good people who died before Christ was born and opened the way to heaven. What you want, I think, is Vestibule. According to Dante, Vestibule is an area just outside hell reserved for people who committed their lives neither to good nor to evil.\n\nThe difference is that people such as Socrates (and, according to popular opinion, unbaptized infants) had no choice. Before Christ, heaven was not an option. There is a legend (not doctrine) called the harrowing of hell, which suggests Jesus Christ descended into hell and \"saved\" a select few (such as Adam, iirc) from limbo. Vestibule, however, is a place for people who could make the choice between good and evil, but chose not to. A classic example is Pontius Pilate, who could have condemned Jesus to death or saved him; instead, he let the masses choose for him.\n\nI really like the 30 minutes idea.

Centuries of struggle and strife and longing, and he was the first to make it.\n\nHe used the hem of his dusty shirt to wipe the sweat from his head and took a long draft from his canteen. He savored it- he knew it would most likely be his last.\n\nSitting in the shade of The Obelisk, Marcus experienced his first pitiful relief from the relentless sun since about two days. He figured he had earned the rest.\n\nHe thought back to the beginning of his journey: to the king, the ruler of the capital, looking at him with eyes of disapproval. He thought too of the queen, remembering that when he first saw her that the phrase \"your majesty\" hardly did her justice. In that first instant, he had felt a twinge of doubt, just a twinge; however, he had every confidence his plan would work.\n\n\"King Henry, your steward announced why I was hear, and I can see a decision in you already,\" Marcus began. \"It is more than understandable and I have of course heard of your wisdom.\" A little flattery never hurt, did it? \"However, my king, I urge you to let me finish. If nothing else, I have already single-handedly changed the course of history in your kingdom forever.\" Henry #BADWORDS#ed an eyebrow. The queen remained inscrutable. Marcus continued quickly, \"Since the beginning of time our people have lived here in the capital. We've searched and scoured every possible part of our world, and no where else have we seen something like it. Something so mysterious, something so wonderful, something so completely *awesome*.\" Marcus was getting in to it now. He forged ahead passionately, \"Of course I speak of the Obelisk. Every scouting party, every expedition loaded with water and supplies and animals for the slaughter- never has one made it back. Men more brilliant than I have concluded that The Obelisk must be enormous to appear so close, so within our grasp, that it appears one could make the journey in an afternoon. Well, my king, I am here to tell you that, finally, after millennia, it *is* within our grasp.\"\n\nThis final statement did not quite have the gravitas Marcus had hoped. The king looked bored and the queen looked kindly on with a mild pity as if to say, \"oh sweetie.\"\n\nBefore Marcus could continue, Henry raised a hand to cut him off. \"Marcus. We have heard of you. We have heard of your brilliance, your fantastic deeds, your ingenious solutions to ancient problems, but this, this problem, this is beyond you. It is beyond all of us. The Obelisk is and shall remain a mystery.\" The king's gaze softened slightly. \"I do not want to lose another brilliant soul to that sa#BADWORDS#e desert. You know there have been scholars, scientists, and philosophers who have all tried and who have all failed at this task. What makes you think you can succeed where they have failed?\" Marcus had hoped he would ask that; with the most staunch face he could muster he said, \"With all due respect, sir, they couldn't fly.\"\n\n**part 2 is somewhere else in the thread.

A few people in line behind Marcus who were waiting to see the king didn't bother to be polite about their amu#BADWORDS#t.

Lead the way.\"\n\nAfter he had seen his machine and the short demonstration Marcus had set up, the king really had no choice but to grant his approval for Marcus's mission on the condition that Marcus leave his plans for the flying contraption with the court scientist. The king knew now that Marcus was right. No matter what happened, he had single-handedly changed the course of the kingdom forever.\n\n...\n\nThat was all well and good until his plane crashed two days into his journey. At first things had been going so well. He had had a strong wind at his back for the entire flight, and by the rate The Obelisk was growing on the horizon he estimated it would have taken him only a few more hours to reach it before the disaster. He gave a quick prayer of thanks for having survived the crash then grabbed his canteen and set on his way.\n\nAt that point, the great Obelisk was bigger than he could ever have imagined. His brain literally could not accept the size of it. So, he ended up looking down for most of the walk, glancing up sparingly to make sure of his path. It took him almost exactly two days to reach The Obelisk.\n\nAnd now he was here. Sitting against it. \n\n\"Well let's take a proper look, shall we?\" He got up, using The Obelisk for support.  As he was rising, he pushed his right hand against it, and, suddenly, his hand sank into it! A rectangular chunk of the obelisk almost exactly the size of his hand depressed about two inches into the jet black wall. He simply gave it a confused look until he heard a great grinding noise, and then he jumped back as quickly as he could. He stared, slack jawed, as a great gate was being lowered. It seemed to lower as if by magic, it required no chains or pulleys like the gate at the king's castle. Marcus seemed to know right away that there was no way he would be able to discern how it worked.\n\nThe gate met the ground with barely a whisper of shifting sand. Marcus stared for two minutes before deciding there was no point in *not* going in. He took what were surely the most important steps of his life and entered The Obelisk. \n\nAt first it was dark. Then one by one lights started to come to life all around him. They were strange lights. They held a stable glow. The did not flicker and dance like a candle flame, and these lights came in every color of the rainbow! Even stranger, they were all perfect squares. \n\nHe walked to the wall straight in front of him to get a closer look, and saw that each glowing square was actually raised slightly out of the wall. He put his hand closer to a green one and felt no heat coming from it, so he touched it with his finger. It was slightly warm, but no where near hot like a lantern. He tapped the strange light a few times and suddenly it depressed just like the wall outside.\n\nThe wall! It was closing behind him, much faster than it had opened. He panicked, trying to get back out before it closed, but it was too late; Marcus was trapped in The Obelisk.\n\nBefore he could ruminate on his fate, something else began happening. More and more of those strange square lights came on, but now the were turning on and off and in short half-second intervals, almost like they were winking at him. A hum began to fill the air. He looked around wildly. Marcus was filled with a sense of dread as the inside of The Obelisk came alive around him.\n\nBy now the hum had turned into a full on vibration. Marcus thought he must have angered God for touching His Obelisk and now He was trying to shake him out. He began to pray and cry at the same time. The vibrations continued and increased steadily.\n\nAll of a sudden, Marcus was aware of a new sensation. He felt heavier than he had ever felt in his life. The pressure on him increased and increased until he was forced to a knee, then forced to lie face down on the floor. The pressure increased until it was almost unbearable- then, with no warning, the pressure was gone. \n\n...\n\nPeople in the capital still talk about him from time to time. The new generations don't believe their grandparents. They didn't believe in their crazy story about Obelisks that shoot fire from their behinds. Why do old people make things like that up? Didn't they think the world was interesting enough? People could fly like birds for goodness sake! Still it's better to be polite and listen, they are from a different time after all.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419579162","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn5mpd5","link_id":"t3_2qeifv","name":"t1_cn5mpd5","parent_id":"t3_2qeifv","retrieved_on":1425212547,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

As far as intentions go, my bookworm friend has told me that, in literary analysis, it is important (in one school of thought, at least) to disregard the authors intentions, and anything you are able to find in the text counts as something you have found, regardless of whether the author intended it that way.  \n\nI would question the notion that more wordiness is better in this instance, for several reasons.  The tone and psychology of the narrator is such that excessive description would be erroneous, as they are mentally and physically exhausted.  Furthermore, what is being described is wreckage, which is something that an exhausted person may not care to really describe all that thoroughly.  Lastly, as was my original point, I am not altogether opposed to the idea of repe#BADWORDS#on, and I thought it sounded rather elegant in this case, more so than wordiness for wordiness' sake.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419622490","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn5yj02","link_id":"t3_2qevv3","name":"t1_cn5yj02","parent_id":"t1_cn5rcim","retrieved_on":1425207009,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

Many of the entries were small things \"I will to go out with so and so\" or \"I will find money on the floor\"  before big things. \n\n\n\nIt also seemed you couldn't override other written words.

Except for those events already commanded by the book. \n\n\n\nI still didn't believe it. And i was a fool. I kept the book around and didn't use it until a couple of weeks after i had found it. I wrote a simple command. The girl I'd liked since freshman year would like me. I waited all day until the last period and she seemed more friendly. And she invited me to a party that night. \n\n\n\nSo the book earned my trust. And after studying it a bit more. All the writers made one big command before the book changed author. Who i assumed was Hitler made 2 entries before writing the succession of his country. And who i assumed was George Washington wrote 3 pages before the creation of his country. I never knew why they stopped writing. Maybe they didn't need it anymore. \n\n\n\nI did more small thing. Better grades, finding money on the ground, to more bigger things, making people around me love me, perfect scores on my SAT/ACT.

{"archived":false,"author":"ModernMrDarcy","body":"Harry stood, covered in the rubble from his final fight with the dark lord. Images flashed before his mind, the Longbottom boy decapitating the snake with the sword, watching Blaise duel with two death eaters at once, his final desperate expelliarmus that had won the day. He turned the elder wand once over in his hand, feeling a slight, magical hum from the instrument of power. The resurrection stone sat heavy in his pocket, the cloak hung loosely at his side. Master of death, he thought to himself, and laughed aloud, startling the slumbering paintings of the headmasters. A true master of death would have been able to save his friends.\n\t\n“Are you quite all right, Harry?” The suddenness of the question, rather than it’s force, nearly caused Harry to jump out of his skin. He whirled around to find himself face-to-face with the portrait of Dumbledore. Instantly, Harry returned to those long, hellish nights spent poring over the pensieve. Harry had never taken quite as quickly to these lessons as he had to occlumency. \n\n“I’m fine, thanks,” Harry replied, fixing his glasses which had been knocked to one side when he jumped, “Sir,” he added hastily, not knowing if the painting still wanted to be referred to as such.  \n\n“You seem troubled,” Dumbledore remarked, his long fingers touched together, peering at Harry over top of his glasses.\n\n“It’s just that I gathered all the Hallows, sir. I should have been master of death, instead, I still feel lost. I guess I don’t understand, sir. I don’t know if Voldemort and I were ever all that different.” \n\n“If you will do me one last kindness, Harry, would you look into the Pensieve? I have one thing I have not yet shown you.” Harry approached the Pensieve with apprehension. There was one memory that clearly was for him, in a small, tube with a golden stopper. Gold for Griffindor. Harry thought back to a choice he had made seven years ago, and wondered how things might have been different. He took a deep breath, and made the last plunge.\n\nHarry found himself in Dumbledore’s office, watching Dumbledore and Tom Riddle, in prefect uniform, having one of their discussions. \n\n“But sir!” exclaimed Riddle, “Isn’t it true that Hufflepuff must lose, as they take what’s left! They don’t value intelligence, or bravery, or cleverness at all!” \n\n“Tom, if you still believe that, I fear we have taught you nothing in your years here. As it is, I’m afraid the decision stands. Hufflepuff wins the House Cup.”\n\n“Sir, please reconsider. I don’t understand what merits the house can have.” Riddle looked flustered, a look Harry had seen on his face today, when he saw the arc of red light fly from Harry’s wand.\n\n“Tom, I’m afraid I don’t have a direct hand in the winner. I’m sorry, but that’s all I can do for you today.” Riddle turned and began to walk out of the room. “Tom?” Dumbledore called after him. Riddle turned his face, his body still towards the exit, “You would do well to remember that it’s not house, strength, or even blood that determines greatness. It is the choices that a wizard makes that determines how he will be remembered.” Riddle turned on his heel without a word, and descended the staircase. \n\nThe memory over, Harry shook himself off. He sat for a long time in Dumbledore’s office, thinking to himself. Then, as though he had been planning this moment his whole life, he pulled the green and silver tie from his pocket and unwrapped the Resurrection Stone. Pointing the Elder Wand directly at it, he muttered “Reducto,” and watched as it crumbled apart into nothing. He looked again at the elder wand, giving it one last, look of longing, and then strode over to the sorting hat.\n\n“Oy, who’s there?\"\n\n“It’s Harry Potter. You might remember me from seven years—,”\n\n“Ah yes, I remember you Potter. Here to get sorted again? You could have done great things in Griffindor.”\n\n“No, thanks. I was actually hoping you might store something for me.”\n\n“I’ve only done that for a few wizards and witches, Potter. What is this item?” without saying anything, Harry slipped the Elder Wand from his pocket into the base of the hat. There was silence for a few moments, and then the hat spoke. “I trust you understand what you’re doing?”\n\n“Yes, I do. Perhaps its power can die with me.”\n\n“All right then. Have a good day Mister Potter.” Harry turned one last time to look at the office of the man he hadn’t known was his friend, and then walked down the stairs to the world that lay below.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419631212","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn628qz","link_id":"t3_2qguqi","name":"t1_cn628qz","parent_id":"t3_2qguqi","retrieved_on":1425205277,"score":25,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":25}

{"archived":false,"author":"Chiefmon","body":"Here I stand, my world behind me, the abyss ahead. I know no lands beyond this one, releasing only my shame into the void, and retreating back in. My pack, a label which is arguable, depend on me, and me alone for their survival. They require me to escort them as they traverse the void, peering into the Otherlands. The many corruptions and abominations from beyond that threaten us are only kept at by my desperate wails. Are their thirsts satiated by my outcries, or do they only find it amusing? I don't know, and I fear the latter more than anything else.\n\nMael-maan, the first of many darknesses, dubbed as such by the others, wears many faces, changing appearance and voice to suit its needs. It's arrival is daily, but its morphing, twisted form is such that it can continuously deceive the weak ones into letting it into our domain and graciously accepting their Trojan horses into our home. Once, I risked everything to strike out at the beast, wounding it, if only for the moment. The others restrained me, fearing for my life, believing my attack to be folly and that it would only anger the Mael-Maan. They apologized profusely, no doubt begging for my life. However, my attack was not in vain, for it never dared step across the world border again. It still tries and manipulate the others with gifts and words, but I destroy what of it that I can. The others are angered by my defiance of the Mael-Maan, fearful of his retaliation. They will thank me, someday.\n\nThere is another of my kind, or at least, it used to be. It resides in the Otherworlds, and watches me, unwavering. It was not my kin. My pure, diminutive size, needed for stealth and grace, was unlike his burly and grotesque form. Its head looked to be warped inward, teeth constantly bared. Then there was another. And another. Its taint, its corruption, its *disease*, it was creating more of them. And I could be its next victim. Would I betray my pack? Would I become such a twisted mimic of my former self? I had only the one thing that repelled the Mael-Maan, my cry. Truly, they were former kin, for their wretched screams, although broken and worn, were that of mine. As I tried and strained to outscreech them, my weaker companion held me back and pulled me to retreat. While we may have escaped, I can only fear their spread.\n\nThen there are the Hahtted. I know not what they are, nor if they are truly evil. But they cannot be trusted. Even my pack is not protected from their possession. Perhaps they are innocent spirits, phasing through others, lost in death. Or are they demons slipping in and out of existence as they look for suitable hosts? There are few symptoms of their afflictions, but they are all clearly something otherworldly. Their faces darken in the same light that illuminates the others'. The mark of the curse protrudes from their heads, seemingly invisible to the others, blending in with them, living their lives for them. But oddest of all, they appear when the Heaven Sphere shines brightest above, and appear immune to its harsh gaze. Is this because they are actually creatures of the light, or creatures so dark that even light cannot phase them? While my dependents have the luxury of optimism, welcoming those afflicted within our domain, I cannot allow such a risk. Especially when they are already so far gone that they will actively pursue this curse, taking the mark upon themselves. They are children, becoming upset when I take away the dangerous things they wish to play with, screaming and yelling when I destroy the marks of the curse. I do not blame them. \n\nI shall take the burden of their hatred if it shall keep them safe. I do this not out of greed, or hopes of equality. I do this out of my own will and my own obligation to repay them for rescuing me from the eternal prison I had been banished to. I was betrayed by a group I had called my kin, and this group, I have adopted in exchange for their help, no matter whether it was born of altruism, or simple capriciousness. This wide abyss that we are stranded in the middle of, it is wrought with danger and deception. I do not know if my own efforts are enough to protect them from it, but it is all I can do to scream into the abyss and appear a darkness stronger than the rest. The others are weak, and their instincts tend toward submission, but I will not let their pride sink any further, I *will* make them strong. \n\nI am tired, and weary, but my watch shall not end this day.

He didn't have one of the worst ones, the ones that killed with pain, and anguish. Not Virtex, or the Scronk, or God forbid, Black Jitters, but what he had would prove fatal nonetheless. But this was no time to lament his own fate. The first batch would be here soon, he had to hurry. Sitting in the large, soft chair, he placed the Halo^tm on his head. \"Activate\" he said, to initiate the main activation sequence. A flash of light and color, and he found himself standing in what appeared to be an endless white space.\n\n\"Welcome to GeoSculpt, your All-in-one virtual reality modeling suite. Would you like to create a new file, or open a saved world?\" a female voice echoed unseen from the distance, accompanied by the usual sound file for the program, a pleasant little jingle that reminded him of a lullaby.\n\n\"New file, please.\" the Sculptor replied. The system didn't understand manners, wasn't complex enough for it. But something in him made him say please all the same. The rote practice of dealing with real people, he supposed.\n\n\"File name?\" the female voice sounded back. Janice. He decided to call her Janice. Not out loud, she (or it) would never understand having a name, but just for himself, she would be Janice.\n\n\"Greenbriar Orphanage.\"\n\n\"Saving Greenbriar_Orphanage.geo,\" Janice dutifully responded. \"Saving complete. Please select toolbars.\"\n\n\"Um, give me Earth, Temperate Forest, and Night, for now. Left-aligned, please.\"\n\n\"Loading toolbars. To access the tutorials, please...\"\n\n\"Skip,\" he interrupted, cancelling the pre-recorded message. He had been a Sculptor for three years, and was way past the point where the tutorials could help. Raising his left hand, he opened the Earth toolbar with a simple swiping motion. Plains, Mountains, Coast, and a few other pre-made templates were listed in front of him. There was also a free-form option, but he disliked hand-sculpting basic terrain. Not that he had time for it today, anyway.A grabbing gesture, and a flick of the wrist loaded the \"Plains\" template. The stark white surroundings were replaced with a flat, dirt field. It seemed to extend off into the horizon, disappearing out of sight, but he knew the boundary was only a few hundred yards away. The file sizes were large, but not infinite.\n\n\"Close Earth toolbar, please.\" The toolbar vanished with a simple ding noise, no response from Janice. For a brief moment, he felt a small tinge of loneliness at her absence. He quickly brushed it off as silly, and retuned to work. A second swipe opened the Temperate Forest toolbar, with Pine, Oak, Maple, Birch, Grasses, Shrubs, and a scrollbar to reveal more options. Not having the time to get fancy, he placed an average assortment of trees around the perimeter of the property, using the built-in \"randomize\" feature.\n\nSatisfied with that, he began scrolling through the Grasses sub-menu, looking for that perfect \"feel\" for the place. The grass was always his favorite detail, having spent many summers as a boy running across manicured lawns on a still-thriving Earth. Those lawns would all be gone now, ra#BADWORDS#ed in the wars, and the Collapse, and the Plague. There had always been many theories as to how the world would end, but no one ever thought it would be \"All of the Above.\" Humanity was dwindling, on the border of extinction. But their Children would live on, so that was a comfort.\n\nSentimentality. No time for it now, he thought. They're coming, and we... we're going. \"That's the stuff...\" he said to no one. Deep green grass, in need of cutting, but not yet unmanageably wild. Perfect for a youthful frolic, should the need arise.\n\n\"Load Large_Farmhouse.bld, Janice.\" he commanded.\n\"Large_Farmhouse.bldjanice: File Not Found\" came the reply in Janice's soft, even tone.\n\n\"Load Large_Farmhouse.bld\" he said, internally chastising himself for his slip-up. She doesn't have a name, not now, not ever. The Children will have names, but not her.\n\n\"File loaded. Would you like the Building Toolbar visible?\"\n\n\"Yes, please. Right-aligned.\" He got to work customizing the building with what it would need for its intended purpose. A few more bedrooms, bunk beds, and an extra bathroom. He used the basic furnishings toolkit to outfit the house for the lives of ten children, and three caretakers. He stockd the fridge and the pantry, filled the cabinets with dishes and the drawers with utensils. Illusions, but necessary for their goals. If you want to raise children right, they need the best home you can give them.\n\nReturning outside, he placed a quaint wooden fence along one side of the property, with power lines just beyond. Everything had to visually make sense, even if it wasn't really functional. The Children couln't guess their world was fake until it was time for them to grow up. He got the sunlight and reflections tuned just the way he wanted them, then switched the rendering to the night sky, his favorite part.\n\nAnother swipe, and the Night toolbar was open. \"Activate gesture control.\" he commanded, more sternly than his previous commands. This was serious stuff, this sculpting of stars, he was about to engage in the Craft of the Gods.\n\n\"Gesture control activated\" Janice demured as he raised his hands towards the sky. A poke of the finger placed the first star. Then another, and another. Soon, he was painting whole constellations in broad strokes. Finally, bringing both hands together over his head, a long sweeping motion painted the band of the Milky Way. Lowering his arms, he put his hands in his pockets, and surveyed his recent work.\n\n\"Not bad,\" he thought. The galactic band was directly overhead, a straight band of uncountable colors. \"Maybe if I...\"\n\nHe stared at the sweeping mass of stars, and began to lean to the side slowly, tilting the night sky as he did so. When the angle was just right, he sighed, and thought, \"Yeah, just there.\"\n\n\"Gesture control off, please. Save file, and finalize.\"\n\n\"Gesture control off. File saved. File uploading to WorldServer. Upload complete.\"\n\nHis work was now part of the Virtual World, the last creation of mankind. The safe haven for their Children, the AIs spawned from their machines during the last years of the wars. The Earth was a ruined husk, devastated by the wars, and the environmental Collapse. The Plagues were killing off the last of the survivors. But in these virtual worlds, in gigantic machines meandering through lazy orbits among the planets of the solar system, the Children would live on. They would grow up, raised by the best virtual avatars humanity could program. And when the time was right, they would be shown the truth, and given a choice. Stay here, in this virtual world, or take cybernetic bodies, and explore physical reality. The Sculptor wondered which they would choose.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419717378","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn6umpk","link_id":"t3_2qjulb","name":"t1_cn6umpk","parent_id":"t3_2qjulb","retrieved_on":1425191712,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}

{"archived":false,"author":"Xethaios","body":"As it turned out Attack on #BADWORDS#an was on to something. \n\nAbout the walls, I mean. There are no weird giant cannibal humans eating people. No cannons or mutant humans or anything. Just bat#BADWORDS# weird aliens and their strange methods of war. \n\nThey came hurtling down in what looked like teardrops. They would land in the ocean, then swim with terrifying speed to the costs to slaughter the costal cities. Weird as these aliens were, they were vicious and deadly and worst of all, terrifyingly clever and brilliant birds of war. They held no remorse, took no prisoners. They didn't even ransack the cities and towns. They just destroyed them. They'd place something in the bodies of the deceased, and in a few days small creatures would devour the captured cities and make haste towards the oceans and lakes. \n\nIslands like Hawaii, #BADWORDS#an, Taiwan all fell first. The outer fifty miles of the US, and much of Europe was taken. The Koreas, barely working together, put up quite a fight, but eventually they, too, fell.\n\nHoping we could hold them off in Asia and what was left of Europe, what was left of humanity was ushered into Russia, then China as they started approaching from the Arctic ocean and worked their way south.\n\nOddly enough, the Great Wall of China is what saved us. Once we closed the gates, humanity was safe, we figured. At least until they climbed the wall. But they didn't. They never did. Never made ladders, never tried to even make living ladders. They just bunched at the bottom like a group of blind, moronic ants, which we knew they were not. \n\nSo we captured one. Paralyzed it, brought it into repurposed hospitals for dissection. It was also the only time anybody actually got to see one up close, being so fast that if you were close enough you were already dead. Bodycams aren't good enough to capture them\n\nThey're odd, beetle-like creatures, with #BADWORDS#uely human torsos. Their bodies were varying shades of green, brown and occasional orange. Their legs were blunt and thick, claws at the end of their too-long arms thin and razor sharp, seeming to fit into a shovel-like appendage with the hand flat. But none of this indicated why they wouldn't even attempt to climb the walls, or why they bunched up like ants at the base.\n\nWe did some digging in their brains. Turns out their eyes are completely useless- they see with scents, the wind, the magnetic field of the planet. Their brains are being fed information from the eyes, but it's ignored. We did not determine why. But we did more analysis. I don't know the particulars, but from what I know, and I'm probably horribly mangaling this, the concept of something being above them in the literal sense is foreign to them. Slopes or metal walls or wood walls, sure, something atop the wall, yeah why not. Something on the other side of thick stone walls? They don't understand it or something, I don't know. I'm an engineer, not a neuroscientist.\n\nWe did enough dissecting and digging to finally be able to simulate its behaviour with software. We set about designing vehicles that would be able to safely leave the walls and head outwards, to fight and build walls around major mines, factories, anything to sustain the population crammed within the Great Wall. In the end, the design ended up being a giant, ugly cube with wheels. Like a heavily armored, low-riding bus. \n\nWithing months the living conditions in the wall improved, as we started digging down, reclaiming land used for factories and farming for living space. We outsourced all food growth, manufacturing, research to smaller Wall Compounds outside the land. We built two-lane high-speed railroads to travel between them all.\n\nI don't know where I was going with this and I'm not happy with it, but whatever.

{"archived":false,"author":"AshH654","body":"Welcome back to another year at [INSERT HIGH SCHOOL #BADWORDS#LE HERE]\n\nOver the last 6 weeks you have been free. Your time has been yours to use as you will, for the better or for the worst. But now, it is time to return to your place of learning. Your refuge from the horrors of normal society. And with that comes a time of mental clarity. You are young adults now, and this coming of age allows you to see clearly now. The fog of youth has faded from your eyesight.\n\nSo, you may be asking, what does this mean? This means that you are able to see through the lies that you are told by your parents and other adult figures, and you are able to accurately make your own assessments about the world around you. And that is what I want to talk about today. The world around you. \n\nOur society is based on a political system called democracy. Democracy is the idea that everyone gets a vote, everyone has a say. Now, we could all just vote on each and every law or political change made, but that would be one big mess. Instead what we have chosen to do in this country is have a democratic vote on who makes the big decisions for us. We choose who we want to be in charge, who our Prime Minister is. In politics, there is a lot of fighting. You may have heard the name UKIP in the news a lot recently too. They are a controversial political party that want to be in charge. \n\nBecause of all the fighting in government and all the battles about trying to be the ones in charge, very little has changed through our generation. Very little has improved in our way of life since the end of WWII. It is down to all of you, the bright young people sitting in front of me now, to change the way that society works. It is up to all of you to become affuent in the ways of the world, and then tear them down. \n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, my generation is too focused on money, on power, to be able to appreciate the little things in life, or to help save the world from climate change or nuclear disaster. The world right now, the world run by my generation, ignores countries in Africa and Asia when they ask for help. There are people out there in countries such as Ghana that have no food or water, and yet the USA throw away enough food to help those countries out for years. \n\nImagine what we could all do for the world if we were all equal. If we helped each other out of predicaments instead of looking down on the people around us because of their sexuality, their gender, the colour of their skin. If everyone had equal schooling and no one was left behind in the dirt. If we could all collaborate. We could invent reliable and renewable power, eradicate diseases, even conquer the stars, discover new planets. Maybe not in your time, or even your children's time, but one day, we might even meet another sentient species.\n\nBut not today. Today, we are squabbling about who is in charge or who gets this land or who we go to war with. While not many people understand why the so called important people are obsessed with power, we have no choice but to go along with it. But today. Today you have classes.

{"archived":false,"author":"Dante-Alighieri","body":"It was a peculiar request. Kill a man on death row. His name was Francis Yurik and he was all over the news. He had killed a family in cold blood and written various words and lyrics, true Manson style. The contract was for $350,000. An insane amount in this profession. I have no clue why the client wanted this person dead. They were probably related to the victim somehow. \n\nI had done prison hits before. They were easy enough. I had some wardens in my pocket and all I requested is that I be allowed in, usually as a guard. I would step in, kill them in a prison sort of way -usually using a shiv- and leave without any trace.\n\nThis hit was still strange. Most prison hits were to stop someone from squealing, or punish them for it. Snitches get s#BADWORDS#ches is an understatement; snitches get cement shoes and a .45 through the head is a bit more accurate. \n\nThe hit itself was easy. He was getting the needle in two weeks and security in the prison was beefed up. Numerous papar#BADWORDS#i and the common crazy serial killer lovers were outside of the prison trying to get pictures of Francis. It was easy for me to get in with e disguise of a local newsman. Jessie Briar was the warden of the prison and he owed me a few favors.\n\n\"What do I care if you kill this guy?\" Jessie had asked, \"he's getting killed in a few weeks anyway. Save my prison some money if you take him out.\"\n\nThat had made it easy to get in. The metal detector I went through had been tampered with and the guards knew it. They were told to let me go through it anyone. That way, they have tapes to prove I didn't have any weapons on me. The prison layout was easy to memorize. It was simple:\n\nLobby&gt;hallway&gt;courtyard\n\nThe courtyard had access to cell blocks A-D. E and F were a bit more secure. E was for the serious offenders and solitary confinement. F was for Punk City, properly known as Protective Custody. Francis was in F and the guards there were appointed by the governor. That meant I would have to sneak past them.\n\nThat part was easy. Breaking into a cell is harder than breaking out. The guards never noticed me once I was in there and I looked at the paper slip I had been given. \n\nFrancis Yurik\nMaximum Security\n$350,000\nCell F216\n\nThe cell would be located on the second row, 8 down from the left. It was were I found him. He looked up at me and saw the dark suit I was wearing.\n\n\"I ain't talking to no more Feds,\" He spat. I stuck a 'prison' made firecracker into the lock and blew it open. Francis looked shocked at the now open cell door.\n\n\"You here to free--\" I ended the sentence by plunging a sharpened copper pipe into his chest. The heart is a hard organ to find. Most people thing it's just under their collar bone on the left side. That is actually the top of your lung. The heart is located about inch away from your nipple almost dead center. \n\nFrancis died very quickly, his brain being shut down by lack of blood. I slipped a surgical glove on and used the gloved hand to write one of the lyrics from his crime scene on the wall of the cell before leaving. It was another easy hit and the news was talking about how the prisoners committed the crime against him.\n\nMy job was done and it was done well.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419812126","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn7tqoh","link_id":"t3_2qn948","name":"t1_cn7tqoh","parent_id":"t3_2qn948","retrieved_on":1425175049,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":3}

{"archived":false,"author":"CannonballCat","body":"*First time writing something so it’ll probably be rubbish but here goes.*\n\n\nAt first we resisted. After all, the whole brutal conquest and reign of terror didn't exactly sound very appealing. And well, we were told that if we didn't then we would all be exterminated when He came. 30 years of brutal fighting, young boys leaving their homes to join the army and fight the Dark Lord, thousands dead and more injured beyond recognition. And still we lost.\n\n\nGods, I remember the terror of those first few months. I was there when they tore the old banners from the castle walls and flew the red skull in their place. I watched when the surviving generals of the King's army were executed, one after the other. And I'll admit I shed a tear when the king himself swung on the gallows. \n\n\nI'm just a simple farmer, with a small plot of land by the border. Biggest threat I ever have to deal with is the occasional band of goblins coming down from the hills. The kings guard were no help, We're too far from the city for them to get here in time, and even then we're hardly important enough for them to bother. And despite the stories you can't rely on some random wanderer showing up at just the right time to fight them off. So we stay inside and let them take and burn what they want and just rebuild afterwards.\n\n\nThat's the first change I noticed. The week after the king's execution we heard a band coming down from the hills. And so my wife and I boarded up the doors and windows and waited for them to leave, just as usual. It wouldn't have been more than ten minutes before we heard a tremendous screech high above. Peeking out from a gap in the boards, I was just able to catch a glimpse of what could only be described as a huge bat-like monstrosity, with a rider armoured in black on its back, the red skull painted on his side. There were about forty or so goblins in this particular group, but within a very short space of time there wasn't a single one left standing. You know the other thing about the king's guard was that if by some miracle they did show up to drive the raiders off, they would always just leave the fields scattered with mutilated goblin corpses that we would have to spend hours cleaning up and disposing of. Well I don't know the right name for that black creature but I do know this: they like eating goblins.\n\n\nThat was the last time we were raided. When the Dark Lord found out that the goblins had been raiding along the border freely he made sure that they were exterminated fully. \"Protecting his profits\" was the official statement. I don't really care why, but it made it a lot easier to sleep at night once those little green bas#BADWORDS#s were gone. You noticed it in other things too, the roads became a lot safer to travel on since the penalty for theft had become a lot stricter, and the Black Guard was actually useful at dealing with bandits and law breakers. All purely out of greed and in the interest of protecting his profits of course, you could still be executed if you so much as looked at his Lordship funny but honestly, things here have felt a lot more secure since the invasion. We all cried when the King died, but if it was to happen again I guarantee you there'd be more than a few people cheering. I'd certainly be one of them.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419820135","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn7xp6n","link_id":"t3_2qnp3a","name":"t1_cn7xp6n","parent_id":"t3_2qnp3a","retrieved_on":1425173074,"score":103,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":103}

She let out a lungful of air and broke into a sprint. Oh God just get the door closed.\n\n\"Is everything alright-\" he started as she pounced on him. He wasn't squirming, oh God just let this happen. She could hear music, loud.\n\n\"It's okay,\" he finished, and she ripped open his shirt, near her breaking point.\n\n*...hello, I've waited here for you...*\n\nShe was quivering, she fell down on him, near the foot of the bed.\n\n*...out of her head, she sang...*\n\nHe saw her urgency, she couldn't let up.\n\n*... you wanted it to be... over my head...*\n\nShe couldn't get close enough to him, oh Jack you have no idea.\n\n*...and I wonder...*\n\nThey rolled over and over, shedding inhibiton and clothing.\n\n*...if everything could ever feel this real forever...*\n\nShe couldn't wait any longer, and slammed him to the bed.\n\n*...gotta promise not to stop when I say when...*\n\nMaggie was dancing in the kitchen the whole time.\n\n***\n\n\"Hi gorgeous, is everything okay?\" Maggie asked, as Jen strolled over. She plopped down sideways in her lap and wrapped her arms around her shoulders.\n\n\"Oh God Maggie thank you so much, I... after all this I have no idea... what would I have done if you... if you weren't there for me... What would've happened... I don't even...\" she trailed off, sobbing.\n\n\"Shhh, it's okay, everything is okay.\"\n\n\"And all this time I've been horrible, I've second guessed you on everything, I... you're better than I can ever give you credit for, you're...\"\n\n\"Glad to be here, for a friend.\"\n\nJen squeezed even tighter. For once it was Maggie resigning herself to the inevitable.\n\n\"Jen, this is what I do.\"\n\n\"I know, I get it now, it's just...\"\n\n\"Surreal?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Like somehow this is the dream.\"\n\n\"You're livin it, baby.\"\n\nJen let out a tense laugh, \"thank you.\"\n\n\"Better outcome?\"\n\n\"The best!\" Jen said with glee, squeezing again.\n\n\"Good,\" Maggie replied, beaming, \"now go in there and squeeze him like that. And know that I love the both of you. Take as much time as you need.\"\n\nJen squeezed one more time then got up and bounced to the back of the apartment.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419820926","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn7y2va","link_id":"t3_2qo44n","name":"t1_cn7y2va","parent_id":"t1_cn7y06c","retrieved_on":1425172895,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":2}

{"archived":false,"author":"supermamajama","body":"\"Breakfast is ready!,\" I shouted from downstairs, 8 eggs frying on the pan and bacon perfectly dispersing it's porky-woody smoke, throughout the house, at the counter adjacent to me. \"John is definitely going to love this batch,\" I thought.\n\nA minute later, I hear a series of loud, pounding metal sound vibrating off our stairs. \"Quit running John, you're going to wake up your Mother!\" I yelled over my soft shoulders. Suddenly, I feel a soft brush of air below me. I glanced down from my shoulders. There he is standing beside my hip. Looking up at me is this beautiful 9-yr old kid with shiny black wavy hair and soft plushy cheeks, his brown iris' sparkling into a million kaleidoscopic shards from the sun entering the fragile window. Just from one look, you would never believe it. He's the fastest person alive. \n\n30 minutes later, my wife woke from her sweet slumber. I hear the running of the faucet and stomping of her feet above me. 20 minutes later, leaning under the archway to the kitchen, my wife of 2 children. Her brown hair shimmering from the sunlight coming from the window above her. You can see the dust floating and falling on top of her head. Her sweet soft lips creased by her smile. And her eyes softly squinting as she does it. The glow of the lime green wall complimenting her sweet white skin. \"This woman is beautiful,\" I thought, \"I'm the luckiest man alive.\" The story of how we met, never fails to make me laugh. Like my son, she's not what you think she is. This delicate, small framed pregnant women could never be the same person who snapped the Eiffel tower like a twig and used it as a weapon against \"#BADWORDS#an\"? I agree, she did receive a lot of publicity about that. \n\n\"Honey, I love you!\" she says, sitting adjacent from the table. \"Yah, Daddy, I love you too,\" John followed sincerely. I promised to never shed a tear in front of them, because it would make her worry. But on that fine perfect morning I broke it.  \n\nAfter breakfast, she flew-off to work. And after flying in a straight 45 degree angle, her suitcase suddenly opens, pieces of white-paper scatters throughout the air. Of course, she picks all of the pieces in the blink of an eye. And before you knew it she is barely visible. You could just feel the level of her strong and \"lovey\" dexterity. ;) \n\nI was dropping off John when suddenly I feel my car rise from the ground. John already disappeared-off to get his mother. I looked outside the driver seat window. I suddenly found myself 300 feet above the ground, suspended by a large magnet strapped to a giant robot's arm. The size of it's rusty-green torso indicates that \"Dr. Destroyer\" is fiddling inside. The awkward length of it's legs made me wonder how this thing was able to, run, let alone stand. \n\nI suddenly woke up from the erratic shaking of the car. I shuffled to find the closest thing I could hold on to. I latched unto the gear stick. Seconds later the shaking intensifies, I lose my grip. Just when I start fumbling around the car, the driver side door suddenly unlatched. I fall out of the driver side door. However, I catch the last bit of the driver side of the window. Now, I was panicking! I averted my eyes from looking down. My belt-buckle unfastened and I can feel it slowly sinking down my feet. The shaking was more intense. I eventually lose my grip. I fell, of what seemed like an eternity, from three feet above the ground. Seeing how humiliating this situation is, I tried to hold in my grin. I looked around to grasp where or what this strange location I was dropped in. Where am I-200 miles away from town? I realize I am in the middle of Talackachumia Desert. I hear nimble footsteps approaching behind me. I turned around and see this strange figure nearing me. He is wearing a dirty white lab coat with green and red chemical stains. He is owning a wild, frizzy red hair that are darting in all corners, and his bushy white eyebrows is indicating that this fellow is mental. He is well-known for his bad brown-yellow teeth and thick glasses. Meet my friend, \"Dr. Destroyer.\" You see, 15x or more a year, Dr. Destroyer picks me up at a unsuspecting location; sometimes at a bar, my house, or occasionally a run to the mail just to solicit an angry response from my wife. Apparently, she hurt his feelings and now he's bent on killing me, it never has never worked, though. He swings his pliers, and knocks me unconscious.  \n\nI wake up in a dark room with flashing red lights. My hands and feet are bound. I am in some kind of interrogation room. I take a deep breath. \"I've experienced worse,\" I think to myself, \"any time now, my wife and son, will bust me out of this mediocre-looking confinement, 2 hours before dinner-time.\" \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419847426","downs":0,"edited":"1419848196","gilded":0,"id":"cn878cl","link_id":"t3_2qo5h6","name":"t1_cn878cl","parent_id":"t3_2qo5h6","retrieved_on":1425168559,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":6}

Black work shoes sit near the rug. This job has been excruciating. Although it's only my second week the mailbox has been filled with complaints and grievances. The only thing keeping me attracted to this job is the pay - the phenomenal salary. Even at my wage it doesn't even seem like I could buy a vacation in paradise with how busy I am. The ignition rattles and my car fires up.\n\nI arrive and walk into the marble striped office building. I avoid eye contact with the receptionist in red. She usually gives me the creeps. Sitting there all-day, relaying endless paperwork and phone calls. Her smile is the worst part. Even after explaining that I have a girlfriend, she continues to seductively eye me up and down. If she weren't so damn pretty I would tell her to stop. \n\nI lay my attache case on the desk and pause at a stack of complaints, memos, and a red envelop. One reads *... more abuse from Dave Arger during casual meeting*. Again? I quickly send an email to the address, promising a severe behavior intervention for Arger. While at my desktop I open up a poster I designed for the company, Hadeson Inc. Up front and center is our slogan, *You pay and we reform*. It looks nice. After sorting through some papers I decide that coffee sounds good.\n\nI pour a cup of extremely hot Joe in the bleak looking break room. It scolds my hands despite being in a ceramic thermos. \"Holy #BADWORDS#,\" I yell. Before I can begin running water over the burn, the receptionist enters.\n\n\"What did you just say? Holy #BADWORDS#?\"\n\n\"Yes! Jesus Christ!\" I exclaim in agony.\nShe looks at me at first in fear, then in sick anger.\n\n\"Watch your #BADWORDS# mouth. We don't say that around her.\"\n\n\"Say what?!\"\n\nThen it hit me.\n\n\"You're FIRED!\"\n\nand I plunged into the abyss.\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1419854481","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"cn88jvn","link_id":"t3_2qp1x8","name":"t1_cn88jvn","parent_id":"t3_2qp1x8","retrieved_on":1425167943,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"WritingPrompts","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","ups":1}
